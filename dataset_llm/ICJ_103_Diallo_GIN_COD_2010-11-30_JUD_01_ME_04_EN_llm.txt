 1. I voted against subparagraph (6) of the operative part of the Judg-
ent, which “[f]inds that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not
olated Mr. Diallo’s direct rights as associé in Africom-Zaire and Afri-
ntainers-Zaire”, since I believe that the unlawful and arbitrary charac-
   of Mr. Diallo’s arrest, detention and expulsion (subparagraphs (2) to
   of the operative part) resulted in the violation of his direct rights as
socié in the two companies.

4. This letter, sent to the Prime Minister by public corporations in the
RC in which the State holds a substantial portion of the capital, reveals
e true reason for the detention and expulsion of Mr. Diallo, namely the
 al proceedings which he brought to recover the debts owed to Afri-
ntainers-Zaire by Congolese companies. It is of little significance that
e letter is dated after the expulsion decree, since it is based on the judg-
ent given against Zaire Shell on 13 June 1995 by the Kinshasa Tribunal
 grande instance.

 5. Furthermore, the Court has itself pointed out that
   “it is difficult not to discern a link between Mr. Diallo’s expulsion
   and the fact that he had attempted to recover debts which he
   believed were owed to his companies by, amongst others, the
   Zairean State or companies in which the State holds a substantial
   portion of the capital, bringing cases for this purpose before the
   civil courts” (Judgment, para. 82).
 t the Court has not drawn the consequences in terms of the infringe-
ents of Mr. Diallo’s direct rights as associé that were to result from the
pulsion.
6. The DRC authorities therefore clearly wished to force Mr. Diallo
 t of the territory of their country, so that he could no longer exercise
  direct rights as associé and gérant of Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-
 ire. It is thus difficult to understand how the Court can find (in
bparagraph (6) of the operative part) that the DRC has not violated
ese rights, when the very purpose of the expulsion of Mr. Diallo was to
event him from taking care of his companies. This is tantamount to
knowledging that the authorities of that country were able to get rid of
r. Diallo in this way and keep him from managing his affairs — which


 iftly went into decline — without committing any breach at all of inter-
 tional law, which allows Mr. Diallo’s State of nationality to raise the
 ue of the DRC’s responsibility for wrongful acts that infringed
r. Diallo’s direct rights as associé.
 7. Such is the extent to which the findings of the majority on this point
ay represent a serious precedent, if they are perceived as giving “carte
anche” for ploys designed to neutralize foreign investors by expelling
em from the territory in which they are carrying on their activities.
 situation of this kind is all the more troubling because it is accepted,
  this case, that Mr. Diallo did in fact become the sole associé of the
 o companies, and that since he was “fully in charge and in control of
 ricom-Zaire, he was also, directly or indirectly, fully in charge and in
ntrol of Africontainers-Zaire” (Judgment, para. 110).
 8. It is true that, according to the Barcelona Traction jurisprudence,
ere is a distinction between the rights of shareholders and those of the
mpany, so that an infringement of the latter does not necessarily involve
breach of the former (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company,
mited (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970,
 36, para. 46). However, a forced separation between the sole associé
 d his company is likely to result in a violation of the rights of both. Since
at associé has been prevented from exercising his rights, the company
ll be like a ship without a rudder and will inevitably founder ; that was
 be the case with Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire.

  participate and vote in general meetings, the right to be appointed
rant and to exercise that function, the right to oversee and monitor the
anagement of the companies, and the right to property over the parts
ciales (Judgment, para. 116).
 10. On the right to take part and vote in general meetings, the Court
 serves that there is no evidence of a general meeting of either company
ing held before or after the expulsion of Mr. Diallo, a necessary condi-
 n for him to participate in such a meeting. It therefore asks whether
r. Diallo was deprived of the right to convene a general meeting, which
ust be held on Congolese territory, and concludes that such was not the
se (ibid., para. 121). The Court further adds that Mr. Diallo could have
 d himself represented by a proxy.
 11. Such reasoning, based on the purely formal aspect of Mr. Diallo’s
 ect right to convene general meetings of his companies, which must be
ld in the DRC, takes no account whatsoever of the nature of his con-
ction with them. It can readily be understood that, as the sole associé,
r. Diallo himself directly exercised the powers vested in the general
eeting, for example the allocation of profits, and that in reality the issue
hich arose following his expulsion was not so much the right to convene
 general meeting as that of exercising the functions assigned to it.
early, he was the only person able to do that, and he was prevented
om doing so as a result of his expulsion.


 12. The majority, noting that Mr. Diallo could appoint a proxy for
 ricom-Zaire, though not for Africontainers-Zaire, has taken the for-
alistic approach almost to the point of caricature, stating that
Mr. Diallo, acting as associé of Africontainers-Zaire, could appoint the
 presentative or agent’ of Africom-Zaire as his proxy for a general
eeting of Africontainers-Zaire” (Judgment, para. 125).
 13. On the basis of the fact that Mr. Diallo is a partner with Africom-
 ire (of which he is the sole associé) in Africontainers-Zaire, the major-
  took the view that, by appointing a proxy from the former company,
  would no longer be debarred by the provisions of Article 22 of the
 ticles of Incorporation of Africontainers-Zaire. Formal contortions of
 s kind are surprising, especially when the issue is ultimately the same,
 mely, that Mr. Diallo was prevented from genuinely exercising the
nctions assigned to the general meeting of either of the companies, in
hich he is the sole associé.

 isdiction, that “Mr. Diallo, who was associé in Africom-Zaire and
 ricontainers-Zaire, also held the position of gérant in each of them”,
ere remains the question of whether his right to exercise the functions of
at position was violated by the DRC. In its Judgment on the merits,
e Court considers that “[w]hile the performance of Mr. Diallo’s duties
 gérant may have been rendered more difficult by his presence outside
e country, Guinea has failed to demonstrate that it was impossible to
 ry out those duties” (ibid., para. 135). But how could that be demonstrated ?
as it not sufficient to look back at the context of the expulsion of
r. Diallo, who had been blacklisted by the Congolese authorities, which
 d accused him of corruption and of having “breached Zairean public
der, especially in the economic, financial and monetary areas” (expul-
 n decree of 31 October 1995), in order for the Court to conclude that
 had become impossible for him ipso facto to perform his duties as
rant, since he was no longer able to liaise with his Congolese discussion
 rtners, in particular the public services involved with the debts owed to
  companies ?

e actions of management, and observes that “[w]hile it may have been
e case that Mr. Diallo’s detentions and expulsion from the DRC ren-
red the business activity of the companies more difficult, they simply
uld not have interfered with his ability to oversee and monitor the
rance, wherever he may have been” (Judgment, para. 147). Here again, the
ourt goes no further than a statement of principle which has no connec-
 n with the reality at issue, especially when it is appreciated to what
tent such monitoring requires an actual presence in the country con-
rned of the person responsible for it, who in this case is the sole associé,
en if the latter succeeds in appointing local collaborators in the DRC.
 16. As regards Mr. Diallo’s right to property over his parts sociales,
cluding his right to receive any dividends or any monies payable in the
ent of the companies being liquidated, the Court confines itself to stating


at “[t]here is . . . no evidence that any dividends were ever declared or
at any action was ever taken to wind up the companies” (Judgment,
 ra. 157). And yet Mr. Diallo lived well on the income from his com-
 nies while he was resident in the DRC !
 17. As for the power to decide on the dissolution of the company,
hich lies with the general meeting (Article 99 of the 1887 Decree), this is
 theory a collective act which must be voted for by the associés, but in
e present case, the decision lay with Mr. Diallo. Having been expelled,
 was impossible for him in practice to carry out the winding-up and
 uidation of his companies and to realize the remainder of their
sets, leaving aside the fact that those companies, neglected and deprived
  income from the debts owed to them by the Congolese State, had in
e meantime totally collapsed. It may be true that Mr. Diallo was not
  mally deprived of his right to property over his parts sociales, but the fact
 that he was completely deprived of the usus and fructus of that right,
  ce he could neither draw dividends from them nor actually do with
em as he wished.

 esult of his expulsion, amounted in my view to the DRC depriving him
  his direct rights as associé, thereby committing wrongful acts which
gage its international responsibility. By distinguishing, in its Judgment
  24 May 2007 on preliminary objections, between the rights of associés
 d those of the companies, the Court sought to take into account the
  al structure of the latter ; in its Judgment of 30 November 2010 on the
erits, by refusing to take account of Mr. Diallo’s right to exercise his
 hts as associé, the Court has left those rights devoid of any real scope.
