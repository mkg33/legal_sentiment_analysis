15. The Court is thus confronted with the situation contemplated by
Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Statute, that “Whenever one of the parties
does not appear before the Court, or fails to defend its case, the other
party may call upon the Court to decide in favour of its claim”. Paragraph
2 of that Article, however, also provides: “The Court must, before doing
so, satisfy itself, not only that it has jurisdiction in accordance with
Articles 36 and 37, but also that the claim is well founded in fact and
law.”

16. The present case turns essentially on questions of international
law, and the facts requiring the Court’s consideration in adjudicating
upon the Applicant’s claim either are not in dispute or are attested by
documentary evidence. Such evidence emanates in part from the Govern-
ment of Iceland, and has not been specifically contested, and there does
not appear to be any reason to doubt its accuracy. The Government of
Iceland, it is true, declared in its above-mentioned letter of 11 January
1974 that “it did not accept or acquiesce in any of the statements of fact
or allegations or contentions of law contained in the Memorials of the
Parties concerned” (emphasis added). But such a general declaration of
non-acceptance and non-acquiescence cannot suffice to bring into ques-
tion facts which appear to be established by documentary evidence, nor
can it change the position of the applicant Party, or of the Court, which
remains bound to apply the provisions of Article 53 of the Statute.

17. It is to be regretted that the Government of Iceland has failed to
appear in order to plead its objections or to make its observations against
the Applicant’s arguments and contentions in law. The Court however,
as an international judicial organ, is deemed to take judicial notice of
international law, and is therefore required in a case falling under
Article 53 of the Statute, as in any other case, to consider on its own
initiative all rules of international law which may be relevant to the
settlement of the dispute. It being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain
and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the
burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be
imposed upon any of the parties, for the law lies within the judicial
knowledge of the Court. In ascertaining the law applicable in the present
case the Court has had cognizance not only of the legal arguments
submitted to it by the Applicant but also of those contained in various
communications addressed to it by the Government of Iceland, and in
documents presented to the Court. The Court has thus taken account of
the legal position of each Party. Moreover, the Court has been assisted
by the answers given by the Applicant, both orally and in writing, to
questions asked by Members of the Court during the oral proceedings or
immediately thereafter. It should be stressed that in applying Article 53



of the Statute in this case, the Court has acted with particular circum-
spection and has taken special care, being faced with the absence of the
respondent State.

rules of international law, it would still be necessary for the Court to



determine in that context the role and function which those rules reserve
to the concept of preferential rights and that of conservation of fish
stocks. Thus, whatever conclusion the Court may reach in regard to
preferential rights and conservation measures, it is bound to examine
these questions with respect to this case. Consequently, the suggested
restriction on the Court’s competence not only cannot be read into the
terms of the compromissory clause, but would unduly encroach upon the
power of the Court to take into consideration all relevant elements in
administering justice between the Parties.

49. The Applicant has challenged the Regulations promulgated by
the Government of Iceland on 14 July 1972, and since the Court has to
pronounce on this challenge, the ascertainment of the law applicable
becomes necessary. As the Court stated in the Fisheries case:

“The delimitation of sea areas has always an international aspect;
it cannot be dependent merely upon the will of the coastal State as
expressed in its municipal law. Although it is true that the act of
delimitation is necessarily a unilateral act, because only the coastal
State is competent to undertake it, the validity of the delimitation
with regard to other States depends upon international law.” (I.C.J.
Reports 1951, p. 132.)

The Court will therefore proceed to the determination of the existing
rules of international law relevant to the settlement of the present dispute.

50. The Geneva Convention on the High Seas of 1958, which was
adopted “as generally declaratory of established principles of interna-
tional law”, defines in Article 1 the term “high seas” as ““all parts of the
sea that are not included in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a
State”. Article 2 then declares that “The high seas being open to all
nations, no State may validly purport to subject any part of them to its
sovereignty” and goes on to provide that the freedom of the high seas
comprises, inter alia, both for coastal and non-coastal States, freedom of
navigation and freedom of fishing. The freedoms of the high seas are
however made subject to the consideration that they “shall be exercised
by all States with reasonable regard to the interests of other States in
their exercise of the freedom of the high seas”.

51. The breadth of the territorial sea was not defined by the 1958
Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. It is true
that Article 24 of this Convention limits the contiguous zone to 12 miles
“from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured”. At the 1958 Conference, the main differences on the breadth



of the territorial sea were limited at the time to disagreements as to what
limit, not exceeding 12 miles, was the appropriate one. The question of
the breadth of the territorial sea and that of the extent of the coastal
State’s fishery jurisdiction were left unsettled at the 1958 Conference.
These questions were referred to the Second Conference on the Law of
the Sea, held in 1960. Furthermore, the question of the extent of the
fisheries jurisdiction of the coastal State, which had constituted a serious
obstacle to the reaching of an agreement at the 1958 Conference, became
gradually separated from the notion of the tertitorial sea. This was a
development which reflected the increasing importance of fishery re-
sources for all States.

52. The 1960 Conference failed by one vote to adopt a text governing
the two questions of the breadth of the territorial sea and the extent of
fishery rights. However, after that Conference the law evolved through
the practice of States on the basis of the debates and near-agreements at
the Conference. Two concepts have crystallized as customary law in
recent years arising out of the general consensus revealed at that Con-
ference. The first is the concept of the fishery zone, the area in which a
State may claim exclusive fishery jurisdiction independently of its territo-
rial sea; the extension of that fishery zone up to a 12-mile limit from the
baselines appears now to be generally accepted. The second is the concept
of preferential rights of fishing in adjacent waters in favour of the coastal
State in a situation of special dependence on its coastal fisheries, this
preference operating in regard to other States concerned in the exploita-
tion of the same fisheries, and to be implemented in the way indicated in
paragraph 57 below.

53. In recent years the question of extending the coastal State’s
fisheries jurisdiction has come increasingly to the forefront. The Court is
aware that a number of States has asserted an extension of fishery limits.
The Court is also aware of present endeavours, pursued under the
auspices of the United Nations, to achieve in a third Conference on the
Law of the Sea the further codification and progressive development of
this branch of the law, as it is of various proposals and preparatory docu-
ments produced in this framework, which must be regarded as manifesta-
tions of the views and opinions of individual States and as vehicles of
their aspirations, rather than as expressing principles of existing law. The
very fact of convening the third Conference on the Law of the Sea
evidences a manifest desire on the part of all States to proceed to the
codification of that law on a universal basis, including the question of
fisheries and conservation of the living resources of the sea. Such a general
desire is understandable since the rules of international maritime law
have been the product of mutual accommodation, reasonableness and
co-operation. So it was in the past, and so it necessarily is today. In the
circumstances, the Court, as a court of law, cannot render judgment sub



specie legis ferendae, or anticipate the law before the legislator has laid it
down.

54. The concept of a 12-mile fishery zone, referred to in paragraph 52
above, as a fertium genus between the territorial sea and the high seas, has
been accepted with regard to Iceland in the substantive provisions of the
1961 Exchange of Notes, and the United Kingdom has also applied the
same fishery limit to its own coastal waters since 1964; therefore this
matter is no longer in dispute between the Parties. At the same time, the
concept of preferential rights, a notion that necessarily implies the exis-
tence of other legal rights in respect of which that preference operates,
has been admitted by the Applicant to be relevant to the solution of the
present dispute. Moreover, the Applicant has expressly recognized
Iceland’s preferential rights in the disputed waters and at the same time
has invoked its own historic fishing rights in these same waters, on the
ground that reasonable regard must be had to such traditional rights by
the coastal State, in accordance with the generally recognized principles
embodied in Article 2 of the High Seas Convention. If, as the Court
pointed out in its dictum in the Fisheries case, cited in paragraph 49
above, any national delimitation of sea areas, to be opposable to other
States, requires evaluation in terms of the existing rules of international
law, then it becomes necessary for the Court, in its examination of the
Icelandic fisheries Regulations, to take those elements into consideration
as well. Equally it has necessarily to take into account the provisions of
the Exchange of Notes of 1961 which govern the relations between the
Parties with respect to Iceland’s fishery limits. The said Exchange of
Notes, which was concluded within the framework of the existing pro-
visions of the law of the sea, was held by the Court, in its Judgment
of 2 February 1973, to be a treaty which is valid and in force.

55. The concept of preferential rights for the coastal State in a situation
of special dependence on coastal fisheries originated in proposals sub-
mitted by Iceland at the Geneva Conference of 1958. Its delegation drew
attention to the problem which would arise when, in spite of adequate
fisheries conservation measures, the yield ceased to be sufficient to satisfy
the requirements of all those who were interested in fishing in a given
area. Iceland contended that in such a case, when a catch-limitation
becomes necessary, special consideration should be given to the coastal
State whose population is overwhelmingly dependent on the fishing
resources in its adjacent waters.

56. An Icelandic proposal embodying these ideas failed to obtain the
majority required, but a resolution was adopted at the 1958 Conference



concerning the situation of countries or territories whose people are
overwhelmingly dependent upon coastal fisheries for their livelihood or
economic development. This resolution, after “recognizing that such
situations call for exceptional measures befitting particular needs” re-
commended that:

*“, . . where, for the purpose of conservation, it becomes necessary to
limit the total catch of a stock or stocks of fish in an area of the high
seas adjacent to the territorial sea of a coastal State, any other States
fishing in that area should collaborate with the coastal State to
secure just treatment of such situation, by establishing agreed
measures which shall recognize any preferential requirements of the
coastal State resulting from its dependence upon the fishery con-
cerned while having regard to the interests of the other States”.

The resolution further recommended that “appropriate conciliation and
arbitral procedures shall be established for the settlement of any disagree-
ment”.

57. At the Plenary Meetings of the 1960 Conference the concept of
preferential rights was embodied in a joint amendment presented by
Brazil, Cuba and Uruguay which was subsequently incorporated by a
substantial vote into a joint United States-Canadian proposal concerning
a 6-mile territorial sea and an additional 6-mile fishing zone, thus totalling
a 12-mile exclusive fishing zone, subject to a phasing-out period. This
amendment provided, independently of the exclusive fishing zone, that
the coastal State had :

““,.. the faculty of claiming preferential fishing rights in any area of
the high seas adjacent to its exclusive fishing zone when it is scientific-
ally established that a special situation or condition makes the exploi-
tation of the living resources of the high seas in that area of funda-
mental importance to the economic development of the coastal State
or the feeding of its population”.

It also provided that:

“A special situation or condition may be deemed to exist when:

(a) The fisheries and the economic development of the coastal State
or the feeding of its population are so manifestly interrelated
that, in consequence, that State is greatly dependent on the
living resources of the high seas in the area in respect of which
preferential fishing is being claimed;

(b) It becomes necessary to limit the total catch of a stock or stocks
of fish in such areas ...”
The contemporary practice of States leads to the conclusion that the


preferential rights of the coastal State in a special situation are to be
implemented by agreement between the States concerned, either bilateral
or multilateral, and, in case of disagreement, through the means for the
peaceful settlement of disputes provided for in Article 33 of the Charter of
the United Nations. It was in fact an express condition of the amendment
referred to above that any other State concerned would have the right to
request that a claim made by a coastal State should be tested and deter-
mined by a special commission on the basis of scientific criteria and of
evidence presented by the coastal State and other States concerned. The
commission was to be empowered to determine, for the period of time
and under the limitations that it found necessary, the preferential rights
of the coastal State, “while having regard to the interests of any other
State or States in the exploitation of such stock or stocks of fish”.

58. State practice on the subject of fisheries reveals an increasing and
widespread acceptance of the concept of preferential rights for coastal
States, particularly in favour of countries or territories in a situation of
special dependence on coastal fisheries. Both the 1958 Resolution and the
1960 joint amendment concerning preferential rights were approved by a
large majority of the Conferences, thus showing overwhelming support
for the idea that in certain special situations it was fair to recognize that
the coastal State had preferential fishing rights. After these Conferences,
the preferential rights of the coastal State were recognized in various
bilateral and multilateral international agreements. The Court’s attention
has been drawn to the practice in this regard of the North-West and
North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commissions, of which 19 maritime States
altogether, including both Parties, are members; its attention has also
been drawn to the Arrangement Relating to Fisheries in Waters Sur-
rounding the Faroe Islands, signed at Copenhagen on 18 December 1973
on behalf of the Governments of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom, and to
the Agreement on the Regulation of the Fishing of North-East Arctic
(Arcto-Norwegian) Cod, signed on 15 March 1974 on behalf of the
Governments of the United Kingdom, Norway and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. Both the aforesaid agreements, in allocating the
annual shares on the basis of the past performance of the parties in the
area, assign an additional share to the coastal State on the ground of its
preferential right in the fisheries in its adjacent waters. The Faroese
agreement takes expressly into account in its preamble “the exceptional
dependence of the Faroese economy on fisheries” and recognizes “that
the Faroe Islands should enjoy preference in waters surrounding the
Faroe Islands”.

_ 59. There can be no doubt of the exceptional dependence of Iceland on
its fisheries. That exceptional dependence was explicitly recognized by
the Applicant in the Exchange of Notes of 11 March 1961, and the Court



has also taken judicial notice of such recognition, by declaring that it is
“necessary to bear in mind the exceptional dependence of the Icelandic
nation upon coastal fisheries for its livelihood and economic develop-
ment” (I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 16, para. 23).

60. The preferential rights of the coastal State come into play only at
the moment when an intensification in the exploitation of fishery resources
makes it imperative to introduce some system of catch-limitation and
sharing of those resources, to preserve the fish stocks in the interests of
their rational and economic exploitation. This situation appears to have
been reached in the present case. In regard to the two main demersal
species concerned—cod and haddock—the Applicant has shown itself
aware of the need for a catch-limitation which has become indispensable
in view of the establishment of catch-limitations in other regions of the
North Atlantic. If a system of catch-limitation were not established in the
Icelandic area, the fishing effort displaced from those other regions might
well be directed towards the unprotected grounds in that area.

61. The Icelandic regulations challenged before the Court have been
issued and applied by the Icelandic authorities as a claim to exclusive
rights thus going beyond the concept of preferential rights. Article 2 of
the Icelandic Regulations of 14 July 1972 states:

“Within the fishery limits all fishing activities by foreign vessels
shall be prohibited in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 33
of 19 June 1922, concerning Fishing inside the Fishery Limits.”

Article 1 of the 1922 Law provides: “Only Icelandic citizens may engage
in fishing in the territorial waters of Iceland, and only Icelandic boats or
ships may be used for such fishing.” The language of the relevant
government regulations indicates that their object is to establish an
exclusive fishery zone, in which all fishing by vessels registered in other
States, including the United Kingdom, would be prohibited. The mode
of implementation of the regulations, carried out by Icelandic govern-
mental authorities vis-a-vis United Kingdom fishing vessels, before the
1973 interim agreement, and despite the Court’s interim measures,
confirms this interpretation.

62. The concept of preferential rights is not compatible with the
exclusion of all fishing activities of other States. A coastal State entitled to
preferential rights is not free, unilaterally and according to its own un-
controlled discretion, to determine the extent of those rights. The charac-
terization of the coastal State’s rights as preferential implies a certain
priority, but cannot imply the extinction of the concurrent rights of other



States, and particularly of a State which, like the Applicant, has for many
years been engaged in fishing in the waters in question, such fishing
activity being important to the economy of the country concerned. The
coastal State has to take into account and pay regard to the position of
such other States, particularly when they have established an economic
dependence on the same fishing grounds. Accordingly, the fact that Iceland
is entitled to claim preferential rights does not suffice to justify its claim
unilaterally to exclude the Applicants fishing vessels from all fishing
activity in the waters beyond the limits agreed to in the 1961 Exchange of
Notes.

* *

63. In this case, the Applicant has pointed out that its vessels have been
fishing in Icelandic waters for centuries and that they have done so in a
manner comparable with their present activities for upwards of 50 years.
Published statistics indicate that from 1920 onwards, fishing of demersal
species by United Kingdom vessels in the disputed area has taken place on
a continuous basis from year to year, and that, except for the period of
the Second World War, the total catch of those vessels has been remark-
ably steady. Similar statistics indicate that the waters in question con-
stitute the most important of the Applicant’s distant-water fishing grounds
for demersal species.

64. The Applicant further states that in view of the present situation of
fisheries in the North Atlantic, which has demanded the establishment of
agreed catch-limitations of cod and haddock in various areas, it would
not be possible for the fishing effort of United Kingdom vessels displaced
from the Icelandic area to be diverted at economic levels to other fishing
grounds in the North Atlantic. Given the lack of alternative fishing
opportunity, it is further contended, the exclusion of British fishing
vessels from the Icelandic area would have very serious adverse con-
sequences, with immediate results for the affected vessels and with
damage extending over a wide range of supporting and related industries.
It is pointed out in particular that wide-spread unemployment would be
caused among all sections of the British fishing industry and in ancillary
industries and that certain ports—Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood—
specially reliant on fishing in the Icelandic area, would be seriously
affected.

65. Iceland has for its part admitted the existence of the Applicant’s
historic and special interests in the fishing in the disputed waters. The
Exchange of Notes as a whole and in particular its final provision re-
quiring Iceland to give advance notice to the United Kingdom of any
extension of its fishery limits impliedly acknowledged the existence of
United Kingdom fishery interests in the waters adjacent to the 12-mile
limit. The discussions which have taken place between the two countries
also imply an acknowledgement by Iceland of the existence of such



interests. Furthermore, the Prime Minister of Iceland stated on 9 Novem-
ber 1971:

“, , . the British have some interests to protect in this connection.
For a long time they have been fishing in Icelandic waters .. . The
well-being of specific British fishing towns may nevertheless to some
extent be connected with the fisheries in Icelandic waters . . .”

66. Considerations similar to those which have prompted the recogni-
tion of the preferential rights of the coastal State in a special situation
apply when coastal populations in other fishing States are also dependent
on certain fishing grounds. In both instances the economic dependence
and the livelihood of whole communities are affected. Not only do the
same considerations apply, but the same interest in conservation exists.
In this respect the Applicant has recognized that the conservation and
efficient exploitation of the fish stocks in the Iceland area are of impor-
tance not only to Iceland but also to the United Kingdom.

67. The provisions of the Icelandic Regulations of 14 July 1972 and
the manner of their implementation disregard the fishing rights of the
Applicant. Iceland’s unilateral action thus constitutes an infringement of
the principle enshrined in Article 2 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on
the High Seas which requires that all States, including coastal States, in
exercising their freedom of fishing, pay reasonable regard to the interests
of other States. It also disregards the rights of the Applicant as they result
from the Exchange of Notes of 1961. The Applicant is therefore justified
in asking the Court to give all necessary protection to its own rights,
while at the same time agreeing to recognize Iceland’s preferential posi-
tion. Accordingly, the Court is bound to conclude that the Icelandic
Regulations of 14 July 1972 establishing a zone of exclusive fisheries
jurisdiction extending to 50 nautical miles from baselines around the coast
of Iceland, are not opposable to the United Kingdom, and the latter is
under no obligation to accept the unilateral termination by Iceland of
United Kingdom fishery rights in the area.


69. It follows from the reasoning of the Court in this case that in
order to reach an equitable solution of the present dispute it is necessary
that the preferential fishing rights of Iceland, as a State specially depen-
dent on coastal fisheries, be reconciled with the traditional fishing rights
of the Applicant. Such a reconciliation cannot be based, however, on a
phasing-out of the Applicant’s fishing, as was the case in the 1961 Ex-
change of Notes in respect of the 12-mile fishery zone. In that zone,
Iceland was to exercise exclusive fishery rights while not objecting to
continued fishing by the Applicant’s vessels during a phasing-out period.
In adjacent waters outside that zone, however, a similar extinction of
rights of other fishing States, particularly when such rights result from a
situation of economic dependence and long-term reliance on certain
fishing grounds, would not be compatible with the notion of preferential
rights as it was recognized at the Geneva Conferences of 1958 and 1960,
nor would it be equitable. At the 1960 Conference, the concept of prefer-
ential rights of coastal States in a special situation was recognized in the
joint amendment referred to in paragraph 57 above, under such limita-
tions and to such extent as is found ‘‘necessary by reason of the depen-
dence of the coastal State on the stock or stocks of fish, while having
regard to the interests of any other State or States in the exploitation of
such stock or stocks of fish”. The reference to the interests of other
States in the exploitation of the same stocks clearly indicates that the
preferential rights of the coastal State and the established rights of other
States were considered as, in principle, continuing to co-exist.

70. This is not to say that the preferential rights of a coastal State in a
special situation are a static concept, in the sense that the degree of the
coastal State’s preference is to be considered as fixed for ever at some
given moment. On the contrary, the preferential rights are a function of
the exceptional dependence of such a coastal State on the fisheries in
adjacent waters and may, therefore, vary as the extent of that dependence
changes. Furthermore, as was expressly recognized in the 1961 Exchange
of Notes, a coastal State’s exceptional dependence on fisheries may relate

.not only to the livelihood of its people but to its economic development.
In each case, it is essentially a matter of appraising the dependence of the
coastal State on the fisheries in question in relation to that of the other
State concerned and of reconciling them in as equitable a manner as is
possible.

71. In view of the Court’s finding (paragraph 67 above) that the
Icelandic Regulations of 14 July 1972 are not opposable to the United
Kingdom for the reasons which have been stated, it follows that the
Government of Iceland is not in law entitled unilaterally to exclude
United Kingdom fishing vessels from sea areas to seaward of the limits
agreed to in the 1961 Exchange of Notes or unilaterally to impose restric-
tions on their activities in such areas. But the matter does not end there;



as the Court has indicated, Iceland is, in view of its special situation,
entitled to preferential rights in respect of the fish stocks of the waters
adjacent to its coasts. Due recognition must be given to the rights of both
Parties, namely the rights of the United Kingdom to fish in the waters in
dispute, and the preferential rights of Iceland. Neither right is an absolute
one: the preferential rights of a coastal State are limited according to the
extent of its special dependence on the fisheries and by its obligation to
take account of the rights of other States and the needs of conservation;
the established rights of other fishing States are in turn limited by reason
of the coastal State’s special dependence on the fisheries and its own
obligation to take account of the rights of other States, including the
coastal State, and of the needs of conservation.

72. It follows that even if the Court holds that Iceland’s extension of
its fishery limits is not opposable to the Applicant, this does not mean
that the Applicant is under no obligation to [Iceland with respect to fishing
in the disputed waters in the 12-mile to 50-mile zone. On the contrary,
both States have an obligation to take full account of each others rights
and of any fishery conservation measures the necessity of which is shown
to exist in those waters. It is one of the advances in maritime international
law, resulting from the intensification of fishing, that the former laissez-
faire treatment of the living resources of the sea in the high seas has been
replaced by a recognition of a duty to have due regard to the rights of
other States and the needs of conservation for the benefit of all. Conse-
quently, both Parties have the obligation to keep under review the fishery
resources in the disputed waters and to examine together, in the light of
scientific and other available information, the measures required for the
conservation and development, and equitable exploitation, of those
resources, taking into account any international agreement in force
between them, such as the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention of
24 January 1959, as well as such other agreements as may be reached in
the matter in the course of further negotiation.

73. The most appropriate method for the solution of the dispute is
clearly that of negotiation. Its objective should be the delimitation of the
rights and interests of the Parties, the preferential rights of the coastal
State on the one hand and the rights of the Applicant on the other, to
balance and regulate equitably questions such as those of catch-limita-
tion, share allocations and “related restrictions concerning areas closed to
fishing, number and type of vessels allowed and forms of control of the
agreed provisions” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland),
Interim Measures, Order of 12 July 1973, 1.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 303,



para. 7). This necessitates detailed scientific knowledge of the fishing
grounds. It is obvious that the relevant information and expertise would
be mainly in the possession of the Parties. The Court would, for this
reason, meet with difficulties if it were itself to attempt to lay down a
precise scheme for an equitable adjustment of the rights involved. It is
thus obvious that both in regard to merits and to jurisdiction the Court
only pronounces on the case which is before it and not on any hypo-
thetical situation which might arise in the future.

74. It is implicit in the concept of preferential rights that negotiations
are required in order to define or delimit the extent of those rights, as
was already recognized in the 1958 Geneva Resolution on Special Situa-
tions relating to Coastal Fisheries, which constituted the starting point of
the law on the subject. This Resolution provides for the establishment,
through collaboration between the coastal State and any other State
fishing in the area, of agreed measures to secure just treatment of the
special situation.

75. The obligation to negotiate thus flows from the very nature of the
respective rights of the Parties; to direct them to negotiate is therefore a
proper exercise of the judicial function in this case. This also corresponds
to the Principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning peaceful settlement of disputes. As the Court stated in the
North Sea Continental Shelf cases:

ec

. this obligation merely constitutes a special application of a
principle which underlies all international relations, and which is
moreover recognized in Article 33 of the Charter of the United
Nations as one of the methods for the peaceful settlement of interna-
tional disputes” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 86).

76. In this case negotiations were initiated by the Parties from the date
when Iceland gave notice of its intention to extend its fisheries jurisdic-
tion, but these negotiations reached an early deadlock, and could not
come to any conclusion; subsequently, further negotiations were directed
to the conclusion of the interim agreement of 13 November 1973. The
obligation to seek a solution of the dispute by peaceful means, among
which negotiations are the most appropriate to this case, has not been
eliminated by that interim agreement. The question has been raised, how-
ever, on the basis of the deletion of a sentence which had been proposed
by the United Kingdom in the process of elaboration of the text, whether
the parties agreed to wait for the expiration of the term provided for in
the interim agreement without entering into further negotiations. The
deleted sentence, which would have appeared in paragraph 7 of the 1973
Exchange of Notes, read: “The Governments will reconsider the position
before that term expires unless they have in the meantime agreed to a
settlement of the substantive dispute.”

77. The Court cannot accept the view that the deletion of this sentence
which concerned renegotiation of the interim régime warrants the in-



ference that the common intention of the Parties was to be released from
negotiating in respect of the basic dispute over Iceland’s extension to a
50-mile limit throughout the whole period covered by the interim agree-
ment. Such an intention would not correspond to the attitude taken up
by the Applicant in these proceedings, in which it has asked the Court to
adjudge and declare that the Parties are under a duty to negotiate a ré-
gime for the fisheries in the area. Nor would an interpretation of this
kind, in relation to Iceland’s intention, correspond to the clearly stated
policy of the Icelandic authorities to continue negotiations on the basic
problems relating to the dispute, as emphasized by paragraph 3 of the
Althing Resolution of 15 February 1972, referred to earlier, which reads:
“That efforts to reach a solution of the problems connected with the
extension be continued through discussions with the Governments of the
United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany.” Taking into
account that the interim agreement contains a definite date for its expira-
tion, and in the light of what has been stated in paragraph 75 above, it
would seem difficult to attribute to the Parties an intention to wait for
that date and for the reactivation of the dispute, with all the possible
friction it might engender, before one of them might require the other to
attempt a peaceful settlement through negotiations. At the same time,
the Court must add that its Judgment obviously cannot preclude the
Parties from benefiting from any subsequent developments in the pertinent
rules of international law.

78. In the fresh negotiations which are to take place on the basis of the
present Judgment, the Parties will have the benefit of the above appraisal
of their respective rights, and of certain guidelines defining their scope.
The task before them will be to conduct their negotiations on the basis
that each must in good faith pay reasonable regard to the legal rights of
the other in the waters around Iceland outside the 12-mile limit, thus
bringing about an equitable apportionment of the fishing resources based
on the facts of the particular situation, and having regard to the interests
of other States which have established fishing rights in the area. Itis not a
matter of finding simply an equitable solution, but an equitable solution
derived from the applicable law. As the Court stated in the North Sea
Continental Shelf cases:


‘...1t is not a question of applying equity simply as a matter of
abstract justice, but of applying a rule of law which itself requires the
application of equitable principles” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para.
85).



FISHERIES JURISDICTION (JUDGMENT)

79. For these reasons,
THE COURT,

by ten votes to four,


@)

finds that the Regulations concerning the Fishery Limits off Iceland
(Reglugerd um fiskveidilandhelgi Islands) promulgated by the
Government of Iceland on 14 July 1972 and constituting a unilateral
extension of the exclusive fishing rights of Iceland to 50 nautical
miles from the baselines specified therein are not opposable to the
Government of the United Kingdom ;

finds that, in consequence, the Government of Iceland is not entitled
unilaterally to exclude United Kingdom fishing vessels from areas
between the fishery limits agreed to in the Exchange of Notes of
11 March 1961 and the limits specified in the Icelandic Regulations
of 14 July 1972, or unilaterally to impose restrictions on the activities
of those vessels in such areas;

by ten votes to four,

3)

(4)


holds that the Government of Iceland and the Government of the
United Kingdom are under mutual obligations to undertake negotia-
tions in good faith for the equitable solution of their differences
concerning their respective fishery rights in the areas specified in
subparagraph 2;

holds that in these negotiations the Parties are to take into account,
inter alia:

(a) that in the distribution of the fishing resources in the areas
specified in subparagraph 2 Iceland is entitled to a preferential
share to the extent of the special dependence of its people upon
the fisheries in the seas around its coasts for their livelihood and
economic development ;

(b) that by reason of its fishing activities in the areas specified in
subparagraph 2, the United Kingdom also has established rights
in the fishery resources of the said areas on which elements of
its people depend for their livelihood and economic well-being;

(c) the obligation to pay due regard to the interests of other States
in the conservation and equitable exploitation of these resources;
{d) that the above-mentioned rights of Iceland and of the United
Kingdom should each be given effect to the extent compatible
with the conservation and development of the fishery resources
in the areas specified in subparagraph 2 and with the interests
of other States in their conservation and equitable exploitation;

(e) their obligation to keep under review those resources and to
examine together, in the light of scientific and other available
information, such measures as may be required for the conser-


vation and development, and equitable exploitation, of those
resources, making use of the machinery established by the
North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention or such other means
as may be agreed upon as a result of international negotiations,
