   Analysis by the Court — Legal status of MOU under international
law — Signing of MOU and registration with United Nations Secretar-
iat — MOU a written document recording Parties’ agreement on certain
points governed by international law — Provision addressing entry into
force indicative of instrument’s binding character — Somali Minister for
National Planning duly authorized as signatory — MOU to enter into force
upon signature — No ratification requirement in MOU — MOU is a valid
treaty that entered into force upon signature and is binding on Parties under
international law.

   Interpretation of MOU — Rules of interpretation in Articles 31 and 32
of Vienna Convention — Ordinary meaning, context and object and pur-
pose to be considered as a whole — Role of CLCS in process of delineation
of outer limits of continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles — Distinction
between delineation and delimitation.

   Title of MOU — Meaning of individual paragraphs — Title and first five
paragraphs indicative of a purpose — MOU a no-objection agreement
enabling CLCS to make recommendations despite existence of a dispute —
Whether sixth paragraph of MOU contains agreed dispute settlement
method — Sixth paragraph relating only to continental shelf — Delineation
of outer limits of continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles without preju-
dice to maritime boundary delimitation — Similarity in language between
Article 83, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS and sixth paragraph of MOU —
Sixth paragraph did not prevent Parties from engaging in negotiations in
good faith to reach agreement — No temporal restriction contained in
sixth paragraph in that regard — Sixth paragraph not prescribing a method
of dispute settlement — Parties did not consider themselves bound to wait
for CLCS recommendations before engaging in negotiations — Interpreta-
tion confirmed by travaux préparatoires and circumstances in which MOU
was concluded — Initiative of Special Representative of UN Secretary-
General for Somalia — Assistance provided by Norway — Conclusion
that MOU not an agreement “to have recourse to some other method or
methods of settlement” within meaning of Kenya’s reservation to its optional
clause declaration — Kenya’s reservation not applicable.

  Whether Part XV (“Settlement of Disputes”) of UNCLOS amounted to
agreement on a method of settlement of maritime boundary dispute within
meaning of Kenya’s reservation — Structure and provisions of Part XV —
Article 282 — Ordinary meaning of Article 282 encompasses agreement to


6                    maritime delimitation (judgment)

Court’s jurisdiction resulting from optional clause declarations — Interpre-
tation confirmed by travaux préparatoires — Procedure before the Court
to apply “in lieu” of procedures under Section 2 of Part XV — Part XV
does not provide for “other method” of dispute settlement within meaning of
Kenya’s reservation — Finding that the Court has jurisdiction gives effect to
intent reflected in Kenya’s declaration — Present case does not, by virtue of
Part XV, fall outside scope of Parties’ consent to the Court’s jurisdiction.

  Conclusion that neither MOU nor Part XV of UNCLOS within scope of
Kenya’s reservation to its optional clause declaration — Kenya’s prelimi-
nary objection to jurisdiction rejected.
