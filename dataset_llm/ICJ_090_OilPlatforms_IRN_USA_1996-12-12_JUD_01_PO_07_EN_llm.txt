1. To my great regret I find myself dissenting from the Court’s Judg-
ment on account of my belief that the Court should have upheld the pre-
liminary objection concerning the Court’s jurisdiction as raised by the
United States, and should have declined to entertain the Application filed
by Iran.

3. By way of an introduction to my opinion, I wonder if there was in
fact any dispute between Iran and the United States prior to the filing of
the Application of Iran with respect to the “interpretation or applica-
tion” of the 1955 Treaty. As far as the record before the Court shows,
there was no diplomatic negotiation between the two countries on this
subject before Iran filed the Application in November 1992. Certainly, in
the written and oral proceedings which followed on from the Applica-
tion, Iran expressed its views on various articles (i.e., Articles I, IV (1)
and X (1)) of that Treaty and, in response, the United States presented
different views. But this surely does not mean that there was previously
any dispute between Iran and the United States as to the “interpretation



or application” of the 1955 Treaty, such as to be submitted to this Court.
I believe, even if only for that simple reason, that the Iranian Application
in the present case could have been dismissed.

5. There is no doubt whatever that the consent of sovereign States to
be subject to the Court’s jurisdiction is a cornerstone of international jus-
tice. As is pointed out in the recent jurisprudence of the Court, “one of
the fundamental principles of the Statute is that the Court cannot decide
a dispute between States without the consent of those States to its juris-
diction” (East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
1995, p. 101; see also the precedents of the Court referred to therein).
According to its Statute, the Court may be seised of legal disputes in
three different ways: namely, (i) by joint referral of disputes to the Court
(Art. 36 (1)), (ii) by seising the Court under the optional clause whereby
the States may declare that they recognize as compulsory the jurisdiction
of the Court (Art. 36 (2)), and (iii) by the referral of disputes in accord-
ance with treaty provisions (Art. 36 (1)). The fact that the Court’s juris-
diction in a case of unilateral application is restricted to the latter two
instances (in other words, (ii) and (iii)) remains as a reflection of the basic
principle that the consent of the sovereign State is required for the exer-
cise of the Court’s jurisdiction, as in these cases the respondent States are
deemed to have given such consent in advance in general terms by means
of the optional clause of the Statute or by the insertion of a compromis-
sory clause into treaties. Without the consent, whether individual or gen-



eral, of the States concerned, there will be no legal dispute which can be
adjudicated by the Court.

9. It is noted in the history of the Court that most cases of unilateral
application were related to disputes which arose between those States
which had accepted the Court’s jurisdiction under the optional clause, as
referred to above. In some of those cases, the disputes came to the merits
phase of the Court’s proceedings without occasioning any objection by
the respondent State and were finally settled by a Judgment of the Court.
While there were four cases in the first 30-year period of the Court, the
only two cases of this type with which the Court dealt during the past
20 years are: Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (I.C.J. Reports 1991, p. 53)
and Maritime Delimitation in the Area between Greenland and
Jan Mayen (I.C.J. Reports 1993, p. 38). However, in a number of cases
of unilateral application on the basis of the optional clause of the Court’s
Statute, preliminary objections to the Court’s jurisdiction were raised by
the respondent States on account of their interpretations of the ways in
which that clause had been applied. In some cases, the Court dismissed
such objections, so that the cases in question came to the merits phase.
The case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against
Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (LC.J. Reports
1986, p. 14) is the only one of this type with which the Court has dealt in
the course of the past 20 years. Alternatively, the Court could uphold the



objections on the ground of the application of the optional clause, thus
bringing the case to an end. There has, in fact, been no case of this kind
dealt with by this Court in this past 20-year period.

the Court is to determine whether the real dispute between Iran and the
United States that has arisen as a result of the latter’s attack on and
destruction of the Iranian oil platforms in a chain of events that took
place during the use of force by both sides in the Iran-Iraq War is, as Iran
alleges and the Court concludes, a dispute as to the “interpretation or
application” of the Treaty within the meaning of its Article XXI (2). In
my view, this is certainly not the case.

22. Assuming that the attack on the platforms or their destruction (or



the use of armed force in general) had become a subject of diplomatic
negotiations between Iran and the United States which had failed, that
attack could not be seen as falling within the scope of the 1955 Treaty for
reasons which counsel for the United States called “a lack of a reasonable
connection” and, as I see it, is by its very nature irrelevant to the scope of
the Treaty. The United States had certainly not intended (and no State
may be prepared to intend) to confer jurisdiction upon the Court to deal
with such a dispute simply by having concluded such a treaty. The Court
is at present required to ascertain whether the particular action of the
United States was of the kind which really fell within the scope of the
Treaty, or, more particularly, affected the legal interests (rights and
duties) of Iran which were meant to have been protected under the 1955
Treaty.

23. In my view, Iran is not competent to refer to the Court unilater-
ally, by invoking the compromissory clause in that Treaty, a dispute
going beyond the interpretation or application of the provisions of the
bilateral 1955 Treaty of Amity and turning upon the scope of the Treaty.
Certainly a dispute created by the destruction by the United States’
armed forces of the Iranian oil platforms can be subjected to the Court’s
jurisdiction by other means, i.e., by a joint submission {a special agree-
ment) or, by the application of the rule of forum prorogatum in the event
that the United States should subsequently agree to accept the Court’s
jurisdiction. In fact the United States has raised an objection to the
Court’s jurisdiction in respect of the Iranian Application.

24. While rejecting Article I of the Treaty of Amity as “a basis for the
jurisdiction of the Court” (Judgment, para. 31) and Article IV (1) as “the
basis for the Court’s jurisdiction” (ibid., para. 36), the Court holds the
view that “[the] lawfulness [of the destruction of the Iranian oil
platforms] can be evaluated in relation to [Article X (1)]” (ibid., para. 51)
and

“[i]n the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there exists
between the Parties a dispute as to the interpretation and the appli-
cation of Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of 1955; that this
dispute falls within the scope of the compromissory clause in
Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the Treaty; and that as a consequence
the Court has jurisdiction to entertain this dispute” (ibid., para. 53).

Iran has brought the present case to the Court in the hope that the Court
will find that the United States had breached several obligations under
the 1955 Treaty and international law, and has contended that “the
Court has jurisdiction under the Treaty of Amity to entertain the dispute”
(Application of Iran, p. 12; emphasis added). The Court now responds
that “it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the
Treaty of 1955, to entertain the claims made by the Islamic Republic of



Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of that Treaty” (Judgment, dispositif,
para. 2; emphasis added).

25. The way in which the Court responds to the Iranian Application in
this Judgment derives from a misconception. The Court was requested by
Iran to adjudge at this stage that it has jurisdiction under the Treaty to
entertain the dispute occasioned by the destruction of the platforms by
the United States force, but not to entertain any claims made by Iran
under any specific article — in this case Article X (1). In my view the
conclusion reached by the Court is unjustified because the Court should
not have interpreted each provision of Articles I, IV (1) and X (1) as pro-
viding a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court but should rather have
determined that a dispute — if any such exists — between Iran and the
United States arising from the attack on and destruction of the Iranian
oil platforms falls within the purview of the 1955 Treaty of Amity.
