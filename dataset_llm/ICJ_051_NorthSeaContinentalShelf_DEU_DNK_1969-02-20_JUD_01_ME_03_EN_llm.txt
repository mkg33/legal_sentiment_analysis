I concur in the Judgment of the Court and especially in its conclusion
that the equidistance method or principle is not established as obligatory
in international law. It would be possible to emphasize by more detailed
quotations how crystal clear it is that neither the International Law
Commission nor its Committee of Experts considered that ““equidistance™
was prescribed by existing law or that it was a concept inherent in the
very nature of the continental shelf.

In my opinion, more extended discussion than is to be found in the
Judgment of the Court may usefully be devoted to what, in the words of
Counsel for Denmark and the Netherlands, are “some of the realities
of the ‘just and equitable share’ in the present cases”. At the same time,
I agree with the Court that the contentions of the Federal Republic in
favour of this concept cannot be accepted in the form given to them.

As the Memorial (in Chapter | of Part H) begins to develop the legal
theory of “the just and equitable share”, there is clear reference to natural
resources (sections 29 and 30). The emphasis on resources is strengthened
in sections 34 and 35 especially by the invocation of the law on the ap-

up a supply base for establishing a drilling station or for the landing
of the extracted product.”

As the Memorial proceeds to develop the argument about “special
circumstances”, there are references and quotations to the effect that the
location of “indivisible deposits of mineral oil or natural gas” may con-
stitute such circumstances (section 70). These references are repeated in
section 79, where it is said that—

“the literature on the subject attributes relevance also to historical,
economic, and technical factors, in particular to the geographical
distribution of the mineral resources of the continental shelf and to
the maintenance of the unity of their deposits™ !.

mary importance. However, in the following section, the Memorial, in
arguing for the “principle of equality”, asserts that all the coastal States
of the North Sea are interested, inter alia, “in the appropriate exploitation
of the mineral deposits of the scabed in order to avoid wasteful or harm-
ful methods of extraction which would lead to despoliation”. Here
reference is made to the Supplementary Agreement of 14 May 1962 to
the German-Netherlands Ems-Dollard Treaty of 8 April 1960, which
provides for joint exploitation and sharing of costs and profits in the
Ems Estuary 2.

Finally the Memorial, in section 95, at least hints that the Court would
be free to indicate that the location of mineral resources may be one of
the criteria to be taken into account “in order to achieve a just and equi-
table apportionment’.

in section 66 of the German Memorial to the effect that the important
coastal point must be one useful in connection with drillings and extrac-
tions of minerals. The Counter-Memorial states that—

“experience shows that, if a deposit is exploited, the nearest points
on the coast, even if theretofore unused or scarcely inhabited, may
be developed into important elements of support for the exploita-
tion...”

—N.A.M.) in the North Sea since 1956. Since 1960 “‘these activities have
been especially concentrated on the northern part and up to the median
lines which separate the Netherlands part from the German and Danish
parts of the shelf”. Between August 1962 and 1966, a total of 24 licences
had been granted to about 19 companies or groups of companies repre-
senting American, Belgian, British, French, German and Italian interests;
these licences ‘cover all of that part of the continental shelf which comes
under the jurisdiction of the Netherlands on the basis of the equidistance
principle”.

6 October 1965 concerning the exploitation of a single geological structure, is not
mentioned.



Counter-Memorial shows the charting of the blocks for which licences
are granted.

further developed, it is stated that—

“there is no necessary connection between the surface of an area
and the amount of exploitable resources therein. ... Indeed the
total amount of the natural resources of the area, indicated as the
continental shelf beneath the North Sea, is unknown and the same
goes for the location of those resources.”

the use of waters of international rivers, there is the following statement
which is not lacking in significance:

“Surely it is possible that a single geological structure extends
across a boundary line on the continental shelf, as it is possible
that a single geological structure extends across the delimitation
lines between concession areas on the part of the continental shelf
appertaining to one State. Both municipal legislations and the inter-
national practice of States show that the problems arising from such
a situation are not solved by a modification of the boundaries of the
concession area or of the continental shelf as the case may be, but
by different methods which do not affect those boundaries. In this
connection reference is made to paragraph 18 of the Netherlands
Counter-Memorial . . .”

In the oral proceedings, there are a number of statements which are
of interest in considering whether the known or probable location of
mineral resources is a key factor.

From the side of the Federal Republic, its Agent, in his opening
address on 23 October stated flatly:

“The main consideration that influences State practice in the acqui-
sition and delimitation of continental shelf areas is the idea of getting
a share in the potentialities of the continental shelf that have accrued
to the coastal States by the progress of modern technology.”

All of these various but often ambivalent references to the natural
resources of the shelf, considered in the light of the German argument
for a “just and equitable share”, led one Member of the Court to put
the following question to the Agent of the Federal Republic on 25
October:

“Will the Agent of the Federal Republic of Germany, at a con-
venient time, inform the Court whether it is the contention of the
Federal Republic of Germany that the actual or probable location
of known or potential resources on or in the continental shelf,
is one of the criteria to be taken into account in determining what
is a ‘just and equitable share’ of the continental shelf in the North
Sea?”

The German Agent replied to this question on 4 November in the
following terms:

“In response to this question I would like to state the following:
First, the criteria to be taken into account in determining what


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. JESSUP)

is a just and equitable share of the continental shelf are primarily,
but not exclusively, geographical factors. The consideration of other
factors and the weight which should be attributed to them depends
on their merits under the circumstances of the concrete case.

Secondly, if, as in the North Sea, there is no reliable information
about the actual location of economically exploitable resources of
considerable importance, the geographical situation alone determines
the equitable apportionment. Once agreement had been reached on
the delimitation of the continental shelf, later knowledge as to the
location of such resources should not affect the agreed boundary.

Thirdly, economically exploitable resources of considerable impor-
tance, located in areas where the boundary is disputed or yet undeter-
mined may, under the principle of the just and equitable share, be
taken into account in determining the allocation of areas to one or the
other State. This may be accomplished either by changing the course
of the boundary line, or by means of joint exploitation if the latter is
feasible. Such a case may arise in particular if the boundary line would
cut across a single deposit. Since there are no such resources in the
North Sea, the delimitation of the continental shelf should be made
on the basis of the geographical situation, along the lines suggested
by the Federal Republic of Germany. (Emphasis supplied).

In this context, I may add that the simplest way to have achieved
an equitable apportionment with respect to known or unknown
resources would have been to place the areas of the continental
shelf of the North Sea situated farther off the coast under a régime
of joint control and exploitation. The Federal Republic had advo-
cated such a solution in the earlier stages of the negotiations: since
the North Sea States had begun to divide the continental shelf
among themselves by boundaries, such a situation seems to be out-
side the realm of reality. In the present situation, a division by
sectors reaching the centre of the North Sea is an effective way to
give the Parties an even chance with respect to the potentialities
of the continental shelf.”

Tt is difficult to reconcile the statement that “‘there are no such resources



“If there are several States adjacent to the same continental shelf,
this transfer of jurisdiction [to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
coastal States] involves a partitioning, among those States, of area,
and the potential resources therein, which have accrued to the coastal
State from the common fund of mankind. The making of such an
apportionment implies that the self-evident principle of the just
and equitable share must be given effect. The necessary criteria
will have to be developed from the concept of the continental shelf
and adapted to the situation of the particular case.” (Emphasis
supplied.)


On the other side, argument for Denmark and the Netherlands did
not fail to take account of the realities of the location of resources of
oil and gas. On 28 October, the Agent for Denmark made the following
statement :

“At the same time the Danish Government must consider this
case as being of the utmost importance. Denmark has so far had no
natural resources or riches. In the modern search for oil and gas



extensive exploration has taken place without positive results, apart
from the fact that not very far north of the boundary line in question
oil and gas have been found. Even if it is not yet known whether
commercial exploitation is possible, the position of the boundary
line must be considered as being of the utmost importance.”

On the last day of the oral proceedings, 11 November, Counsel for
Denmark and the Netherlands, in the course of a somewhat satirical
discussion of what he called the ‘“‘macrogeographical” approach, made
a somewhat detailed comparison of the economic and particularly of
the mineral resources of the three States parties to the case. He noted
that the Federal Republic ‘‘has been rich in mineral and fuel” whereas,
“until recently, the Netherlands had quite minor mineral and fuel
resources’. Denmark, in turn, “in the past had altogether negligible
mineral and fuel resources”. He continued to note that the Netherlands
in recent years has uncovered ‘‘important sources of natural gas and



some crude oil” !. As for Denmark, its economic position—

“might be transformed if oil or natural gas now became available
to her in the continental shelf. In this connection the Court was
informed, in Chapter I of Part I, and in Annex 7 of the Danish
Counter-Memorial, that the quite extensive exploration already
carried out indicates that the only areas of promise so far discovered
lie just to the north, on the Danish side, of the Danish equidistance
boundary. In short, the stretching of the Federal Republic’s conti-
nental shelf to the so-called centre of the North Sea in the manner
demanded by our opponents may well have the result of cutting
off Denmark from the one reasonable expectation which she has
of acquiring appreciable domestic sources of energy.”

All of these observations, Counsel informed the Court, were presented
“only to indicate some of the realities of the ‘just and equitable share’
in the present cases”. Finally, he was more dogmatic in asserting that
the German Agent's reply to the question from a Member of the Court
constituted an agreement that the Court has only to consider “‘geographi-
cal factors”; in other words he was maintaining that despite his own
observations on relative wealth of the three States in mineral fuel resour-
ces, the Court was not called upon to take such resources in the continental
shelf into account if it sought to determine what is a ‘just and equitable
share”.

lands are to be treated as null and void ab initio. Rather, 1 think there
should be applied the following conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal
which, in the Grishadarna case, on 23 October 1909, decided the delimita-
tion of a certain part of the maritime frontier between Norway and
Sweden:

““... in the law of nations, it is a well established principle that it is
necessary to refrain as far as possible from modifying the state of



things existing in fact and for a long time; . . . that principle has a
very particular application when private interests are in question,
which, once disregarded, can not be preserved in an effective manner
even by any sacrifices of the State, to which those interested be-
long . . .” (Wilson, The Hague Arbitration Cases, 1915, pp. 11, 129).


Of the existing North Sea agreements relating to joint exploitation
and mentioned in paragraph 97 of the Judgment of the Court, that be-
tween the Netherlands and the Federal Republic applying to the Ems
Estuary is, as already noted, the most complete example of full co-
operation in both exploitation and profit-sharing. The Agreement of
6 October 1965 between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom calls
for consultation on the most effective exploitation of overlapping de-
posits and on “the manner in which the costs and proceeds relating there-
to shall be apportioned”. If the two Governments fail to reach agreement,
the matter is to be referred, at the request of either one, to an arbitrator
whose decision is binding. If licensees are involved, their proposals are
to be considered by the Governments. The other agreements in general
call for consultation with a view to agreement; in the United Kingdom-

Therefore, while, as the Court states, the principle of joint exploitation
is particularly appropriate in cases involving the principle of the unity
of a deposit, it may have a wider application in agreements reached by
the Parties concerning the still undelimited but potentially overlapping
areas of the continental shelf which have been in dispute.

I am quite cognizant of the fact that the general economy of the Court's
Judgment did not conduce to the inclusion of the detailed. and largely
factual, analysis which I have considered it appropriate to set forth in
this separate opinion, but I believe that what is stated here, even if it is
not considered to reveal an emerging rule of international law, may at
least be regarded as an elaboration of the factors to be taken into ac-
count in the negotiations now to be undertaken by the Parties. Beyond



that, I hope it may contribute to further understanding of the principles
of equity which, in the words of Judge Manley O. Hudson, are “part of
the international law which it [the Court] must apply”. (Diversion of
Water from the Meuse, P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 70, 1937, p. 77.)

I wish to state also that I associate myself with the points made in the
Declaration of Judge Sir Muhammad Zafruila Khan.

Difficult as the problems are, it is fortunate that the three States which
confront them are expressly committed to various methods of amicable
settlement. They are aware of their right, under Article 60 of the Statute,
to return to this Court for further guidance, or they may, if the need
should arise, resort to the procedures of arbitration and conciliation
set forth in the treaties of 1926 which are cited in the Special Agreements
of 2 February 1967.
