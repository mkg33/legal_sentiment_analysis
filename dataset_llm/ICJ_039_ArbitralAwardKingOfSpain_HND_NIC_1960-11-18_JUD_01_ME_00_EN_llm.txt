the task.

On 4 October 1904, the Spanish Minister sent telegrams to the
Presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua stating that it had been
agreed to designate the King of Spain as arbitrator in the case.

On 6 October 1904, the President of Honduras expressed his
satisfaction at the designation of the King of Spain to decide the
question of boundaries of Honduras and Nicaragua, and expressed
the hope that the King would accept the task.

On 7 October 1904, the President of Nicaragua replied that it
would “be satisfactory and an honour for Nicaragua if H.M. the
King of Spain will accept the designation of arbitrator to settle the
boundaries dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua”.

On 17 October 1904, the acceptance of the King of Spain was
communicated to the Spanish Minister in Central America, who
immediately dispatched telegrams to the Presidents of Honduras
and Nicaragua informing them of the King’s agreement ‘to be the



arbitrator in the question of the boundaries between Nicaragua and
Honduras”.

In his Note of 21 December 1904, addressed to the Spanish
Minister of State, the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua renewed in
the name of his Government “to His Majesty the King of Spain the
expression of my deep gratitude for the generosity shown’ in
accepting his “designation as arbitrator to settle the question of
boundaries between Nicaragua and Honduras”.

In his Report to the National Legislative Assembly dated 30
November 1905, the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua stated:

“At a meeting in Guatemala City in October 1904, under the
presidency of His Excellency the Minister for Spain to Central
America, the moment came to elect the third arbitrator who is
to settle the affair definitively. His Majesty King Alfonso XIII
of Spain was elected as the third arbitrator, the two arbitrators
voting in favour, and no choice could have been more appropriate.
The affair is now brought to the august cognizance of His Catholic
Majesty, who has already appointed a commission of investigation
made up of distinguished persons.

I have already declared in the chapter referring to Honduras that
His Majesty King Alfonso XIII is the arbitrator who is to settle
our boundary question; I am glad to add that the August Sovereign
of the Mother Country has generously informed the Nicaraguan
Government, through his Minister of State, that he feels it a very
great pleasure to have been appointed to settle the question pending
between these two American Republics, for which he has a warm
sympathy. For this we are very grateful to the Spanish Monarch and
his enlightened Government.”

No question was at any time raised in the arbitral proceedings
before the King with regard either to the validity of his designation
as arbitrator or his jurisdiction as such. Before him, the Parties
followed the procedure that had been agreed upon for submitting
their respective cases. Indeed, the very first occasion when the
validity of the designation of the King of Spain as arbitrator
was challenged was in the Note of the Foreign Minister of Nicara-
gua of 19 March 1912.

In these circumstances the Court is unable to hold that the desig-
nation of the King of Spain as arbitrator to decide the boundary
dispute between the two Parties was invalid.

In support of its second contention, namely, that the Gémez-
Bonilla Treaty had lapsed before the King of Spain agreed to act
as arbitrator, Nicaragua argues that the Treaty came into effect
on 7 October 1894, the date on which it was signed, and that, by



virtue of Article XI, it lapsed ten years later, on 7 October 1904. As
the King of Spain agreed to act as arbitrator on 17 October 1904,
his designation as arbitrator took effect ten days after the Treaty
had, according to Nicaragua, ceased to be in force. On this view of
the matter, it is contended that the whole proceeding before the
King of Spain as arbitrator and his decision of 23 December 1906
was null and void and of no effect whatever. The reply of Honduras
is that the Treaty did not come into effect till the exchange of rati-
fications between the Parties, which was effected on 24 December
1896, and that consequently the period of ten years laid down in
Article XI of the Treaty expired on 24 December 1906. According
to Honduras, therefore, the arbitral proceedings were completed,
and the Award was handed down, during the currency of the Treaty.

It is argued on behalf of Nicaragua that Article IX of the Treaty,
which provided that the requirements laid down in Article VIII
with regard to ratifications and the exchange thereof should not
hinder the immediate organization of the Mixed Commission, meant
that the period of time specified in Article XI commenced to run,
not as from the date of the exchange of ratifications, but as from
the date of signature of the Treaty. Honduras, on the other hand,
relies upon Article IX as making provision for an exception to
the coming into effect of the Treaty, which was to await the
exchange of ratifications, the object of the exception being that
the organization of the Mixed Commission need not be delayed
pending the coming into force of the Treaty on the date of the
exchange of ratifications.

There is no express provision in the Treaty with regard to the
date on which it was to come into force. Taking into consideration
the provisions of Articles VIII, IX and X, the Court is of the view
that the intention of the Parties was that the Treaty should come
into force on the date of exchange of ratifications and that the
ten-year period specified in Article XI should begin to run from
that date but that, in the meantime, in pursuance of Article IX,
the immediate organization of the Mixed Commission might be
proceeded with. That this was the intention of the Parties is put
beyond doubt by the action taken by the two Parties by agreement
in respect of the designation of the King of Spain as arbitrator.
Agreement on the designation of the King of Spain as arbitrator was
reached on 2 October 1904. The Court finds it difficult to believe
that the Parties, or one of them, had in mind an interpretation of
the Treaty according to which the period provided for in Article XI
should expire five days later and that the Treaty should then lapse.
Indeed, on the very day on which, according to the present sub-
mission of Nicaragua, the Treaty expired, the President of Nica-
ragua stated in his telegram to the Spanish Minister to Central
America that it would be satisfactory and an honour for Nicaragua
if the King of Spain would accept his designation as arbitrator to
settle the boundary dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua. This



furnishes a clear indication that Nicaragua did not regard the Treaty
as having lapsed on that day.

Some support for Nicaragua's contention was sought to be drawn
from the suggestion made by the Spanish Minister to Central
America to the President of Honduras on 21 October 1904 and to
the President of Nicaragua on 24 October 1904 that the period of
the Treaty might be extended. In the opinion of the Court, the time
at which this initiative was taken shows that it did not carry with
it any implication that the Treaty had expired on 7 October 1904.
In actual fact, no action was taken to extend the duration of the
Treaty. This furnishes confirmation of the view which the Court
takes that the Treaty was not due to expire till ten years after the
date of the exchange of ratifications, that is to say, on 24 December
1906. Had this not been so, the two Governments, when confronted
with the suggestion made by the Spanish Minister to Central
America, would either have taken immediate appropriate measures
for the renewal or extension of the Treaty or would have terminated
all further proceedings in respect of the arbitration on the ground
that the Treaty providing for arbitration had already lapsed. On
the contrary, the two Governments proceeded with the arbitration
and submitted their respective cases to the arbitrator. This shows
that the intention of the Parties had been that the Treaty should
come into force on the date of the exchange of ratifications.

Again, it may be noted that no objection was taken before the
King of Spain to his proceeding with the arbitration on the ground
that the Gâmez-Bonilla Treaty had already expired. Indeed, the
very first allegation that the Treaty had expired on 7 October 1904
was made as late as 1920 during a mediation procedure undertaken
by the Government of the United States of America in an effort to
resolve the boundary dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua.

The Court, therefore, concludes that the Gdmez-Bonilla Treatv
was in force till 24 December 1906, and that the King’s acceptance
on 17 October 1904 of his designation as arbitrator was well within
the currency of the Treaty.

Pa

Finally, the Court considers that, having regard to the fact
that the designation of the King of Spain as arbitrator was freely
agreed to by Nicaragua, that no objection was taken by Nicaragua
to the jurisdiction of the King of Spain as arbitrator either on the
ground of irregularity in his designation as arbitrator or on the
ground that the Gâmez-Bonilla Treaty had lapsed even before the
King of Spain had signified his acceptance of the office of arbitrator,
and that Nicaragua fully participated in the arbitral proceedings
before the King, it is no longer open to Nicaragua to rely on either
of these contentions as furnishing a ground for the nullity of the
Award.




In a Note dated 9 January 1907, addressed to the Spanish
Chargé d’affaires in Central America, the Foreign Minister of
Nicaragua expressed the appreciation of his Government “for the
graciousness of the King of Spain who, by his arbitral award, has
terminated our frontier dispute with the neighbouring state of
Honduras”.

On 28 January 1907, the full text of the Award was published
in the Official Gazette of Nicaragua.

On 1 December 1907, the President of Nicaragua, in his message
to the National Legislative Assembly of Nicaragua, stated as
follows:

“On 23 December 1906, His Majesty the King of Spain made
the Arbitral Award in the matter of the delimitation of the frontier
between this Republic and that of Honduras. My Government has
noted with satisfaction that this important dispute has been termi-
nated by the highly civilized method of arbitration and, although
it accepts this decision with pleasure, it has given instructions
to Minister Crisanto Medina with a view to requesting a relevant
clarification since this decision contains some points that are
obscure and even contradictory.”

In the course of his report (Memoria) to the National Legislative
Assembly of Nicaragua, dated 26 December 1907, covering the
period between 1 December 1905 and 30 November 1907, the
Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, José Dolores Gâmez, referring to
Honduras, stated: “Our long-standing question of boundaries with
this sister Republic, which, as you will remember, we had sub-
mitted to arbitration by the King of Spain, was finally settled
by the latter on 23 December 1906, on which date he made his
Award.” He went on to explain that, despite every effort that had
been made by the Government of Nicaragua to obtain a more
favourable decision, the decision was somewhat disappointing. The
report continued: “The Award in question also contains contra-
dictory concepts which make it difficult to put it into effect, for
which reason our Minister in Spain has been instructed to ask for
a clarification to avoid possible difficulties in the interpretation of
these concepts by the parties interested in the case.” The report
then stated that, if satisfactory light was not thrown by the King
upon the points submitted to him, a friendly approach would be
made to the Government of Honduras so that “these final details”
might be settled in all harmony and to the satisfaction of both
countries. The report affirmed “that the irksome question of
frontiers which has preoccupied us for so many years and which
might at any moment have impaired the good relations which
have always attached us to our Honduran brothers, has been
settled. Boundary questions are normally of a very serious and
dangerous character, and as a rule they leave in their wake feelings
of deep resentment which are difficult to overcome. For that
reason we must rejoice at the friendly solution we have been able



to find in the settlement of so delicate a question, whatever lines
of demarcation have today been laid down for our frontiers with
Honduras.” In conclusion the report sounded a note of caution
for the future with regard to the seeking of settlements by arbitra-
tion without appeal.

The section of the report dealing with Spain set out the Award
in full.

The National Legislative Assembly of Nicaragua took note of
the report and by decree of 14 January 1go8 approved “the acts
of the executive power in the field of foreign affairs between:
I December 1905 and 26 December 1907”.

On 25 April 1911, the Foreign Minister of Honduras addressed
a Note to the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua pointing out that

“it would be desirable to demarcate the small portion of the
line which, in conformity with the last paragraph of the Arbitral
Award, extends from the junction of the River Poteca or Bodega
with the River Guineo or Namasli as far as the Portillo de Teote-
cacinte, since the Arbitral Award fixed the rest of the line along
natural boundaries; for this purpose, as soon as the time is thought
opportune, my Government will approach Your Excellencv’s
Government with a view to carrving out this demarcation bv agree-
ment.”

Early in September 1911, certain Nicaraguan papers carried a
report attributed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua
that one of its representatives, who was then in Europe, had been
instructed to request the King of Spain for a clarification of the
Award. The Honduran Chargé d’affaires in Nicaragua thereupon
approached the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua and enquired
whether the newspaper report was accurate. According to the Note
of the Honduran Chargé d’affaires dated 8 September 1911, address-
ed to his own Foreign Minister, a document presented to the Court
by Nicaragua, the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua replied that the
press reports were not true and

“that all that he had intimated to the journalists was that,
together with the Chargé d’affaires, he was engaged in examining
whatever had any reference to fixing, in accordance with the Award,
the line of demarcation running from the junction of the Poteca
or Bodega River as far as the Portillo de Teotecacinte ; and that
everything would be done in a satisfactory manner in view of the
sincere and cordial relations existing between the Governments
of Honduras and Nicaragua.”

It follows from the facts referred to above that Nicaragua took
cognizance of the Award and on several occasions between the
date of the Award and 1g March 1912 expressed its satisfaction to
Honduras that the dispute concerning the delimitation of frontiers



between the two countries had been finally settled through the

In the judgment of the Court, Nicaragua, by express declaration
and by conduct, recognized the Award as valid and it is no longer
open to Nicaragua to go back upon that recognition and to challenge
the validity of the Award. Nicaragua’s failure to raise any question
with regard to the validity of the Award for several years after the
full terms of the Award had become known to it further confirms
the conclusion at which the Court has arrived. The attitude of the
Nicaraguan authorities during that period was in conformity with
Article VII of the Gâmez-Bonilla Treaty which provided that the
arbitral decision whatever it might be—and this, in the view of the
Court, includes the decision of the King of Spain as arbitrator—



“shall be held as a perfect, binding and perpetual Treaty between
the High Contracting Parties, and shall not be subject to appeal”.

Nicaragua, however, contends that having in Appendix B
of the Washington Agreement of 21 July 1957 made the reservation
that, “when it appears before the International Court of Justice,
it will answer the claim of Honduras, presenting reasons, actions
and facts, and opposing the exceptions that it considers appropriate,
in order to impugn the validity of the Arbitral Award of 23 Decem-
ber 1906, and its compulsory force, and also invoking all those rights
that may be in its interest”, it is entitled to ask the Court for a
decision on the grounds of nullity put forward by it against the
Award. The reply of Honduras to this contention is that the effect
of Appendix A and Appendix B to the Washington Agreement was
no more than toleave it open to the Parties to present their respective
cases to the Court in any manner permissible to them under
international law and the Statute and Rules of Court, that Nica-
ragua was free to submit to the Court any grounds on which it
placed reliance in order to establish the nullity of the Award but
that it was equally open to Honduras to submit that, having regard
to the conduct and attitudes of Nicaragua, the Court was not called
upon to pronounce on all or some of those grounds. The Court is
inclined to the view that the Honduran contention is well-founded.

However, even if there had not been repeated acts of recognition
by Nicaragua which, as the Court has found, debars it from relying
subsequently on complaints of nullity and even if such complaints
had been put forward in proper time, the Award would, in the
judgment of the Court, still have to be recognized as valid. The
Court will proceed to indicate very briefly the reasons for arriving
at this conclusion. Before doing so, the Court will observe that the
Award is not subject to appeal and that the Court cannot approach
the consideration of the objections raised by Nicaragua to the
validity of the Award as a Court of Appeal. The Court is not called
upon to pronounce on whether the arbitrator's decision was right
or wrong. These and cognate considerations have no relevance to
the function that the Court is called upon to discharge in these
proceedings, which is to decide whether the Award is proved to
be a nullity having no effect.

Nicaragua's first complaint is that the King of Spain exceeded
his jurisdiction by reason of non-observance of the rules laid down
in Article II of the Gémez-Bonilla Treaty. It is contended in the
first place that the arbitrator failed to observe the rules laid down
in paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article. The first of these two rules
states that “each Republic is owner of the territory which at the
date of Independence constituted respectively the provinces of
Honduras and Nicaragua”. The rule in paragraph 4 calls upon
the arbitrator to consider ‘‘fully proven ownership of territory”
and precludes recognition of “juridical value to de facto possession



alleged by one party or the other”. Nicaragua contends that the
arbitrator fixed what he regarded as a natural boundary line without
taking into account the Laws and Royal Warrants of the Spanish
State which established the Spanish administrative divisions
before the date of Independence. In the judgment of the Court
this complaint is without foundation inasmuch as the decision of
the arbitrator is based on historical and legal considerations (dere-
cho histôrico) in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article IT.

With regard to the same complaint, Nicaragua, in the second
place, stresses that the arbitrator purported to exercise his discre-
tion in granting compensations in order to establish, in so far as
possible, a well-defined natural boundary line as provided for in
paragraph 6 of Article II of the Treaty. Nicaragua contends that
this discretion was, under the said paragraph, vested in the Mixed
Boundary Commission and could not be exercised by the arbitrator.
In exercising this discretion, the arbitrator, it is urged, exercised
a power which he did not possess, or which, if conferred upon
him, he exercised far beyond its legitimate limit. The Court is
unable to share this view. An examination of the Treaty shows
that the rules laid down in Article II were intended not only for
the guidance of the Mixed Commission to which they expressly
referred, but were also intended to furnish guidance for the arbi-
tration. No convincing reason has been adduced by Nicaragua
in support of the view that, while the remaining paragraphs of
Article II were applicable to the arbitrator, paragraph 6 was
excluded and that, if it was not excluded, the arbitrator, in applying
it, exceeded his powers. In the view of the Court, the arbitrator
was under obligation to take into account the whole of Article II,
including paragraph 6, to assist him in arriving at his conclusions
with regard to the delimitation of the frontier between the two
States and, in applying the rule in that paragraph, he did not go
beyond its legitimate scope.

The Court, having carefully considered the allegations of Nica-
ragua, is unable to arrive at the conclusion that the King of Spain
went beyond the authority conferred upon him.

Nicaragua next contends that the Award is a nullity by reason
of “essential error”. The Court has not been able to discover in
the arguments of Nicaragua any precise indication of “‘essential
error” which would have the effect, as alleged by Nicaragua, of
rendering the Award a nullity. Under paragraph 7 of Article II of
the Gémez-Bonilla Treaty, “in studying the plans, maps and
other similar documents which the two Governments may submit”,
the arbitrator was to prefer those which he “deems more rational
and just”. The instances of “essential error’ that Nicaragua has
brought to the notice of the Court amount to no more than eval-
uation of documents and of other evidence submitted to the arbi-
trator. The appraisal of the probative value of documents and



evidence appertained to the discretionary power of the arbitrator
and is not open to question.

The last ground of nullity raised by Nicaragua is the alleged
lack or inadequacy of reasons in support of the conclusions arrived
at by the arbitrator. However, an examination of the Award shows
that it deals in logical order and in some detail with all relevant
considerations and that it contains ample reasoning and explana-
tions in support of the conclusions arrived at by the arbitrator.
In the opinion of the Court, this ground is without foundation.

It was further argued by Nicaragua that the Award is not capable
of execution by reason of its omissions, contradictions and obscur-
ities, and that therefore on this ground the Court must reject the
submission of Honduras praying that the Court should adjudge
and declare that Nicaragua is under an obligation to give effect
to the Award.

The operative clause of the Award fixes the common boundary
point on the coast of the Atlantic as the mouth of the river Segovia
or Coco where it flows out into the sea, taking as the mouth of the
river that of its principal arm between Hara and the Island of San
Pio where Cape Gracias a Dios is situated, and directs that, from
that point, the frontier line will follow the thalweg of the river
Segovia or Coco upstream without interruption until it reaches the
place of its confluence with the Poteca or Bodega and that thence
the frontier line will depart from the river Segovia or Coco con-
tinuing along the thalweg of the Poteca or Bodega upstream until
it joins the river Guineo or Namasl{. From this junction, the line
will follow the direction which corresponds to the demarcation of
the Sitio of Teotecacinte in accordance with the demarcation made
in 1720 to terminate at the Portillo de Teotecacinte in such manner
that the said Sz#o remains wholly within the jurisdiction of Nica-
ragua.

Nicaragua has argued that the mouth of a river is not a fixed
point and cannot serve as a common boundary between two States,
and that vital questions of navigation rights would be involved
in accepting the mouth of the river as the boundary between
Honduras and Nicaragua. The operative clause of the Award, as
already indicated, directs that ‘starting from the mouth of the
Segovia or Coco the frontier line will follow the vaguada or thalweg
of this river upstream’. It is obvious that in this context the
thalweg was contemplated in the Award as constituting the bound-
ary between the two States even at the “mouth of the river”. In
the opinion of the Court, the determination of the boundary in
this section should give rise to no difficulty.

Nicaragua argues further that the delimitation in the operative
clause leaves a gap of a few kilometres between the point of depar-



ture of the frontier line from the junction of the Poteca or Bodega
with the Guineo or Namaslf up to the Portillo de Teotecacinte, which
was the point to which the Mixed Commission had brought the
frontier line from its western boundary point. An examination of
the Award fails to reveal that there is in fact any gap with regard
to the drawing of the frontier line between the junction of the
Poteca or Bodega with the Guineo or Namasli and the Portillo de
T'eotecacinte.

In view of the clear directive in the operative clause and the
explanations in support of it in the Award, the Court does not
consider that the Award is incapable of execution by reason of any
omissions, contradictions or obscurities.

For these reasons,

THE COURT,

by fourteen votes to one,

finds that the Award made by the King of Spain on 23 December
1906 is valid and binding and that Nicaragua is under an obligation
to give effect to it.

Judge MORENO QUINTANA makes the following Declaration:

Although I am in agreement with the virtually unanimous
opinion of my colleagues with regard to the decision reached in this
case, I consider that it should have been arrived at by a different
procedural method. As a representative on this Court of a Spanish-
American legal system and confronted with a dispute between two
Spanish-American States, I believe that the legal questions which
are of particular concern to them should have been dealt with in the
first place. I refer in particular to that provided for in Article IT,
paragraph 3, of the Gâmez-Bonilla Treaty, which relates to the


application by the arbitrator of the principle of uti possidetis juris
which for more than a century has governed the territorial situation
of the Spanish-American States. By reason of its importance this
principle called for initial attention by the Court since Nicaragua
based a major ground of nullity of the Award of the King of Spain
on the arbitrator’s failure to observe it.

Again, the case essentially involves the validity or invalidity of
an international legal act. The Judgment might therefore with
advantage have established the intrinsic regularity of the Award,
after having analysed its extrinsic regularity, instead of—as it
does—resting the solution of the case in advance upon acquiescence
in the Award by the Parties. This latter situation, in the present
case, in which one of the Parties contends for the nullity of the
Award, is of no more than subsidiary importance. It provides a
procedural argument based on a situation of fact, but it does not
provide an adequate legal ground upon which to base the Judgment.

Furthermore, the features of the case do not put in issue the
good faith of the unsuccessful party. Nicaragua, during the half
century in which the Award was not implemented and in which
the question of its non-implementation was not referred by Hondu-
ras to any international tribunal, may have had reasons, although
ill-founded, for believing in the nullity of that legal act. A number
of attempts by Nicaragua to obtain an arbitral decision to that
effect remained unsuccessful. There was nothing to prevent the
Court from so finding. Honour was due to the State which, together
with the successful party and with Costa Rica, Guatemala and
El Salvador, gave so splendid an example of devotion to the cause
of law in setting up in 1907 the Central American Court of Justice,
the first example in the world of an international judicial tribunal.
The technical function of the Court is not incompatible with that
of rendering in its judgments peace to the spirit, particularly in the
case of sovereign States. Pax est justitia.
