1. The Court has analysed and assessed with great care the vast
amount of historical and diplomatic information placed before it. Upon
a detailed consideration of all this material, the Court has arrived at the
conclusion that the northern channel of the River Chobe constitutes the
international boundary between Botswana and Namibia, in terms of
Article ITI (2) of the 1890 Treaty between Germany and Great Britain.

2. A cardinal feature in this complex of information is the long con-
tinued Masubian use and occupation of Kasikili/Sedudu Island from a
period prior to the 1890 Treaty for upwards of half a century thereafter.
Namibia uses this information for two distinct purposes. It argues that
the conduct of both administrations in reference to this use and occupa-
tion corroborates its interpretation that Article III (2) of the Treaty refers
to the southern channel'. It also argues that such use and occupation
establishes an entirely independent Namibian prescriptive claim to
sovereignty over the Island”.

The entirety of this opinion concentrates on the first of these Namibian
bases of claim.

3. On the central question of the legal significance of this use and
occupation, I incline to a somewhat different approach to that adopted
by the Court. This leads me to a different conclusion regarding the inter-
national boundary.

My reasons for concluding that the southern channel constitutes the
international boundary are set out in Part A of this opinion.

4. Part B of this opinion deals with a different set of concerns.

Since my finding places Kasikili/Sedudu Island within the territory of
Namibia, while the Chobe Game Park to the south falls within the terri-
tory of Botswana, it positions within two territorial jurisdictions what is
essentially a single wildlife sanctuary — a sanctuary, moreover, which is
one of the most prized wildlife habitats in southern Africa.

5. The Island is frequented, as far as one can gather from the plead-
ings, by a rich variety of wildlife. Elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo,
lechwe, rhinoceros, giraffe, eland, baboon, lion, zebra, leopard, and fish
eagle either frequent the Island or visit it from time to time. As the
Island, together with the Chobe Game Park to the south, forms the natu-
ral habitat of this wildlife, my conclusion that the Island falls within the
territorial jurisdiction of Namibia necessitates a consideration of the
environmental principles drawn in by such a finding, without which this
opinion would be incomplete. One of these is the principle of joint

régimes, a matter peripherally involved in the Court’s stipulation of equal
access to the navigational use of the river. However, my finding necessi-
tates a more detailed examination of this concept, which the Court has so
far-sightedly incorporated in its Judgment.

6. Thus, on the one hand, this case transports us back to the age of
empire-building in Africa, and requires us to re-enter the time frame of
that era in order to understand what Britain and Germany had really
agreed upon when dividing the relevant African territories between them.
On the other hand, it raises issues which project us into a vital new area
of international law, the rapid development of which will be a feature of
the international law of the future.

PART A

Introduction

7. This case turns upon the interpretation of Article III (2) of the 1890
Treaty between Germany and Great Britain. The sphere in which the
exercise of influence is reserved to Germany is described as bounded by a
line which runs eastward along the 18th parallel of south latitude “till it
reaches the river Chobe, and descends the centre of the main channel of
that river to the junction of the Zambezi” (emphasis added). The German
version of the Treaty uses the term “Thalweg des Hauptlaufes” for the
English words italicized.

8. Problems arise in this case because of the bifurcation of the River
Chobe into two channels which run to the south and the north of the
disputed Island and reunite thereafter. The legal ownership of the Island
would depend on whether the northern or southern channel is considered
to be the main channel. If the northern channel is the main channel, the
Island would fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Botswana, while a
determination that it is the southern channel would bring it within the
jurisdiction of Namibia.

A central question therefore is the interpretation of the italicized Eng-
lish and the corresponding German expressions. Are they synonymous
and, if they have different connotations, how does one interpret this
clause?

9. I am inclined to the view that the German terms were intended to be
synonymous with the English expression “centre of the main channel”.
Yet, the German word “thalweg” often carries additional technical con-
notations as well. However, whether one reads the two expressions as
synonymous or whether one gives the word “thalweg” a different and
special connotation, it seems to me, for reasons which will be amplified
later, that they point in the direction of the southern channel being the
boundary indicated by the Treaty.



10. Since the terms used are not so explicit as to point definitively to
one or the other channel of the river, it becomes necessary to derive
assistance from such aids to interpretation as are permitted by the law
relating to treaties. Inasmuch as the cardinal question involved is how the
boundary was understood by the parties or their agents in the context of
the period of the Treaty, i.e., 1890 and the years immediately succeeding,
there is invaluable assistance to be derived from the way in which the
authorities on both sides regarded the regular Masubian crossings of the
northern channel. These movements occurred regularly for over 50 years
after the Treaty, without the faintest suggestion from either side that they
involved the crossing of an international boundary.

11. After outlining the relevant rules of treaty interpretation and the
legal significance, in that context, of the Masubian use and occupation of
the Island, I shall consider the implications of the phrases used in
the Treaty, and the ambivalence of the other criteria that have been
suggested for determining what is the main channel.

General Approach to Questions of Interpretation Arising in This Case

12. The first stage of any exercise in treaty interpretation is to interpret
the words according to their ordinary meaning. Even at this initial stage,
the task is complicated by the fact that the expressions used may carry a
legal meaning and a scientific meaning as well. The normal rule of inter-
pretation of documents that words are to be interpreted according to
their ordinary meaning is naturally modified if those words also bear a
technical meaning in the context in which they are used.

13. This case presents a classic instance of what the law relating to
treaties would class as a situation where the ordinary or indeed the legal
and scientific meaning of the words used leaves one in considerable doubt
as to the correct interpretation. Either interpretation — that which
regards the northern channel as the main channel or that which regards
the southern channel as the main channel — can be supported by a
wealth of scientific and circumstantial data, based upon different criteria
such as breadth, depth and volume, which have no necessary ranking
order among them. While not discounting the high scientific and techni-
cal expertise of the experts who have been called before the Court by
both Parties, it is necessary to note that there is a limit to the assistance
they can give in the determination of the question which is the main
channel of the Chobe River.

14. Since the matter thus remains unclear, another basic rule of inter-
pretation is called into play, permitting a court to look further into the
way in which the parties or their agents in fact acted upon the document.
Parties know best in what sense they used any particular words and, espe-



cially in the case of an old or ancient document, this helps the modern
interpreter considerably.

15. In this opinion, I shall place particular emphasis on this approach,
as the words used are capable of more than one construction, whether
viewed according to the ordinary meaning of the words used, or accord-
ing to their legal or technical meaning. Since the document we are con-
sidering is over a hundred years old, the way in which the document was
understood at the time is clearly a powerful aid to its interpretation.

16. In determining this rather obscure question so long after the date
of the Treaty, it must be acknowledged that the meaning we are searching
for must have been much more apparent to those dealing with it closer to
the time. Who better than they would know which of the two channels
was considered at the time of the Treaty to be the main channel?

17. I am not, in this context, directing my attention to Namibia’s alter-
native claim of prescriptive occupation of Kasikili/Sedudu Island, in the
years immediately following the Treaty. I am here concerned, rather,
with determining what would be a reasonable construction of the ambigu-
ous expression “main channel”, having regard to the conduct of those
who were closest in time to the Treaty. In the crucial period immediately
following the Treaty, how was it acted upon by those who were closest
not only in time, but also in fact, to its practical operation?

It is apparent that there could not have been an implementation of the
terms of the Treaty in the period immediately following the Treaty, in a
manner which ran contrary to the sense of the two administrations as to
what the Treaty meant.

18. I may add that contemporaneous conduct in relation to the Treaty
is especially important in this case in the light of the fact that observa-
tions regarding the various qualities of the river — whether they be
breadth or depth or volume of flow — can vary considerably over a
period of a hundred years, and could depend very much on the time of
observation, be it the wet season, the dry season or any other. The sense
in which the Treaty was understood contemporaneously is the best index
to what was actually intended, and any search for clarification of the
terms used must focus intensely on this aspect.

Article 31 of the Vienna Convention

19. This brings me to a consideration of Article 31, paragraph 3 (b),
of the Vienna Convention, which has been the subject of detailed written
and oral submissions by both Parties. Namibia has contended that it
refers to “any subsequent practice . . . which establishes the understand-



ing of the parties regarding its interpretation”*, and that it therefore
extends to conduct that takes the form of silence or inaction.

20. Botswana has resisted this contention“, arguing that the Court
should be cautious in the face of this suggestion, and that the meaning of
the word “agreement” should not be thus watered down. Botswana has
also argued that:

“In the present case the whole point is that the acts alleged to
constitute relevant acts of jurisdiction by Namibia are intended to
constitute an independent source of title, that is, on the basis of
prescription.”?

21. This submission does not accord with the submission of Namibia
that it was relying upon this evidence for a twofold purpose. The estab-
lishment of prescriptive title through this evidence was only one of them.


23. 1 accept Namibia’s submission that the word “agreement” in
Article 31, paragraph 3 (b), of the Vienna Convention can be read in the
sense of “understanding”, and can therefore cover silence and inaction as

well. This view derives support not only from the general law relating to
the interpretation of documents, but also from the travaux préparatoires
of the Convention®. In paragraph 49 of its Judgment, the Court likewise
gives its support to the view that the Parties’ understanding of the Treaty
is the basis for the importance of subsequent practice.

24. The substitution of the word “agreement” for the word “under-
standing”, which was contained even in the International Law Commis-
sion’s penultimate draft, occurred in the context of bringing the English
text into line with the French, Russian and Spanish texts’. The word
“agreement” in the Convention bears a meaning analogous to the French
and Spanish “accord” or “acuerdo”, respectively, and does not therefore
rule out an understanding which may not be couched in the form of a
verbal agreement®. In the words of Sir Humphrey Waldock :

“The word ‘understanding’ was chosen by the Commission instead
of ‘agreement’ expressly in order to indicate that the assent of a
party to the interpretation may be inferred from its reaction or
absence of reaction to the practice.”

The French and Spanish versions used the words “accord” and “acuerdo”,
which themselves do not necessarily bear the meaning of an agreement
expressly made in so many words '?. The word “agreement” in Article 31,
paragraph 3 (b), of the Convention must not therefore be interpreted to
be restricted to a verbal agreement. It could include an understanding
manifested by conduct.

25. What has to be taken into account together with the context is
“any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the

¢ See the remarks of the Special Rapporteur, in discussing the comments by govern-
ments on the ILC Draft, 1964, that the ILC intended that evidence of subsequent practice
indicating a “common understanding” should be taken as an “authentic interpretation
comparable to an interpretative agreement’ (The Vienna Convention on the Law of Trea-
ties, Travaux Préparatoires, Dietrich Rauschning, ed., 1978, p. 247, para. 18).

7 See United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties, First Session, 26 March-
24 May, 1968, 1969, p. 442, para. 29.

8 Indeed, English speaking delegations appeared content with the word “understand-
ing”. Thus Australia and the United States had introduced an amendment which, while
retaining the words “understanding”, sought to introduce the word “common” before it
(United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties, supra, p. 442, para. 32).

understanding of the parties regarding its interpretation” !!. I refer also to
the Beagle Channel Arbitration where the Court of Arbitration observed:

“The Court cannot accept the contention that no subsequent con-
duct, including acts of jurisdiction, can have probative value as a
subsidiary method of interpretation unless representing a formally
stated or acknowledged ‘agreement’ between the parties. The terms
of the Vienna Convention do not specify the ways in which ‘agree-
ment’ may be manifested.” 1

The ample jurisprudence of this Court relating to subsequent prac-
tice!* also shows that “the way in which the parties have actually con-
ducted themselves in relation to the treaty affords legitimate evidence as
to its correct interpretation” 4,

26. For the purposes of the case before us, the words “any subsequent
agreement” seem to me to refer to any consensus or common under-
standing in regard to how the words in question are to be viewed. The
word “agreement” here is not restricted to a subsequent agreement in the
sense of a fresh verbal agreement superimposed upon the original. It also
embraces a consensus or common understanding, as shown by conduct,
regarding its interpretation or application. Such conduct can take the
form of action or inaction, affirmation or silence. I uphold the Namibian
contention in this regard, and do not think it waters down the meaning of
the term “agreement”, as Botswana contends.

27. In other words, what we are looking at is not a variation of the
Treaty by another agreement, but a consensus or common understanding
between the Parties (as manifested by conduct, which may include action
or inaction) as to how the words of the Treaty were interpreted and acted
upon. In the words of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice:

“conduct usually forms a more reliable guide to intention and pur-
pose than anything to be found for instance in the preparatory work

of the treaty, simply because it has taken concrete and active, and
not merely verbal or paper, form” !*.

Further, “there is no doubt about the standing of [this] principle, as an
independent principle, which, in a proper case, it may be not only legiti-
mate but necessary to make use of” '°.

This approach does not involve an attempt to move away from the text
of the Treaty, as suggested by Botswana!’, but rather an attempt to call
in aid the conduct of the parties as a means of understanding the actual
terms of the Treaty.

28. I stress, of course, that resort to subsequent practice, as showing
contemporaneous understanding of the treaty, can only be had when the
ordinary meaning of the words used in the Treaty is not sufficiently clear
— as is pre-eminently the situation in the present case. Words so charged
with ambiguity as those under consideration here demand the use of
supplementary means of interpretation, and contemporaneous under-
standing ranks high among them.

29. We are not here interpreting or applying a legal concept, in which
case intertemporal principles might, in certain cases, attract the meaning
that concept bears at the time of interpretation. Rather, we are here
examining a question of fact as to which of the two channels was con-
sidered by the parties at that time to be the main channel. This principle
of contemporaneity is one of the important principles of treaty interpre-
tation'®, and is not, I think, given its proper effect by taking into
account, as the Court has done, the attitude of the Parties more than
50 years later, when political and other circumstances may well have
necessitated a change of administrative policy from that which had
been evidenced for the half century immediately following the Treaty.

30. Colonial administrations were specially sensitive, in the period of
colonial rivalry, to incursions upon their territory from the territory of
another colonial power. This would be expected to be particularly so at
the time a treaty is concluded which defines their respective areas. At that
time, the administrative authorities in the border regions, even though
thinly spread, would be specially on the alert to incidents of use and
occupation of the territory which are contrary to their contemporaneous
understanding of what the treaty defines. If, indeed, there are such inci-
dents and, as in this case, they are openly conducted, the administrative
authorities would naturally register their concern. If, on the contrary,

!% Fitzmaurice, op. cit, p. 359.



they are aware of significant acts pointing to a particular understanding
of the Treaty, and take no steps indicative of a different understanding,
the natural conclusion to be drawn from such conduct is that such acts of
use and occupation accorded with their contemporaneous understanding
of the Treaty.

Indicia of Occupation

31. The use and occupation of this territory by Caprivi residents must
be considered in the context of the particular geographical characteristics
of the region and contemporary modes of human use and occupation of
such territory.

We must not look for indicia of occupation in terms of settled housing
or ordered agriculture, burial sites, or schools, for the very nature of this
terrain prevented settled habitation in the manner known to Western
jurisprudence and tradition. At best there would have been temporary
occupation in makeshift huts from time to time as the rains and the cli-
mate determined. Such mud huts as there were would tend to be washed
away during floodtime, for they were not constructed for permanent
occupation. Even agricultural holdings could have been at best of a
rather haphazard variety as compared with the holdings one is accus-
tomed to in settled societies. Aerial photographs likewise would not
reveal the ordered patterns of cultivation one is accustomed to see in cul-
tivated agricultural land.

Factors such as these must be taken into account in assessing the infer-
ences we could draw regarding Masubian occupation of the Island when
the floods of each year had subsided.

32. Quite apart from the flood factor, there may well have been a lack
of regularity in Masubian occupation of this territory, as is characteristic
of a society which does not follow a regular routine year in and year out.
Concepts of settled occupation, in default of which a territory is deemed
unoccupied and even res nullius, which traditional principles of interna-
tional law have led us to expect, must consequently be discarded in
approaching a case such as the present. One recalls, in this context, judi-
cial observations such as those in the Legal Status of Eastern Green-
land'®, holding that even slender proof may satisfy a court of the exercise
of sovereign rights in cases of thinly populated or unsettled territory,
where the other party cannot make out a superior claim.

19 P.C.1J., Series AIB, No. 53, p. 46.


The Significance of Masubian Use and Occupation

33. Was the Masubian use and occupation of this territory, in the
years immediately succeeding the Treaty, an occupation that was merely
permissive, under some external authority, or was it resorted to on the
basis that the occupiers felt entitled to such occupation without seeking
the permission of any external authority?

If the latter was the case, their occupation must be presumed to be
occupation under the State of which they were the subjects, rather than
under any other State which claimed to have authority over the territory.

34. This approach may have its limitations, as the acts of occupation
of the Masubia of the Caprivi Strip were not sovereign acts, but yet such
legal benefit as might accrue from them must enure to the benefit of their
sovereign authority rather than any other. This would be especially so if
the occupation was an organized occupation under their chiefs rather
than sporadic acts of occupation by individuals. In fact, the evidence
indicates that the tribesmen attached great sentimental value to the
Island which was regarded as a seat of chiefly authority, and that such
occupation was part of the living tradition of their tribe.

35. Namibia argues that

“the Masubia of Caprivi had occupied and cultivated Kasikili Island
from before the conclusion of the 1890 treaty until well into the
second half of the present century and that Namibia’s predecessors
in title had continuously exercised jurisdiction over the area with the
full knowledge of Botswana and its predecessors and without any
official objection or protest from them until 1984” 2°.

I believe there is no dispute regarding Masubian cultivation of the
Island until 1947, allowing for such occasional intervals as were necessi-
tated by climatic conditions. T believe the evidence supports the view that,
from 1890 to 1947, such cultivation during the period when the Island
was not flooded was a regular feature.

36. Colonial governments depended heavily on chiefly authority at a
local level, and the claims and movements of chieftains were not matters
of indifference to them.

What do we infer from this?

This may not have been occupation by a sovereign government such as
is necessary for the acquisition of title by adverse prescription, though it
could come close to such an interpretation. However, it was an occupa-
tion of the land of which the administrations on both sides were not

20 Counter-Memorial of Namibia, Vol. I. p. 40, para. 83.



unaware. If this occupation was in disregard of the 1890 Treaty, one
would have expected the Government of Botswana or its predecessors to
lodge a protest, or at least to make it clear that the Masubia were there on
sufferance. There is no evidence of any such action on Botswana’s part.

Contemporaneous Understanding of the Treaty as Evidenced by the
Conduct of the Parties

37. For the purpose of assessing the Parties’ understanding of the
Treaty, I now move on to a consideration of the factual material placed
before the Court regarding official conduct on both sides. In doing so,
I stress that what is most important to the legal question [ am addressing
is the common understanding of the two administrations in the years
immediately succeeding the Treaty, and not during periods half a century
or more after the Treaty.

38. Changes of official attitude that occurred at a later period, e.g., in
1947 or thereafter, throw little light on how the Parties understood the
Treaty at the time it was entered into, or shortly thereafter. New policy
orientations, and indeed new configurations of political power, may weil
have intervened half a century or more after the Treaty, having regard to
the profound changes that took place in the region. For these reasons,
I differ from the Court’s conclusion of absence of agreement, based upon
events between 1947 and 1951 and, indeed, thereafter”!.

Evidence of Common Understanding

39. In the light of the nature of Masubian occupation, as discussed
earlier, I proceed to set out a summary of what can be gathered from the
material before us, in regard to the common understanding of the Treaty
in the years immediately following it. In doing so, I start with some of
the findings of the Court as set out in paragraph 62 of the Court’s Judg-
ment.

— Prior to 1947, no differences had arisen between Bechuanaland and
the power administering the Caprivi Strip with regard to the bound-
ary in the area of Kasikili Island.

— It appears that, on the basis of the maps available at the time, the

boundary had until then been supposed to be located in the southern
channel of the Chobe.

2! Judgment, para. 63.



— While in 1948 a local official from Caprivi and a local official from
Bechuanaland came to the conclusion that the main channel was the
northern one, at the same time they noted that since at least 1907 use
had been made of the Island by Caprivi tribesmen without objection
by the Bechuanaland authorities, and that that situation still con-
tinued.

— It was subsequently, after consulting London, that the higher authori-
ties in Bechuanaland took the view that the boundary was located in
the northern channel.

Such subsequent action, taken nearly 60 years after the date of the
Treaty, can scarcely be used to help in showing how the Parties under-
stood the Treaty, especially where their earlier conduct points to a dif-
ferent understanding.

40. One should also take into account that

— Masubia use and occupation of the Island was of as significant a
nature as the terrain and climatic conditions allowed.

— Masubia use and occupation included even the residence of a chief
and a well organized village community and a school, factors of
much significance when we consider that such occupation was never
challenged by an administration whose successors claim that this
was their territory, and did not raise objections thereto until nearly
60 years after the Treaty.

— One of the initial acts of the first German Imperial Resident, Streit-
wolf, was to install the Masubia chief, Chikamatondo, who was to be
responsible to him for the area?

— In later years, the Masubia chief himself lived on the Island, and held
his court there.

As already observed, Botswana’s contention that the “subsequent con-
duct” argument is one grounded in acquisitive prescription®® does not
take account of the fact that these are in fact two separate arguments.
Factors throwing light on the contemporaneous understanding of the
Treaty can be considered quite apart from their weight as supporting
acquisitive prescription,

41. For these reasons, there is sufficient material from which to con-
clude an understanding on the part of the Parties to the Treaty, as evi-
denced by their practice for upwards of half a century, that they regarded
the southern boundary of the River Chobe as the main channel.

23 Reply of Botswana, Vol. I, p. 55, para. 157.



Suggested Contrary Factors

42. Some items of fact asserted by Botswana to evidence non-recogni-
tion of Namibian sovereignty need now to be examined.

(a) The Eason Report, 1912

43. Botswana relies heavily on Captain Eason’s report in which he
stated that “undoubtedly the North should be claimed as the main chan-
nel”. Here was an occasion where the precise question now in issue was
specifically brought to the notice of the governmental authorities in ques-
tion, with a categorical recommendation that a claim should be made. It
must be presumed that this assertion received official consideration. Yet
no such claim was made. A reasonable inference is that higher officials
considered this recommendation and took a considered decision not to
act upon it.

This is confirmatory of the Namibian position rather than a rejection
of it. Moreover, the instructions to Eason of Lieutenant Colonel Panzera,
the Resident Commissioner in Bechuanaland, reveal that the matter was
in fact under consideration by the Bechuanaland authorities and that
they were seeking a solution to the question which was the main channel.
This reinforces the conclusion that the authorities took a definite decision
not to act on the conclusions of Eason, thus administratively rejecting the
recommendation that a claim be made that the northern channel was the
main channel.

Colonel Panzera instructed Eason that the question under considera-
tion could only be solved by following up the deepest channel in which
there is the strongest current, and that the width of the channel was not
the matter in issue. Eason’s observations made during the dry season
could hardly have been observations in accordance with these guidelines,
for during the dry season there is scarcely any current in either channel.
Indeed, Eason’s observations were made at the end of an exceptional
drought during the previous 12 months?*,

(b) The Trollope-Dickinson arrangement, 1951

44. This relates to a period more than 60 years after the Treaty, and
does not have the same relevance to contemporaneous understanding as
events closer to the Treaty. I shall still examine it in view of the impor-
tance attached to it by Botswana.

24 Memorial of Botswana, Vol. III, Annex 15, p. 226, para. 2.



The Botswana Memorial places much reliance on what is stated to be
a “joint report” by Major Trollope, the South African magistrate for the
Eastern Caprivi, and Noel Redman, the District Commissioner for the
Bechuanaland Protectorate. The report, which does not state the reasons
for its conclusions, states that the main channel lies in the waterway
which would include the Island in question in the Bechuanaland Protec-
torate.

Yet, as with the Eason Report, there are circumstances which adversely
affect the weight of this opinion.

(i) After the receipt of the joint report, matters between the two gov-
ernments were not settled on this basis, but the officials “agreed to
differ on the legal aspect regarding Kasikili Island” 2°. No advance
was therefore made on the pre-existing position.

(ii) Trollope himself stressed the aspect of use and occupation as indi-
cating that the Island was part of the Caprivi Strip”.

(iii) The Legal Advisers of the Bechuanaland Protectorate seem to have
proceeded on the basis that the Island had never been treated as part
of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and therefore “shall be deemed
not to be included, and never to have been included, in the [Bechua-
naland] Protectorate”?’. There could hardly be a more categorical
rejection of the position contended for by Botswana.

(iv) The Report expressly leaves open the question of the impact of the
use of the Island by Caprivi tribesmen since 1907 on the question of
the ownership of the Island.

(c) The 1984-1986 discussions resulting from the shooting incident of
24 October 1984

45. I do not need to deal with these discussions as they were nearly a
century after the Treaty, and can throw little light on how the Treaty was
contemporaneously understood.

46. In the result, there appears to have been a long-standing use by
Caprivi tribesmen of Kasikili/Sedudu Island, without any official protest
or assertion of rights by the authorities of the British possessions to
the south. The right of the Caprivi tribesmen to use the Island was
undisputed not only by the Bechuanaland authorities, but even by the
Bechuanaland tribesmen — as was noted by the Secretary for External

obscurity (ibid., para. 8, and Ann. 73, para. 4).

to the Chief Secretary to the High Commissioner for Bechuanaland 2.

47. The understanding that the Island was not Botswana territory
appears to have been so deep-rooted that it carried over into the years
immediately succeeding the achievement of Botswana’s independence.
Important evidence in this regard is the action of a Botswana magistrate
in 1972 (six years after Botswana achieved independence) in acquitting
three Caprivi tribesmen who had been arrested on Kasikili Island by
game wardens of the Chobe National Park and detained in Kasane for
five days. According to affidavits submitted by Namibia, the magistrate
criticized the game wardens for arresting them on Caprivi territory”.

48. Botswana denies this incident, stating that it depends only on the
affidavits of the accused persons. However this may be, the occurrence of
an incident of this nature is confirmed by the fact that in 1973 South
Africa sent a protest note to the President of Botswana relating to the
entry of armed Botswana officials into what it described as “Eastern
Caprivi territory” *°, and that Botswana did not reply to this communica-
tion, even though South Africa sent a follow-up inquiry?!. The matter
was thus taken up administratively at governmental level, with South
Africa issuing a note on the matter to the President of Botswana. There
was no assertion of rights by the Government of Botswana in reply.

All this is far different from the judicial and/or governmental response
that would have ensued had it been the official view in Botswana that this
was Botswana territory.

49. These circumstances are sufficient to show the official perception
of the position of the main channel from a period comparatively close in
time to the Treaty to the period even after independence.

What is most important to note against this background of official atti-
tudes is the openness of the manner in which the Masubia tribesmen had
over the years for nearly half a century visited, lived in and cultivated this
Island whenever the weather and river conditions permitted. They did
this without acknowledgment of title under any external authority, but as
part of their traditional lifestyle. This was a fact that was well known in
the area and must be taken to have been particularly well known to the
officials exercising jurisdiction over it.

50. Against this background, the absence of contrary action by a State
authority claiming title to the territory is difficult to reconcile with an
understanding of the Treaty in any sense other than that it treated the
Island as lying within the territory that fell to Namibia — a result pre-
supposing a commonly accepted view on both sides that the “main
channel”, for the purposes of the Treaty, was the southern one.

In short, if one is attempting to understand the terms of an expression
in the Treaty which is equally capable of two interpretations, there is an
almost conclusive indication in all this conduct of the way in which the
authorities on both sides of the border understood and interpreted the
agreement. That understanding and interpretation are clearly indicative
of the Island being considered without any objection or assertion to the
contrary to be part of the Caprivi Strip.

51. 1 stress again that I am using this material in regard to use and
occupation and non-protest by the rival State authority only as an aid to
the understanding of the terms of the Treaty, in view of the ambiguity
therein which needs to be resolved. I am not using it as evidence of pre-
scriptive title. I stress particularly that this is not material on the basis of
which the terms of the Treaty can be altered. It is only a basis on which
the terms to the Treaty can be interpreted and better understood.

Although Namibia argues further that this record constitutes an inde-
pendent title to sovereignty over the Island by operation of the doctrines
of acquiescence, recognition and prescription, I need not go into this
argument for the reasons indicated above.

Ambivalence of Other Criteria

52. Various criteria were suggested in the course of the argument for
determining the main channel. Among these were navigability, the
thalweg concept, greatest mean depth, depth at the most shallow
point, greatest capacity, and velocity of flow.

I proceed however to make some observations on these aspects.

Navigability as a Criterion for Interpreting “Main Channel”

53. There seem to be strong arguments indicating that in the context
of the river we are considering, namely the Chobe River, navigability is
an inappropriate criterion for the determination of its main channel.

It is to be remembered that there was no uniform way in which at the
period in question river boundaries were designated or understood. For
example, as the Namibian Counter-Memorial points out, there were, in



the context of treaties fixing African river boundaries, a variety of expres-
sions that were used:

1884 — “up the course of the Limpopo River . ..”
1891 — “the centre of the channel of the [River] Ruo”
“the mid-channel of that [Aroangwa] River”
“the centre of the main channel of the Sabi”
1898 — “the median line of the [Niger] river”
1899 — “the centre of the River Ruo up-stream”
“shall follow the Malosa River up-stream”
1911 — “the line of the thalweg of those [Ruo and Shiré] rivers”
1912 — “the centre of the channel of the River Gaeresi”
1926 — “the middle line of the Kunene River, that is to say, the line
drawn equidistant from both banks” 3?

Some of these rivers were navigable. Some were not. The Chobe was
largely non-navigable. There was no set rule of interpretation reading
navigability into these phrases. To apply navigability as a criterion indis-
criminately to all river boundaries, whether the river be navigable or not,
does not seem to be appropriate.

54. One bears in mind in this context the known desire of the German
empire to have access to the Zambezi. This was a general principle all
colonial powers pursued as they desired the maximum freedom of move-
ment to, from and within their territories. Yet this was at the time a
rather theoretical concept, for the Zambezi was not a navigable river, at
any rate near its junction with the Chobe, and the navigability of the
Chobe along its entire length and for the greater part of the year was not
even in contemplation.

55. Moreover, using navigability as a criterion does not accord with
the principle that words should be given their ordinary meaning. I would
not therefore give to the words “the main channel” a meaning which is
dependent on the concept of navigability, which was not a dominant
meaning in the minds of the drafters of the document.

56. In relation to navigation, it is to be noted that, even up to 1914,
such navigation as there was on the Chobe River was done by dug-out
canoes or mekoro and that even the colonial officials used no better
craft 3. Moreover, there was clearly no evidence of regular, scheduled
commercial navigation**. Even as late as the 1940s when the much dis-
cussed timber venture of W. C. Ker was inaugurated, this was the first
attempt at the use of the Chobe as a means of transport. However, there

Brownlie, African Boundaries: A Legal and Diplomatic Encyclopaedia, 1979.

33 Botswana's reply to Judge Fleischhauer’s Question 1.
34 Ibid.



is doubt as to whether Ker in fact set up such a service, and Namibia has
stated in answer to a question by President Schwebel that it has not been
able to find any evidence that W. C. Ker ever actually transported timber
through the northern channel.

57. For these reasons, definitive importance cannot be accorded to
navigation as a criterion. I note also in this connection Namibia’s answer
to Judge Fleischhauer in which it stated that it has been unable to find a
single reference to a boat of any kind at any period in history ever tra-
versing the whole length of the Chobe River where it forms a common
boundary between Namibia and Botswana.

There are limits therefore to the extent to which navigability can be
used as a criterion for determining which was the main channel.

The Thalweg Concept

58. There has been much discussion in the course of the presentations
before the Court regarding the applicability of the thalweg concept to
this case. Botswana identifies the thalweg as one of the criteria by which
to identify the main channel, defining the thalweg as “the channel most
favourable to the movement of vessels proceeding downstream when the
water is at its lowest”,

This argument highlights the question whether the term was used in
the Treaty as a synonym for “centre of the main channel”, or whether it
was used as a term with an independent meaning. I believe that the use of
the term “thalweg” in the Treaty was not a use of it in any technical sense
but, even if it were so used, it would enure to the benefit of Namibia.

(a) Applicability of the concept

59. If the thalweg concept is to be used in interpreting a treaty of 1890,
it must first be established that the technicalities associated with the
concept were generally recognized at the time. We cannot use the more
developed concepts of a later time to interpret a treaty entered into
more than a century ago.

The Namibian pleadings assemble 47 authorities who discussed the
thalweg concept between 1820 and 19303. These authorities represent a
variety of views — that the thalweg should be the boundary in navigable
rivers only; that it should be the boundary in all rivers; that it does not

International Law, trans. by C. A. W. Manning, 1930, p. 130.

apply at all; that it means the same as the median line; that it was not a
principle that was generally recognized; and that it was a principle
which as yet was in the realm de lege ferenda. Even the proceedings of the
Institute of International Law in 1887 reflect this uncertainty, for De
Martens, the Rapporteur for the session concerning international rivers,
did not include this provision in his project for the Institute as he said
“ce principe n’est pas généralement reconnu”?’,

60. An inference that can be drawn from all of this is that it was not a
principle so widely accepted at the time as to vary the natural meaning of
the words used in the Treaty.

However, even should the thalweg concept be deemed to be applicable,
its implications do not necessarily enure to Botswana’s benefit, as shown
in the next subsection.

(b) /mplications of the concept

61. Even if the principle were applicable, there is considerable author-
ity in support of the proposition that the thalweg concept relates not
merely to depth but also to the flow or current of the river. Indeed, some
authorities would appear to indicate that considerations relating to depth
are secondary to those relating to flow or current.

According to Westlake, for example, the thalweg is “the course taken
by boats going down stream, which again is that of the strongest
current” 38,

L. F. von Neumann, likewise, describes it as “the line that is taken by
ships going downstream, more precisely the centre of the downward
current” *°,

Other authoritative writing from around the same period may be cited
for the same proposition. Fiore, for example, speaks of the line “ou les
eaux sont les plus profondes et les plus rapides”* — a combination of
the concepts of depth and current.

62, It is not difficult to perceive the reason for the blending of depth
and current in the concept of the thalweg, for the “downway” as it liter-
ally meant, was for boats the path of the strongest current and not
necessarily the path of the deepest channel. Of course depth was also

38 J. Westlake, International Law, Part. 1, Peace, 1904, p. 141. Westlake points out that
the older authorities had taken the middle line of the river as the true boundary in
obedience to the Roman law relating to delimitation of properties, and that the thalweg
was thought to have been first proposed at the Congress of Rastatt (1798-1799).

with the most rapid flow” (1911 ed., p. 503, trans. by C. Antoine).



an important ingredient in the complex of factors that produced the
strongest current.

63. There is significance also in the fact that the line it represented was
the line of the “downway”, i.e., for ships that went down the river, and
therefore those in maximum need of using the maximum current. By con-
trast, ships going up the river needed the slowest current to fight against
— a point very clearly made by Westlake*!.

64. In the case of the two channels of the Chobe, it is clear that the
southern channel is not by any means to be disregarded from the point of
view of its use for shipping. Those who operate boats on rivers know best
the channels which suit them for downward navigation. The number of
boats using the southern channel appears to exceed by far the number of
those using the northern channel. Boatmen would know best which is the
swiftest channel for this, and it is no accident that so many of them
choose the southern channel.

Judged by this test as well, the southern channel has a very good claim
to being regarded as the main channel of the Chobe.

It is not without significance also that, while the tourist boats use the
southern channel almost exclusively, some of the boats returning from
Kasane use the northern channel‘? — an indication that the current in
that channel 1s the slow channel that is suitable for up-river navigation.

65. Another factor to be borne in mind is that mean depth cannot be
the only criterion for navigability. À river which has very great depth
along a very narrow channel would be quite unsuitable for navigation if
the sides of that deep channel rise very steeply to present very shallow
levels outside the narrow crevice of greatest depth. Boats, especially
broad-bottomed boats, would not be able to use such a channel, however
deep it might be. As Namibia has observed in its Counter-Memorial,
“Passage through a channel is controlled by the point of minimum depth,
because all craft must clear that point to traverse the channel. ”#*

66. There are obstacles of this nature in the way of free use of the
northern channel — in particular the sand bar at its entrance. By way of
contrast, the entire length of the southern channel is of sufficient depth to
accommodate the flat-bottomed boats that use it at all times of the year.
Nor does the southern channel dry out during the dry season, 1f one has
regard to the calculations of Professor Alexander“.

The Scientific Evidence

67. If the term “main channel” had been used in a contemporary
treaty, and we were seeking the true meaning of that term, scientific evi-
dence on such matters as depth, volume, breadth, and flow would help us
considerably. But the Treaty under examination is over a century old
and, even if depth, volume, breadth and flow had been constant over the
years, modern scientific criteria are not the indicia appropriate for deter-
mining what was commonly understood to be the main channel a
hundred years ago.

I hence have considerable difficulty in reaching a definitive conclusion
based upon the scientific evidence in this case.

68. In the first place, it is extremely complex and, considered in its
totality, contains opposing views by equally credible and competent
experts in the various fields covered. A plausible case can be made out for
either viewpoint using the data furnished to the Court, and this leaves
one none the wiser in the midst of all this expert information.

69. Secondly, I have grave doubts that the problem before the Court
can in any event be resolved by scientific evidence. The question we are
faced with is the meaning of an expression used by the Parties, which
meaning has to be gathered not from quantitative statistics of volume
and flow and depth, but rather from the Parties’ own understanding at
the time of the apparently simple language used in the Treaty. This was a
non-technical understanding, not dependent upon expert scientific
opinion or precise quantitative data.

70. Thirdly, even if the scientific evidence were applicable, it would be
legal criteria that would determine which aspect if any of the vast amount
of scientific data placed before the Court would be determinative. There
are no clear cut legal principles for determining this which are sufficient
to outweigh the principles of interpretation discussed already.

71. Fourthly, there is no definite principle for a ranking order among
the various scientific criteria offered. Among these criteria are capacity
(i.e, amount of flow), velocity of flow, mean depth, and depth at the
shallowest point. It is not scientific principle but non-scientific factors
that would determine the choice of the governing criterion. Moreover,
one gets a different result depending on which criterion one employs.

Cartographic Evidence

72. There is support to be gained from the maps of the two adminis-
trations for the view that the understanding of the Treaty in the period
succeeding the time of its execution was to the effect that the operative



branch of the river was that which placed the Island within Namibian
territory. Indeed, the Court has found*° that maps published subse-
quently to the 1890 Treaty, in so far as they showed the boundary at all,
for a number of years placed the boundary in the southern channel. The
1933 Bechuanaland map and the 1949 South African map are among
these.

73. Maps can of course carry varying degrees of weight depending on
their authorship and the circumstances in which they were made. More-
over, the scale of the maps is often so small as not to show clearly the
particular area which is the subject of the dispute, while other maps
which are sufficiently large can indicate the area of dispute in sufficient
detail.

Of the 16 maps in Namibia's atlas, some are too small in scale to show
Kasikili/Sedudu Island, but 12 are large enough to show the Island and
they all show the Island as Namibia's, in the sense that they show the
southern channel as the international boundary.

It is significant that among the maps showing the southern channel as
the border are several sketch maps of the Bechuanaland Protectorate
published by the British Colonial Office from 1912 to 1914 — a fact
admitted by Botswana in its Memorial*® — and referred to in Namibia's
Counter-Memorial 7.

Of the 19 Colonial Office reports containing maps, 15 show the bound-
ary on the south side of the Chobe and four on the north side.

74. The arithmetical preponderance is not so important as the fact
that not in any of these maps — leave alone the majority — are the
boundaries indicated in such a manner as to leave the disputed territory
within the boundaries of the other State. This is scarcely consistent with
the position that the Treaty was intended to treat the northern channel as
the main channel. Rather, this statistic supports the view that the under-
standing of the Treaty was certainly not such as to place the Island in
question within the territory of Bechuanaland — in other words that the
understanding of Parties was that the main channel was the southern
channel. Prominent among the British maps is the official British map of
1933 used up to 1965, one year before independence, which shows the
Island within the Caprivi Strip“.

75. Namibia likewise has the advantage of a number of official maps
on the German side also indicating the southern channel as the bound-
ary. Among these are Seiner’s map, the principal large-scale map used by
German officials in Berlin and in the field, from its publication until the

end of German rule in Namibia *®. It was sent by Germany to the British
Foreign Office during the 1909-1914 negotiations relating to the southern
boundary of the Caprivi Strip. The boundary is there shown placing
Kasikili Island very clearly on the Namibian side. So, also, is the case
with von Frankenberg’s map 3°. Adding to the weight of these maps is the
South African Official Map of 1949°!, the principal map used by South
Africa until Namibian independence.

76. The cartographic evidence thus seems to me to be in favour of the
Namibian position, and of the contemporaneous understanding of the
Parties, as outlined earlier in this opinion.
