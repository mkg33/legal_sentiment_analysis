                        The key question in these proceedings was whether Italian courts violated the
                     jurisdictional immunity of Germany — The Italian courts set aside the immunity
                     of Germany with respect to claims for reparation of serious humanitarian law vio‑
                     lations in the absence of other remedial avenues — The Court failed to adequately
                     address this core issue — The Court instead focused on the extent of immunity for
                     acts jure imperii when committed by armed forces during armed conflict and the
                     strength of jus cogens norms — The Court’s analysis does not adequately address
                     the real-life situation of the victims of Nazi atrocities without other means of
                     redress — Immunity should not be used as a screen where no other remedial ave‑
                     nues are available — The victims’ petition to Italian domestic courts was a last
                     attempt to obtain reparation — Immunity is not an immutable value in interna‑
                     tional law — The scope of immunity has been contracting over the past century as
                     the international legal system shifted from a State-centred model to one that also
                     protects the rights of human beings — It is as full of holes as Swiss cheese —
                     There is considerable divergence in the extent and scope of immunity in State prac‑
                     tice — Uncertainties on customary rules cannot be resolved by a formalistic exer‑
                     cise of surveying divergent judicial decisions — Customary international law is not
                     a question of relative numbers — Consideration must be given to the circumstances
                     and nature of each case and the factors underlying it — Resort may also be had to
                     the general principles underlying human rights and humanitarian law — A balance
                     must be sought between the function of immunity and the realization of fundamen‑
                     tal human rights and humanitarian law — There should be a proportionality and
                     legitimacy assessment with respect to granting immunity when the customary rules
                     are found to be fragmentary or unsettled — The evolution of the law on immunity
                     has often occurred through isolated domestic court decisions that gradually become
                     mainstream — Assertion of jurisdiction by domestic courts crystallizes an emerg‑
                     ing exception to State immunity — Domestic courts cannot set aside immunity
                     every time there is a claim for reparation for violations of international humanitar‑
                     ian law or human rights — In exceptional circumstances, assertion of jurisdiction
                     where there is no other remedial avenue contributes to a better observance of inter‑
                     national humanitarian law without unjustifiably indenting immunity.

                       1. I am regrettably unable to concur with the Court’s majority in find-
                     ing that :
                           “[t]he Italian Republic has violated its obligation to respect the immu-
                           nity which the Federal Republic of Germany enjoys under interna-

                           tional law by allowing civil claims to be brought against it based on
                           violations of international humanitarian law committed by the Ger-
                           man Reich between 1943 and 1945”.
                        2. I am also in disagreement with the reasoning and consideration on
                     which this finding is based.
                        3. My disagreements relate in particular to the marginal way in which
                     the core issues in dispute between the Parties have been dealt with in the
                     Judgment ; the lack of an adequate analysis of the obligation to make
                     reparations for violations of international humanitarian law (herein­
                     after IHL), which is intimately linked to the denial of State immunity in the
                     dispute before the Court ; the reasoning and conclusions of the majority
                     on the scope and extent of State immunity in international law and the
                     derogations that may be made from it ; and the approach adopted in the
                     Judgment towards the role of domestic courts in the identification and
                     evolution of international customary norms, particularly in the area of
                     State immunity.
                        I will elaborate my views on these matters below.

                        4. The jurisdictional immunity of foreign States before national courts
                     in cases concerning serious violations of human rights or humanitarian
                     law has been extensively debated in recent years in scholarly literature
                     and has given rise to conflicting judicial decisions by courts of various
                     jurisdictions. The core issues before the Court in these proceedings are
                     however of a much more limited and narrower scope. They concern deci-
                     sions by Italian courts to set aside Germany’s immunity in proceedings
                     regarding claims for reparation arising out of acts committed by the
                     Third Reich in the period 1943‑1945 whose illegality has been admitted
                     by Germany.

                         5. The claims before the Italian courts concerned certain categories of
                     victims (for a description of these categories, see paragraph 52 of the Judg-
                     ment) to whom Germany allegedly failed to pay compensation, thus leaving
                     them without other means of redress for the harm suffered. The Court had
                     therefore to determine whether the refusal of Italian courts to grant jurisdic-
                     tional immunity to Germany with respect to claims of victims of Nazi crimes
                     in search of redress and reparation constitutes an internationally wrongful
                     act, in the absence of other remedial avenues. The Court’s answer to this
                     question is positive, and I disagree with it. But my disagreement concerns
                     also the approach adopted by the Court to reach this conclusion.
                         6. The Court recognizes that it has jurisdiction to determine whether Ger-
                     many’s failure to pay compensation to those categories of victims, whose
                     illegal treatment by the Third Reich has been admitted by Germany, is capa-
                     ble of having an effect on the existence and scope of Germany’s jurisdictional

                     293 	 jurisdictional immunities of the state (diss. op. yusuf)

                     immunity before Italian courts, and consequently whether the Italian courts
                     were legally justified, under these specific circumstances, to deny immunity
                     to Germany (Judgment, para. 50). The Court, however, in its consideration
                     of the merits, limits its examination, almost entirely, to the issue of
                     “whether . . . immunity is applicable to acts committed by the armed forces
                     of a State . . . in the course of conducting an armed conflict” (ibid., para. 61).
                        7. This formulation of the core issues is, in my view, too abstract and
                     formalistic as compared to the real life situation of the victims of Nazi
                     atrocities who, for the lack of any alternative means of redress, had to
                     submit their claims for reparation to Italian courts. The dispute before
                     the Court is not about the general applicability of immunity to unlawful
                     acts committed by the armed forces of a State in a situation of armed
                     conflict. This is a very broad subject which is best left for academic
                     papers and scholarly discussions. The dispute in this case is about the
                     decisions of Italian courts to set aside the jurisdictional immunity of Ger-
                     many to allow certain categories of Italian victims, who were unable to
                     obtain effective reparations for crimes committed by the Third Reich and
                     admitted by Germany, to have an alternative means of redress.

                       12. In view of the direct bearing that the lack of reparations for IHL
                     violations by the Third Reich had on the refusal by Italian courts to grant
                     immunity to Germany, I find it also regrettable that the Court, despite
                     recognizing this close relationship, has not considered it necessary to
                     examine, at least in a general manner, the obligation to make reparations
                     for violations of IHL in international law.
                       13. The obligation to make reparations for damages suffered as a result
                     of breaches of humanitarian law is enshrined in Article 3 of the 1907
                     Hague Convention IV which provides that :
                           “[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of the said Regu-
                           lations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation. It
                           shall be responsible for all acts forming part of its armed forces.”
                        14. A similar provision is to be found in Article 91 of the Additional Pro-
                     tocol I of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (hereinafter “Proto-
                     col I”). These provisions do not indicate whether the beneficiaries of such
                     compensation are individuals or States. It can, however, be said that they
                     clearly establish the existence of an obligation under international law to
                     pay compensation and make reparations for violations of humanitarian law.
                        15. It is only in the past two decades or so that one may find examples

                        21. My disagreement with the Court also extends to the approach and
                     reasoning of the majority, which I find unpersuasive, on the scope and
                     extent of the jurisdictional immunity of States under international law, as
                     well as its exceptions and derogations. It is true that State immunity is a
                     rule of customary international law, and not merely a matter of comity,
                     although some legal scholars consider it only as an exception to the prin-
                     ciple of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction of States (see, for example,
                     R. Higgins, “Certain Unresolved Aspects of the Law of State Immunity”,
                     29 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law (1982), pp. 265‑276). Its
                     coverage has, however, been contracting over the past century, in light of
                     the evolution of international law from a State-centred legal system to
                     one which also protects the rights of human beings vis‑à‑vis the State.

                     297 	 jurisdictional immunities of the state (diss. op. yusuf)

                        22. The shrinking of immunity coverage has been spearheaded by the
                     decisions of domestic courts and largely prompted by the growing recog-
                     nition of the rights of individuals involved in transactions with States or
                     State-owned entities. It was indeed for the purpose of protecting the
                     rights of individuals or juridical persons vis-à-vis States that a restrictive
                     doctrine of immunities was introduced by national courts as early as the
                     nineteenth century. Similarly, the tort exception to immunity has been
                     conceived for the protection of individual rights against States.

                        23. Thus, although State immunity is important to the conduct of har-
                     monious and friendly relations between States, it is not a rule of law
                     whose coverage is well defined for all circumstances or whose consistency
                     and stability is unimpaired. There is indeed considerable divergence in the
                     manner in which the scope and extent of such immunity is interpreted
                     and applied in the practice of States, and particularly in the judicial deci-
                     sions of their courts. It is not therefore very persuasive to characterize
                     some of the exceptions to immunity as part of customary international
                     law, despite the continued existence of conflicting domestic judicial deci-
                     sions on their application, while interpreting other exceptions, similarly
                     based on divergent domestic courts’ decisions, as supporting the non-
                     existence of customary norms. This may give the impression of cherry-
                     picking, particularly where the number of cases invoked is rather limited
                     on both sides of the equation.
                        24. It may, for example, be asked whether the judicial decisions of a
                     handful of domestic courts (see paragraphs 73-74 of the Judgment) could
                     serve to substantiate the existence of customary international law based
                     on State practice which supports the proposition that :
                           “State immunity for acta jure imperii continues to extend to civil pro-
                           ceedings for acts occasioning death, personal injury or damage to
                           property committed by the armed forces and other organs of a State
                           in the conduct of armed conflict, even if the relevant acts take place
                           on the territory of the forum State” (Judgment, para. 77).

                     It could equally be asked why more weight should be attached, in terms
                     of the existence of customary law norms, to those decisions as opposed to
                     the Italian and Greek Supreme Courts’ decisions (ibid., paras. 27-36). Is
                     customary international law a question of relative numbers ?

                        Would it not have been more appropriate to recognize, in light of con-
                     flicting judicial decisions and other practices of States, that customary
                     international law in this area remains fragmentary and unsettled ?
                        25. It should be recalled that even the traditional distinction between
                     jure gestionis and jure imperii, which is often used for practical purposes to
                     group together certain exceptions, depending on the nature of the acts
                     involved, is far from being universally applied in a uniform manner, since the
                     categorization of certain acts under one class of acts or the other still remains





6 CIJ1031.indb 400                                                                                       22/11/13 12:25

                     298 	 jurisdictional immunities of the state (diss. op. yusuf)

                     a matter of controversy among States and national courts. Moreover, the
                     definition of the basic concept underlying the distinction, namely commercial
                     transactions, remains elusive. In the meantime, the exceptions and deroga-
                     tions to which State immunity is subject keep growing all the time.
                        26. State immunity is, as a matter of fact, as full of holes as Swiss
                     cheese. Thus, to the extent that customary norms of international law are
                     to be found in the practice and opinio juris of States, such practice clearly
                     attests to the fact that the scope and extent of State immunity, particu-
                     larly in the area of violations of human rights and humanitarian law,
                     which is currently characterized by conflicting decisions of national courts
                     in its interpretation and application, remains an uncertain and unsettled
                     area of international custom, whose contours are ill-defined.
                        27. These uncertainties cannot adequately be resolved, in my view,
                     through a formalistic exercise of surveying conflicting judicial decisions of
                     domestic courts, which remain sparse as regards human rights and
                     humanitarian law violations arising from armed conflict (or the lack of
                     reparations for such violations), and counting those in favour of applying
                     immunity and those against it. Such a process is unlikely to yield very
                     useful results or to contribute to the clarification of the law in this field.
                     Moreover, State immunity from jurisdiction cannot be interpreted in an
                     abstract manner or applied in a vacuum. The specific features and cir-
                     cumstances of each case, and the factors underlying it, have to be fully
                     taken into account. In the present case, it is claims for reparations for
                     unlawful acts admitted by the responsible State that are at issue, where no
                     alternative means of redress appear to be available. This is the reason
                     why this case is rather unusual, as recognized in the Judgment (para. 60).
                     

                        43. The law relating to State immunity has historically evolved through
                     the decisions of domestic courts. It is in such domestic courts that the
                     nature and scope of State immunity has most often been determined and
                     developed over the ages. It is to them that we owe the distinction between
                     jure gestionis and jure imperii as well as other derogations and exceptions
                     to State immunity. Divergences and conflicts in the interpretation and
                     application of the law to specific circumstances are bound to arise in such
                     a diversified setting. It is not therefore surprising that many aspects of
                     these exceptions and derogations remain unsettled.

                        44. The decisions of the Italian courts, as well as the Distomo decision
                     in Greece, may be viewed as part of a broader evolutionary process, in
                     the context of judicial decisions by domestic courts, which has given rise
                     to a number of exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of States, such
                     as the tort exception, the employment exception and the intellectual prop-
                     erty exception. The question of course may be asked whether any of these
                     exceptions should have been considered as violations of international law
                     when they were first established by one or two national courts, given the
                     unsettled nature of the scope and extent of State immunity in customary
                     international law at the time of the decision.


                       45. In this connection, it is of particular interest that the Court refers
                     approvingly to the 1961 judgment of the Supreme Court of Austria in
                     Holubek v. Government of the United States of America (ILR, Vol. 40, 1962,
                     p. 73), which may have been one of the first decisions to recognize the
                     notion of tort exception to State immunity. One could perhaps try to
                     imagine the fate of this important exception, which is now widely applied
                     and has been codified into all the existing conventions on State immunity,
                     had the Austrian judgment been found to be in violation of the law of
                     State immunity by an international judicial body in the mid-sixties. A
                     nascent norm, which has come to reflect a widely held opinio juris and
                     State practice, would have been undoubtedly nipped in the bud.

                       46. As Lord Denning commented with respect to the exception of
                     acta jure gestionis : “Whenever a change is made, someone some time has
                     to make the first move. One country alone may start the process. Others
                     may follow. At first a trickle, then a stream, last a flood.” (Quoted in
                     Brohmer, State Immunity and the Violation of Human Rights, 1997, p. 20,
                     note 85.)
                       47. Certain rules of international law may remain in a grey zone, and
                     their existence may be debated in legal scholarship, until such time as a
                     court of law — in the case of State immunities, a domestic court of law —

                     clarifies their status and establishes their legal quality. This has happened
                     many times with respect to the exceptions and derogations to State immu-
                     nity. It is not indeed through diplomatic exchanges, or through the
                     ­conclusion of conventions, or even through the pronouncements of inter-
                      national judicial or arbitral bodies that the exceptions and derogations to
                      State immunity have developed. It has most often occurred through sin-
                      gle, and sometimes isolated, domestic court decisions, which gradually
                      turned mainstream.
                         48. Thus, in the area of State immunity it is not to be excluded that
                      such domestic courts may be performing a law-development function,
                      even when their decisions are not yet shared by other jurisdictions or are
                      considered, at first sight, not to conform to what may have hitherto been
                      viewed as State practice. The Court itself appears to recognize the poten-
                      tial of domestic courts for further development of the law of immunity
                      through its references to certain judicial decisions which were the first to
                      formulate some of the derogations and exceptions to State immunity.

                        49. In his report to the Institut de droit international on “The Activi-
                     ties of National Judges and the International Relations of Their State”,
                     Professor Benedetto Conforti stated the following :
                             “In Articles 4-7 of the draft resolution, the independence of natio-
                           nal courts . . . is considered in relation to the various sources of inter-
                           national law. Beginning with customary law, it does not seem that
                           there has ever been any doubt that national courts, when they are
                           called upon to apply a customary rule, are fully independent with
                           respect to its ascertainment. There are, however, at least two aspects
                           of such ascertainment which have a rather problematic nature : one
                           concerns the court’s participation in the formation and modification
                           of customary law . . .
                             As far as the first aspect is concerned, we can say, in keeping with
                           the main trend in domestic case law, that the courts are able to review
                           whether a customary rule corresponds to the exigencies of equity and
                           justice, and if it does not, to refuse to apply it, provided that such
                           course of action has a basis in State practice, even if it is still frag-
                           mentary and at a formative stage.”

                     He then added :
                             “To conclude on this point, we can say that the judge may refuse
                           to apply an international customary norm or consider it wholly or in
                           part modified if he ascertains the existence of an opinio necessitates in
                           this sense, and if the extinction of the norm or the formation of a
                           new norm has its basis in an international and/or domestic practice,
                           even if such practice is fragmentary.” (Provisional Report, Part 2 —
                           Judicial Independence and the Sources of International Law, pp. 386-
                           387.)

                     306 	 jurisdictional immunities of the state (diss. op. yusuf)

                        50. Both the rules on State immunity and the entitlement of individu-
                     als to reparations following the commission by State agents of interna-
                     tional crimes are undergoing transformation. The Institut de droit
                     international recognized as much in its above-mentioned Naples resolu-
                     tion in which reference was made to “the underlying conflict between
                     immunity from jurisdiction of States and their agents and claims arising
                     from international crimes”. Such conflict did not exist in the past. It is of
                     recent origin. It has arisen as a result of a widely held view in the interna-
                     tional community (some sort of an opinio juris necessitates) according to
                     which State immunity should not be used as a screen to avoid reparations
                     to which victims of crimes are entitled. This is the situation in my view
                     with which the Italian “Corte di Cassazione” was faced in the Ferrini case
                     and in subsequent cases.
                        51. The assertion of jurisdiction by domestic courts for a failure to
                     make reparations for serious breaches of the law of armed conflict admit-
                     ted by the responsible State, particularly where no other means of redress
                     is available, could not, in my view, harm the independence or the sover-
                     eignty of another State. It simply contributes to the crystallization of an
                     emerging exception to State immunity, which is based on the principles
                     underlying human rights and humanitarian law and on the widely-held
                     opinio juris of ensuring the realization of those rights, including the right
                     to an effective remedy, in those circumstances where the victims would
                     have no other means of redress.

                        52. Recognizing that a failure to make reparations for war crimes or
                     crimes against humanity may result in non‑immunity before domestic
                     courts, particularly when no other means of redress is available, is not so
                     much about further narrowing the scope of State immunity, but about
                     bringing it in line with the growing normative weight attached by the
                     international community to the protection of human rights and humani-
                     tarian law, and the realization of the right to effective remedy for human
                     beings. It could also have a deterrent effect on the non-observance of
                     humanitarian law by States.

                        53. I am not sure that it is sufficient to state, in the context of the
                     exceptional circumstances surrounding the claims of the Italian victims
                     for reparations, that : “the fact that immunity may bar the exercise of
                     jurisdiction in a particular case does not alter the applicability of the sub-
                     stantive rules of international law” (Judgment, para. 100). A question
                     that may arise, in this context, is whether, if immunity were granted in
                     such a case, the defendant State would be under an obligation to afford
                     an alternative remedy to the victims of the breaches to which it has admit-
                     ted ? This is an important question to which an answer should have been
                     provided in the proceedings or in the Judgment. Moreover, it is doubtful
                     whether a responsibility that does not afford a means of redress or a
                     remedial context within which the claims may be settled can be of much
                     use to such victims.

                       56. The core issue in this dispute was not that in each and every case of
                     an alleged violation of human rights or humanitarian law, immunity
                     should be derogated from, or that there is, generally speaking, a
                     human rights or humanitarian law exception to jurisdictional immunity.
                     The core issue was whether, in those exceptional circumstances where
                     immunity may prevent the victims of international crimes from obtaining
                     an effective remedy or where no other means of redress is available, such
                     immunity should be granted or set aside by domestic courts. In other
                     words, where reparation has not been assigned to another contextual
                     remedy, should immunity be used as a screen to ward off the obligation
                     to make reparations to the victims before domestic courts ?

                     308 	 jurisdictional immunities of the state (diss. op. yusuf)

                       57. I believe that, in such a case, by lifting the bar of immunity in the
                     very limited way suggested above (paras. 49‑54 supra), humanitarian law
                     would be better enforced and the human rights-based values of the inter-
                     national community as a whole would be better protected.

                        58. As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court
                     has an important role to play to provide guidance on rules of interna-
                     tional law and to clarify them, particularly where the law is uncertain or
                     unsettled. It had a unique opportunity to do so in this case. It could have
                     clarified the law in the sense in which it is already evolving of a limited
                     and workable exception to jurisdictional immunity in those circumstances
                     where the victims have no other means of redress. Such an exception
                     would bring immunity in line with the growing normative weight attached
                     by the international community to the protection of human rights and
                     humanitarian law, and the realization of the right to effective remedy for
                     victims of international crimes, without unjustifiably indenting the juris-
                     dictional immunity of States.

                        59. The assertion of jurisdiction by domestic courts in those excep-
                     tional circumstances where there is a failure to make reparations, and
                     where the responsible State has admitted to the commission of serious
                     violations of humanitarian law, without providing a contextual remedy
                     for the victims, does not, in my view, upset the harmonious relations
                     between States, but contributes to a better observance of international
                     human rights and humanitarian law.
