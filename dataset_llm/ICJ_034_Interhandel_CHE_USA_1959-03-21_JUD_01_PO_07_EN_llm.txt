Being to my regret unable to concur in the Court’s decision on
Objections Nos. 3 and 4 (a), I think it is my duty to set forth the
reasons for my dissenting opinion.


1. The Third Objection is founded upon the rule of the exhaus-
tion of local remedies. It is not included as a qualification of the
American declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Court; it is invoked as a general principle of international law,
The plea is an objection to the admissibility of the Application;
it contests that admissibility only and is not directed against the
Court’s jurisdiction. The rule of the exhaustion of local remedies
does not affect the jurisdiction of the Court, which may be compe-
tent, even if internal remedies have not been exhausted. Accord-
ingly, the question of the admissibility of the Application lies out-
side the field of jurisdiction. In its Judgment in the Corfu Channel
case this Court admitted the distinction between admissibility and
jurisdiction (I.C.J. Reports 1947-1948, pp. 26-27); in other cases it
has said that the exhaustion of the remedies is an argument in
defence directed to the admissibility of ithe claim (I.C.J. Reports
1952, p. 114, and 1953, p. 23). The present judgment reaches the
same conclusion. The Permanent Court had upheld the same con-
tention. Therefore the Court cannot adjudicate on the admissibility
of the Application until it has established its jurisdiction (Series
A/B, No. 67, p. 24).

3. The principle of the exhaustion of local remedies is not absolute
and rigid; it has to be applied flexibly according to the case. Some
situations or facts may entitle the Court to accede to a request,
even if the remedies have not been completely exhausted.

A limit is placed upon the rule of exhaustion if the period within
which the remedies will be exhausted is not known. The Permanent
Court acknowledged this limitation in its Order of February 4th,
1933, in the Prince von Pless case, on the grounds of an unwarrant-
able delay by the Polish tribunal, and the Court decided not to
adjudicate upon the applicability of the principle of exhausting
local remedies (Series A/B, No. 52, p. 16).

4. The substance of the Interhandel claim is to obtain from the
American courts the restitution and the taking immediate posses-
sion of the vested shares and the handing over by the defendants
to the claimant of all dividends and interest pertaining thereto.
This claim is founded in law on the fifth amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States and the amended law of October 6th,
1917, relating to trading with the enemy. The Application of the
Swiss Government in its final submission A, requests the Court to
adjudge and declare that the Government of the United States
of America is under an obligation to restore the assets of Interhandel ;
it takes its stand upon Article IV of the Washington Accord and
on the principle of international law which forbids the confiscation
of neutral property. The two claims, that of Interhandel and that
of the Swiss Government, are based upon different legal grounds.

mence at once trial on the merits. We decide only that on this record dismissal
of the complaint with prejudice was not justified.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded
to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this Opinion.
It is so ordered.”

It is seen therefore that the District Court may select alternatives or different
expedients. .

! The Swiss Government is not acting in the present dispute as the represent-
ative of its national; the reparation claimed is not of the same legal character as
that asked for by its national and the damage suffered by Switzerland is not iden-
tical with that incurred by Interhandel. The Permanent Court examined these
questions very carefully in its Judgment (Series A, No. 17, pp. 27-28), as follows:

“It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may
consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of


INTERHANDEL (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE ARMAND-UGON) 88

The Interhandel claim seeks to obtain by methods of local redress
a decision by the American courts that the (in Interhandel’s opinion)
unlawful act of vesting is a violation of domestic law, whilst the
Application of the Swiss Government is based upon damage caused
by the breach of an international agreement and of the law of na-
tions. It is not known whether, at this stage of the proceedings,
Interhandel could or could not pursue its claim before the American
courts and introduce there the legal grounds relied upon by the
Swiss Government with a view to the claim being decided by the
American courts. That would be a modification of Interhandel’s
claim and it would have to be ascertained whether American proce-
dure permits such action. The Supreme Court of the United States,
in its decision of June 16th, 1958, reversing the earlier decision in
the Interhandel case, makes no allusion in its directives to the
District Court to the questions of international law which, accord-
ing to the Application of the Swiss Government, constitute the
subject-matter of the dispute. According to the American Agent,
the courts could examine that case. On the other hand, the Swiss
Agent says that it would be impossible. This difference of opinion
turns mainly upon the question of the application by the national
courts of the Washington Accord in its character of Executive
Agreement, a treaty which, not having been approved by Congress,
is not incorporated in United States domestic law.

5. Even if such action proved to be possible, it would still have
to be borne in mind that the Swiss Government is not a party to the
dispute before the American courts. It would therefore seem that
the local remedies sought in those courts might not afford a final
redress to satisfy the case put forward by the Swiss Government.
‘Where a question of international law is involved, only an inter-
national court can give a final decision.

6. The Permanent Court was very cautious in upholding an
objection based upon the local remedies rule and was in no hurry
to relinquish its jurisdiction. In three cases it joined the objection
to the merits (Series A/B, No. 54, Series A/B, No. 67, and Series
A/B, No. 75); it upheld the objection in one case (Series A/B,
No. 76) as a defence on the merits; in another case (Series A/B,
No. 77) the Court accepted it on the basis of a treaty clause. The
same objection was dismissed in two cases (Series A, No. 6, and
Series A, No. g). The present Court also dismissed it in the Amba-
tielos case. (I.C.J. Reports 1953, pp. 18, 22 and 23.)

This is therefore the first time that the Court is upholding,
without joining it to the merits, a preliminary objection based
upon the rule of exhaustion of local remedies and not included
in the Declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the Court. The
judicial precedents mentioned should not have been abandoned.

7. In its examination of the preliminary objections the Court
has to avoid prejudging matters relating to the merits of the
dispute, particularly when the questions raised, whether of fact
or of law, show that the parties are in disagreement and when these
questions are closely linked to the merits. Any such encroachment
upon the merits of the dispute deprives the parties of the right given
them by the Statute and Rules of Court to submit written pleadings
and make oral statements on the merits of the dispute (Series A/B,
No. 67, p. 24).

8. The Permanent Court laid down wise directives when the
objection on grounds of non-exhaustion of local remedies touches
upon the merits. In its decision (Series A/B, No. 75, p. 55) it
said:

“Whereas, at the present stage of the proceedings, a decision
cannot be taken either as to. the preliminary character of the
objections or on the question whether they are.well founded, and
any such decision would raise questions of fact and law in regard
to which the Parties are in several respects in disagreement and
which are too closely linked to the merits for the Court to adjudicate
upon them at the present stage;

Whereas, in view of the said disagreement between the Parties,
the Court must have exact information as to the legal contentions
respectively adduced by the Parties and the arguments in support
of these contentions;

Whereas the Court may order the joinder of preliminary ob-
jections to the merits, whenever the interests of the good admin-
istration of justice require it.”

For these reasons, at the present stage of the proceedings, it
seems that the Third Objection to the Swiss principal submission
should rightly and reasonably have been joined to the merits.

3. The Declaration of the United States made under Article 36,
paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court provides that the Declara-
tion shall not apply to: “(b) disputes with regard to matters which
are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States
of America as determined by the United States of America”.

The last part of paragraph (8) of the United States reservation
lays down that the United States of America will determine whether
a dispute submitted to the Court relates to questions which lie
within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States of America.
The clause “as determined by the United States of America”, as
applied in the present case, is incompatible with paragraph 6 of
Article 36 of the Statute, which says: “In the event of a dispute as
to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled
by the decision of the Court.”

“Paragraph 6 of Article 36—the Court has maintained—merely
adopted a rule consistently accepted by general international law
in the matter of international arbitration.” (Nottebohm case, Prelimi-
nary Objection, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 119.) And a little later the
Court further emphasizes: “But even if this were not the case, the
Court, ‘whose function is to decide in accordance with international
law such disputes as are submitted to it’ (Article 38, paragraph I,
of the Statute), should follow in this connection what is laid down
by general international law. The judicial character of the Court
and the rule of general international law referred to above are
sufficient to establish that the Court is competent to adjudicate on
its own jurisdiction in the present case.” ([bid., p. 120.)

6. The Parties to a dispute cannot depart from the Statute of the
Court unilaterally or by agreement between themselves. The Per-
manent Court had occasion to adjudicate on this latter point. In
the Free Zones case the parties had agreed in their Special Agree-
ment to request the Court to let them know unofficially the content
of its deliberations before delivering judgment. That request was
refused as contrary to Articles 54, paragraph 3 (Secrecy of Deliber-
ations), and 58 (Reading of Judgment in open Court) of the Statute.
The same Court declared in its Order of August 19th, 1929: “In
contradistinction to that which is permitted by the Rules (Arti-
cle 32), the Court cannot, on the proposal of the parties, depart
from the terms of the Statute.”

Another instance may be given: a declaration of the parties
whereby they do not consider themselves bound by the Court’s
judgment, cannot be allowed, being contrary to Article 59 of the
Statute (Series A/B, No. 46, p. 161). The rules of substance and
procedure fixed by the Statute must be regarded as immutable:
neither the Court nor the parties can break them.

7. Since the reservation in regard to paragraph 6 of Article 36
contained in (b) of the American Declaration (‘as determined”,
etc.) is obviously contrary to that paragraph, and cannot be linked
to the application of any text in the Statute, the Court should
regard it as unwritten and inoperative in the present case. That is
to say, the respondent Government cannot rely upon it in support
of its Objection 4 (a). The clause in question, not being provided for
in any part of the Statute, should be declared without effect vis-à-
vis the Court.

Consequently, this objection 4 (a) should be dismissed and the
jurisdiction of the Court upheld.
