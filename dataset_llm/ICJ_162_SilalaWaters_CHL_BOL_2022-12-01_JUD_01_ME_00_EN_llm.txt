       32. By 1999, the question of the status of the Silala and the character of its waters had become
a point of contention between the Parties. In particular, on 3 September 1999, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Bolivia addressed a diplomatic Note to the Consulate General of Chile in La Paz
contending that, despite the annulment in 1997 by Bolivia of the concession granted to the FCAB in
1908 to exploit the spring waters of the Silala, the company persisted in its use of those waters. The
Ministry added that the matter was one that remained in the private sphere and was, as such, under
Bolivia’s jurisdiction. The Ministry moreover asserted that the spring waters of the Silala, which
were entirely located in Bolivian territory, created wetlands, from where the waters were conducted
by means of artificial works, “generating a system that lack[ed] any characteristic of a river, let alone
of an international river of a successive course”.


       37. Chile indicates that it decided to request a judgment from the Court on “the nature of the
Silala River as an international watercourse and of Chile’s rights as a riparian State”, following
several statements made by the President of Bolivia, Mr. Evo Morales, in 2016, in which he accused
Chile of illegally exploiting the waters of the Silala without compensating Bolivia, stated that the
Silala was “not an international river” and expressed an intention to bring the dispute before the
Court. Chile accordingly instituted proceedings against Bolivia before the Court on 6 June 2016 (see
paragraph 1 above).


       38. As mentioned above (see paragraph 24), during the oral proceedings, Chile produced a
new document, referred to as “Draft Agreement of 2019”, which it had submitted to Bolivia in
June 2019 as a new proposal aimed at bringing the dispute over the Silala to an end. According to
Chile, the proposal received no reply from Bolivia.

Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá. That provision reads:

            “In conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International
      Court of Justice, the High Contracting Parties declare that they recognize in relation to
      any other American State, the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory ipso facto, without
      the necessity of any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in force, in all
      disputes of a juridical nature that arise among them concerning:

      (a) [t]he interpretation of a treaty;

      (b) [a]ny question of international law;

      (c) [t]he existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute the breach of an
          international obligation;

      (d) [t]he nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international
          obligation.”

The existence of a dispute between the Parties is a condition of the Court’s jurisdiction under
Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá. A dispute is “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict

Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá provides the Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute
between them. The only exception is Chile’s assertion that the Court lacks jurisdiction in respect of
Bolivia’s first counter-claim. Leaving aside this objection, which will be addressed below (see
Section IV), the Court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the Parties.

                                                 - 21 -

      40. The Court observes that some positions of the Parties have evolved considerably during
the course of the proceedings. Each Party now contends that certain claims or counter-claims of the
other Party are without object or present hypothetical questions and are thus to be rejected. Before
examining the claims and counter-claims of the Parties, the Court makes some general observations
with respect to these assertions.


       41. The Court recalls that, even if it finds that it has jurisdiction, “[t]here are inherent
limitations on the exercise of the judicial function which the Court, as a court of justice, can never
ignore” (Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 29; see also Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2013, p. 69, para. 45). The Court has emphasized that “[t]he dispute brought before it must . . .
continue to exist at the time when the Court makes its decision” and that “there is nothing on which

I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 95, para. 66). Such a situation may cause the Court to “deci[de] not to proceed
to judgment on the merits” (Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.
Belgium), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, pp. 12-13, para. 26; see also Fisheries Jurisdiction
(Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, pp. 467-468, para. 88).


       42. The Court has held “that it cannot adjudicate upon the merits of the claim” when it
considers that “any adjudication [would be] devoid of purpose” (Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v.
United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 38). The Court
observes that its task is not limited to determining whether a dispute has disappeared in its entirety.
The scope of a dispute brought before the Court is circumscribed by the claims submitted to it by the
parties. Therefore, in the present case, the Court also has to ascertain whether specific claims have
become without object as a consequence of a convergence of positions or agreement between the
Parties, or for some other reason.


       43. To this end, the Court will carefully assess whether and to what extent the final submissions
of the Parties continue to reflect a dispute between them. The Court has no power to “substitute itself
for [the parties] and formulate new submissions simply on the basis of arguments and facts advanced”
(Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Merits, Judgment, No. 7, 1926, P.C.I.J., Series A,
No. 7, p. 35). However, it is “entitled to interpret the submissions of the parties, and in fact is bound
to do so; this is one of the attributes of its judicial functions” (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France),
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 262, para. 29). In undertaking this task, the Court will take into
account not only the submissions, but also, inter alia, the Application as well as all the arguments
put forward by the Parties in the course of the written and oral proceedings (see ibid., p. 263,
paras. 30-31). The Court will thus interpret the submissions, in order to identify their substance and
to determine whether they reflect a dispute between the Parties.


       44. Each Party maintains that certain submissions of the other Party, while reflecting points of
convergence between the Parties, remain vague, ambiguous or conditional, and therefore cannot be
taken to express agreement between them. Each has therefore requested the Court to render a
declaratory judgment with respect to certain submissions, pointing to the need for legal certainty in
their mutual relations. The Applicant emphasized the need for a declaratory judgment to prevent the
Respondent from changing its position in the future on the law applicable to international
watercourses and to the Silala.

                                                 - 22 -

       45. The Court notes that “[i]t is clear in the jurisprudence of the Court and its predecessor that
‘the Court may, in an appropriate case, make a declaratory judgment’” (Application of the Interim
Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2011 (II), p. 662, para. 49, citing Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. United
Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 37). The Court further recalls
that the purpose of a declaratory judgment

      “is to ensure recognition of a situation at law, once and for all and with binding force as
      between the Parties; so that the legal position thus established cannot again be called in
      question in so far as the legal effects ensuing therefrom are concerned” (Interpretation
      of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (Factory at Chorzów), Judgment No. 11, 1927, P.C.I.J.,
      Series A, No. 13, p. 20).


       46. Given that the Court’s role in a contentious case is to resolve existing disputes, the
operative paragraph of a judgment should not, in principle, record points on which the Court finds
the parties to be in agreement (see Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2013, pp. 71-73, paras. 53-59). Statements made by the parties before the Court must be presumed
to be made in good faith. The Court carefully assesses such statements. If the Court finds that the
parties have come to agree in substance regarding a claim or a counter-claim, it will take note of that
agreement in its judgment and conclude that such a claim or counter-claim has become without
object. In such a case, there is no call for a declaratory judgment.


      47. The Court notes that, in the present case, many submissions are closely interrelated.
A conclusion that a particular claim or counter-claim is without object does not preclude the Court
from addressing certain questions that are relevant to such a claim or counter-claim in the course of
examining other claims or counter-claims that remain to be decided.


       48. The Court further recalls that its function is “to state the law, but it may pronounce
judgment only in connection with concrete cases where there exists at the time of the adjudication
an actual controversy involving a conflict of legal interests between the parties” (Northern
Cameroons (Cameroon v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963,
pp. 33-34; Question of the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia
beyond 200 Nautical Miles from the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 138, para. 123). The Court reaffirms that “it is not
for the Court to determine the applicable law with regard to a hypothetical situation” (ibid). In
particular, it has held that it does not pronounce “on any hypothetical situation which might arise in
the future” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1974, p. 32, para. 73).


      49. In assessing the Parties’ claims and counter-claims, the Court will be guided by the above
considerations.

                                        III. CLAIMS OF CHILE

                  1. Submission (a): the Silala River system as an international
                      watercourse governed by customary international law

       50. In its submission (a), Chile asks the Court to adjudge and declare that “[t]he Silala River
system, together with the subterranean portions of its system, is an international watercourse, the use
of which is governed by customary international law”. Chile maintains that the definition of
“international watercourse” contained in Article 2 (a) and (b) of the 1997 Convention on the Law of
the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (hereinafter referred to as the “1997
Convention”) reflects customary international law and that the Silala waters, irrespective of their
“natural” or “artificial” character, qualify as an international watercourse. Chile further maintains
that the customary international law rules applicable to international watercourses apply to the Silala
waters in their entirety.


       51. Chile’s position with respect to submission (a) has remained unchanged throughout the
proceedings. While acknowledging that “Bolivia has belatedly accepted” that submission (a) “is true
to an extent”, Chile maintains that the Parties continue to disagree on its submission (a).



                                                    *

international watercourse under customary international law. Bolivia also contested that the
definition of the term “international watercourse” contained in Article 2 of the 1997 Convention
reflects customary international law as far as the artificially enhanced parts of the Silala waters are
concerned. Bolivia further argued that the rules of customary international law applicable to
international watercourses only apply to the natural flow of watercourses.


       53. During the oral proceedings, Bolivia acknowledged  referring to the findings by the
experts appointed by each Party  that the Silala waters, including those parts that are artificially
enhanced, qualify as an international watercourse. Bolivia now also recognizes that the customary
international law applicable to the non-navigational uses of international watercourses applies to the
entirety of the Silala waters. Bolivia concludes that the dispute between the Parties with respect to
Chile’s submission (a) has disappeared in the course of the oral proceedings. On this basis Bolivia
requests the Court, in its final submissions, to reject Chile’s submission (a) for absence of a dispute
and, “[t]o the extent that the Court were to consider that there is still a dispute between the Parties,
to adjudge and declare that: (a) [t]he waters of the Silala constitute an international watercourse
whose surface flow has been artificially enhanced”.



                                                *       *

                                                 - 24 -

       54. The Court observes at the outset that neither Chile nor Bolivia is party to the 1997
Convention or to any treaty governing the non-navigational uses of the Silala River. Accordingly, in
the present case, the respective rights and obligations of the Parties are governed by customary
international law.


       55. The Court notes that Chile’s submission (a) contains the legal propositions that the Silala
waters are an international watercourse under customary international law, and that the customary
international law rules relating to international watercourses apply to the Silala waters in their
entirety. The Court observes that the legal position originally taken by Bolivia in its Counter-
Memorial positively opposed both legal propositions advanced by Chile. In particular, Bolivia
contested that the rules on the non-navigational uses of international watercourses under customary
international law apply to the “artificially enhanced” surface flow of the Silala.


       56. The Court observes that the positions of the Parties with respect to the legal status of the
Silala waters and the rules applicable under customary international law have converged in the course
of the proceedings. During the oral proceedings, Bolivia has on several occasions expressed its
agreement with Chile’s claim that  despite the “artificial enhancement” of the surface flow of the
Silala River  the Silala waters qualify in their entirety as an international watercourse under
customary international law and stated that, therefore, customary international law applies both to
the “naturally flowing” waters and the “artificially enhanced” surface flow of the Silala.


        57. The Court notes that Bolivia, while recognizing that the Silala waters qualify as an
international watercourse, does not consider Article 2 of the 1997 Convention to reflect customary
international law. The Court also notes that Bolivia maintains that the “unique characteristics” of the
Silala, including the fact that parts of its surface flow are “artificially enhanced”, have to be taken
into account when applying the customary rules on international watercourses to the Silala waters.
In its final submissions Bolivia thus asks the Court to reject Chile’s submission and, if it does not do
so, to find that the surface flow of the Silala has been “artificially enhanced”.


       58. For the purpose of determining whether Bolivia agrees with the position of Chile regarding
the legal status of the Silala as an international watercourse under customary international law, the
Court does not consider it necessary for Bolivia to have recognized that the definition contained in
Article 2 of the 1997 Convention reflects customary international law. Furthermore, Bolivia’s
insistence on the relevance of the “unique characteristics” of the Silala waters in the application of
the rules of customary international law does not change the fact that it has expressed its unequivocal
agreement with the proposition that the customary international law on non-navigational uses of
international watercourses applies to all of the Silala waters. In this regard, the Court takes note of
Bolivia’s response to a question put by one of its Judges during the oral proceedings in which Bolivia
confirmed “the Silala’s nature as an international watercourse independent of its undisputable special
characteristics, which have no bearing on the existing customary rules”, and emphasized that it “has
not attached any conditions or restrictions to its acceptance of the application of customary law”. The
Court takes note of Bolivia’s acceptance of the substance of Chile’s submission (a).

             2. Submission (b): Chile’s entitlement to the equitable and reasonable
                      utilization of the waters of the Silala River system

       60. In its submission (b), Chile asks the Court to adjudge and declare that “Chile is entitled to
the equitable and reasonable utilization of the waters of the Silala River system in accordance with
customary international law”. Chile maintains that its entitlement to the waters of the Silala under
the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization is not affected by the fact that parts of the flow
of the Silala are “artificially enhanced”.


       61. Chile’s position with respect to submission (b) has remained unchanged throughout the
proceedings. In support of its final submission, Chile confirms that, in its view, Bolivia is equally
entitled to equitable and reasonable use of the waters of the Silala. Chile also maintains that, contrary
to Bolivia’s allegations, it has never contested Bolivia’s entitlement. Chile requests the Court to
adjudicate on its submission (b) in order to ensure legal certainty between the two States.



                                                    *



       62. Bolivia’s position with respect to Chile’s submission (b) has evolved in the course of the
proceedings. In its Counter-Memorial, Bolivia claimed that the principle of equitable and reasonable
utilization only applies to the “naturally flowing” parts of the Silala waters. Bolivia further
maintained that the use of “artificial flows” of the Silala waters by Chile depends on Bolivia’s
consent. Bolivia emphasized that, with respect to the “naturally flowing” parts of the Silala, both
Parties are entitled to the equitable and reasonable use of the water under customary international
law, and that Chile’s claim should be dismissed to the extent that it only concerns Chile’s rights and
disregards Bolivia’s rights.


      63. During the oral proceedings, Bolivia acknowledged that the right to equitable and
reasonable use of the waters of the Silala covers the entirety of the waters. In its view, any dispute
between the Parties concerning Chile’s submission (b) now only concerns the “nuance” that,
according to Bolivia, both Parties are entitled to equitable and reasonable utilization. On this basis,
Bolivia requests the Court, in its final submissions,

      “[t]o the extent that the Court were to consider that there is still a dispute between the
      Parties, to adjudge and declare that: . . . [u]nder the rules of customary international law
      on the use of international watercourses that apply to the Silala, Bolivia and Chile are
      each entitled to an equitable and reasonable utilization of the Silala waters”.



                                                *       *

                                                  - 26 -

        64. The Court observes that, when these proceedings were instituted, Chile’s claim regarding
its entitlement to the equitable and reasonable use of the waters of the Silala, which includes both the
“naturally flowing” and “artificially enhanced” parts, was positively opposed by Bolivia. During the
course of the proceedings, however, it became apparent that the Parties agree that the principle of
equitable and reasonable utilization applies to the entirety of the waters of the Silala, irrespective of
their “natural” or “artificial” character. The Parties also agree that they are both entitled to the
equitable and reasonable utilization of the Silala waters under customary international law. It is not
for the Court to address a possible difference of opinion regarding a future use of these waters that
is entirely hypothetical (see paragraphs 44 and 48 above).


       65. For these reasons, the Court finds that the Parties agree with respect to Chile’s
submission (b). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the claim made by Chile in its final
submission (b) no longer has any object and that, therefore, the Court is not called upon to give a
decision thereon.


                      3. Submission (c): Chile’s entitlement to its current use
                             of the waters of the Silala River system

       66. In its submission (c), Chile asks the Court to adjudge and declare that “[u]nder the standard
of equitable and reasonable utilization, Chile is entitled to its current utilization of the waters of the
Silala River”. Chile claims that its past and present use of the Silala waters is consistent with the
principle of equitable and reasonable utilization. Pointing to the absence of countervailing uses by
Bolivia, Chile argues that, as the downstream riparian State, all its past and present use of the flow
that crosses the boundary from Bolivia to Chile is equitable and reasonable vis-à-vis Bolivia.


       67. Chile’s submission (c) has remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. Chile asks
the Court to confirm that the principle of equitable and reasonable use applies to all the waters of the
Silala and that this principle does not leave room for a right to claim compensation for past or future
uses of the Silala. In response to Bolivia’s interpretation of Chile’s submission (c) as claiming a right
to maintain the “current rate and volume of water flow”, Chile emphasizes that this interpretation
represents a mischaracterization of its submission. Chile notes that it does not ask the Court to
recognize an acquired right, an entitlement to maintain the status quo or a title to a certain amount of
water, but rather that it seeks a declaration that its current use of the waters conforms with the
principle of equitable and reasonable utilization, without prejudice to any of Bolivia’s rights and the
future use of the waters by both States. Chile also points out that Bolivia has “taken note” of Chile’s
indication that it “does not seek to obtain any pre-judgment as to what future use of the Silala River
may be equitable and reasonable and likewise does not seek in any way to freeze further development
and use of the waters so far as concerns either State”. Chile nevertheless maintains that the above-
mentioned declaration that it seeks from the Court would ensure legal certainty in the relations
between the Parties given the changes in Bolivia’s position.


        68. Bolivia’s position with respect to Chile’s submission (c) has evolved during the
proceedings. In its Counter-Memorial, Bolivia asked the Court to adjudge and declare that “Bolivia
and Chile are each entitled to the equitable and reasonable utilization of the naturally flowing Silala
waters, in accordance with customary international law” and that “[t]he current use of the naturally-
flowing Silala waters by Chile is without prejudice to Bolivia’s right to an equitable and reasonable
use of these waters”. Bolivia emphasized that any use of the waters by Chile is limited by Bolivia’s
exclusive rights over the artificial flow of Silala waters. Bolivia also stated that it understood Chile’s
submission (c) as requesting the Court to declare that Chile has a right to maintain the current rate
and volume of water flow from Bolivia to Chile which should not be subject to future modification.
In its view, such a position would be incompatible with Bolivia’s equal right to its own equitable and
reasonable share of the naturally flowing waters of the Silala, as well as its exclusive rights over the
artificial flow of Silala waters.


       69. During the oral proceedings, Bolivia acknowledged that the right to equitable and
reasonable use applies to the Silala waters in their entirety (see paragraph 63 above). Bolivia now
claims that Chile’s past use of all the waters of the Silala should be taken into account to determine
Bolivia’s future right to an equitable and reasonable use of the waters. Bolivia further points to the
ambiguous formulation of Chile’s submission (c) and what it considers to be contradictory statements
made by the representatives of Chile in the proceedings before the Court as to the correct
interpretation to be given to this submission. According to Bolivia, it is thus unclear whether Chile
is prepared to accept unconditionally the risks ensuing from a possible dismantling of the channels
and installations (see paragraph 27 above), whatever the scale of the reduction caused in the Silala’s
surface flow. On this basis, Bolivia, in its final submissions, requests “[t]o the extent that the Court
were to consider that there is still a dispute between the Parties, to adjudge and declare that: . . .
Chile’s current use of the waters of the Silala is without prejudice to Bolivia’s right to an equitable
and reasonable use of these waters”.



                                                *      *



        70. The Court notes that, when these proceedings were instituted, Chile’s claim to be entitled
to its current use of the waters of the Silala was positively opposed by Bolivia as far as it concerned
those parts of the flow which Bolivia describes as “artificially enhanced”.


       71. Considering the statements made by Bolivia during the oral proceedings, the Court also
notes that the Parties agree that Chile has a right to the use of an equitable and reasonable share of
the waters of the Silala irrespective of the “natural” or “artificial” character or origin of the water
flow (see paragraph 69 above). Furthermore, Bolivia does not claim in these proceedings that Chile
owes compensation to Bolivia for past uses of the waters of the Silala.


      72. The Court observes that the formulation of submission (c) does not, by itself, clearly
indicate whether Chile asks the Court only to declare that its current use of the waters of the Silala is
in conformity with the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization, or whether Chile requests
the Court to declare, in addition, that it has a right to receive the same rate of flow and volume of the

                                                  - 28 -

waters in the future. In this respect, the Court takes note of several statements made by Chile during
the later stages of the proceedings in which it emphasized that submission (c) only seeks a declaration
to the effect that the present use of the waters of the Silala is in conformity with the principle of
equitable and reasonable utilization and that its entitlement to any future use is without prejudice to
that of Bolivia. Moreover, Chile has underlined, on several occasions, that its right to equitable and
reasonable use would not per se be infringed by the reduction of the flow subsequent to a dismantling
of the channels and installations.


      73. The Court considers that the clarification brought about by these statements is not called
into question by references, in Chile’s written and oral pleadings, to the general duty of Bolivia not
to breach its obligations under customary international law, should it decide to proceed to a
dismantling of the channels. In the Court’s view, these references do not qualify the substance of
Chile’s statements but simply recall the general duty of States to act in compliance with their
obligations under international law.


       74. Regarding Bolivia’s contention that Chile’s use is without prejudice to Bolivia’s future
uses of the Silala, the Court reaffirms that there is no opposition of views regarding a corresponding
right of Bolivia to the equitable and reasonable use of the Silala waters, as Chile does not deny
Bolivia’s proposition in this regard (see paragraphs 61 and 64 above).


       75. For these reasons, the Court finds that the Parties have, in the course of the proceedings,

       76. Since the Parties agree regarding Chile’s submission (c), the Court concludes that the claim
made by Chile in its final submission (c) no longer has any object and that, therefore, the Court is
not called upon to give a decision thereon.


      4. Submission (d): Bolivia’s obligation to prevent and control harm resulting from
                     its activities in the vicinity of the Silala River system

       77. In its submission (d), Chile asks the Court to adjudge and declare that “Bolivia has an
obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution and other forms of harm
to Chile resulting from its activities in the vicinity of the Silala River”. Chile argues that “Bolivia is
under an obligation to co-operate and prevent transboundary harm to the utilization of the waters of
the Silala River system in Chile”. It claims that “States sharing an international watercourse are under
an obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other
watercourse States. This rule of international law is enshrined in Article 7 of the [1997 Convention].”
Chile also emphasizes that it does

      “not ask the Court to specify precisely what measures Bolivia must take in order to give
      full effect to Article 7 of the [1997 Convention]. Rather, it asks the [C]ourt to reaffirm
      that Bolivia has an obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent and control
      pollution and other forms of harm to Chile resulting from activities in the vicinity of the
      Silala River.”

       78. Chile’s submission (d) has remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. During the
oral proceedings, Chile confirmed its position that both Parties are bound by the obligation to prevent
significant transboundary harm. In Chile’s view, this obligation encompasses the duty to notify and
exchange information, as well as the duty to conduct an environmental impact assessment.

       79. Bolivia’s position with respect to Chile’s submission (d) has evolved in the course of the
proceedings. In its Counter-Memorial, Bolivia maintained that the law of international watercourses,
including its obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm under customary international law
as reflected in Article 7 of the 1997 Convention, only applies to the naturally flowing waters of the
Silala. During the oral proceedings, Bolivia recognized that the obligation not to cause significant
transboundary harm applies to all the waters of the Silala irrespective of whether they flow naturally
or are “artificially enhanced”.


       80. Bolivia maintains its position that the “no significant harm” principle applies only to
significant environmental harms and not, as Chile alleges, “to ‘prevent[ing] and control[ling]
pollution and other forms of harm’ without qualifications”. Bolivia also stresses that both Parties
have an obligation of conduct not to cause significant harm to the other riparian State. In its view,
this obligation entails that a riparian State shall conduct an environmental impact assessment if it
considers that there is a risk of significant harm. If the risk is confirmed, the State shall, according to
Bolivia, notify the other Party.


      81. On this basis, Bolivia now maintains that a dispute no longer exists in respect of
submission (d). In its final submission, Bolivia requests “[t]o the extent that the Court were to
consider that there is still a dispute between the Parties, to adjudge and declare that: . . . Bolivia and
Chile each have an obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant
transboundary harm in the Silala”.
