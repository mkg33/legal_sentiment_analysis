1. Because of the importance of the Judgment from the standpoint of its
consequences for the law applicable to the delimitation of maritime spaces,
1 believe it necessary that I should set forth the grounds of my dissent.

2. The Parties have submitted to the Chamber some 7,600 pages of
pleadings and 2,000 pages of oral arguments together with 300 supporting
maps, sketches or diagrams — more than 12 metres of shelving is taken up
by the volumes deposited in the library by the Parties ; yet no clear position
regarding the essential legal problems arising in this case emerges from this
mass of material. Thus the problems of the single boundary, of the law
applicable to the present case, of equity, of the exact role of geography,
have been examined in great detail but with a certain lack of precision
and some self-contradictions, accompanied frequently by the use of cate-
gorical formulae or assertions presented as rules or principles of law.
One is reminded of Mr. Justice Holmes’ warning about the relativity
of words :

“A word... is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in
color and content according to the circumstances and the time in
which it is used.” (245 U.S. 418, 425.)

In the course of the present proceedings, the Parties and the Chamber
have each referred to judicial decisions in support of their legal reasoning,
but frequently a judicial text has been quoted without anything to indicate
that colour and content have in fact changed. The present must however be
seen in its own true colours : the jurisprudence of the subject is no longer
viewed as in 1969 and 1977, but has taken a sudden turn of which due note
must be taken, and the Judgment of the Chamber takes its place within this
change.

3. International law has been evolving since, in its Judgment of 18
December 1951, the Court first signalled the economic importance of
certain situations in the determination of a maritime boundary, in the
following five lines of a 26-page Judgment :

“Finally, there is one consideration not to be overlooked, the scope
of which extends beyond purely geographical factors : that of certain
economic interests peculiar to a region, the reality and importance of
which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.” (I.C.J. Reports 1951,
p- 133)



The opposite viewpoint was stated in the dissenting opinion of Judge Sir
Arnold McNair :

“Norway has sought to justify the Decree of 1935 on a variety of
grounds, of which the principal are the following (A, B, C and D):

(A) That a State has a right to-delimit its territorial waters in the
manner required to protect its economic and other social interests.
This is a novelty to me. It reveals one of the fundamental issues which
divide the Parties, namely, the difference between the subjective and
the objective views of the delimitation of territorial waters.

In my opinion the manipulation of the limits of territorial waters for
the purpose of protecting economic and other social interests has no
justification in law ; moreover, the approbation of such a practice
would have a dangerous tendency in that it would encourage States to
adopt a subjective appreciation of their rights instead of conforming
to a common international standard.” (I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 169.)

During the Conferences of 1958 and 1960, the idea of a contiguous
fishing zone lying close to the coastline of a State began to take shape, but
in the years which followed it was the continental shelf which came to the
fore. On this, the Court’s Judgment of 20 February 1969 in the North Sea
Continental Shelf cases (I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 4-56, hereinafter referred
to as the 1969 Judgment), and the Decision of the Court of Arbitration
between the United Kingdom and France dated 30 June 1977 (Cmnd
7438 ; hereinafter referred to as the 1977 Decision) constituted — the
Decision supporting the Judgment — a body of case-law whose elements
are well known. The Third United Nations Conference, after a decade of
effort, produced the Convention of 10 December 1982 (hereinafter re-
ferred to as the 1982 Convention), which deals with the delimitation of
maritime spaces in a manner which is not that of the above-mentioned
case-law but, even before its adoption by the States members of the
Conference, attracted the support of the Court in the Judgment of 24
February 1982 on the Continental Shelf (Tunisia! Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)
(I.CJ. Reports 1982, pp. 18-94, hereinafter referred to as the 1982 Judg-
ment). References will be made to other decisions but the essential texts
are, on the one hand, the Conventions of 1958 and 1982 and, on the other,
the decisions of 1969, 1977 and 1982. It is a fact that the 1982 Judgment,
which was based on the draft of the 1982 Convention, constituted a sudden
change in the case-law, and that the Convention substituted a new régime
for the delimitation of both the continental shelf and the 200-mile zone for
that which, in the case of the continental shelf, had emerged from the 1958
Convention, the 1969 Judgment and the 1977 Decision. Moreover, it is a
fact that the present Judgment essentially chimes with the standpoint
taken by the Court in 1982. The effects of this marked change of stance in
conventional law and jurisprudence form the main reason for my dis-
agreement with the majority of the Chamber regarding the solution to the

problems raised by the present case. I said at the time why I considered that
the 1982 Judgment had taken a wrong turning (7.C.J. Reports 1982, dis-
senting opinion, pp. 143-156) ; the Court’s deviation could have been
mitigated by a decision of the present Chamber in a dispute which had all
the elements needed to strengthen rather than erode the law on the
delimitation of maritime expanses, but this opportunity has been
missed.

4. 1 would like to make one initial comment on this case which has been
presented by the Parties as an important precedent in international law.
This 1s not so, since the Parties themselves have informed the Chamber of
the precautions they have taken to ensure that, if necessary, they will be
free to negotiate on the boundary laid down by the decision (reply by the
United States to a judge’s question : sitting of 9 May 1984) ; moreover, the
Parties had made sure in advance that the future Judgment would relate
solely to the Gulf of Maine dispute, held to be a case apart from three other
maritime boundary disputes between the two States, as transpires from the
minutes of bilateral talks issued by the State Department in 1975-1976 and
communicated to the Chamber on 8 May 1984 (Ann. 3, September 1976,
pp. 3-6). Finally, the part played in the oral arguments by the concept of
special circumstances, together with the use made of the principles or
methods relied on, would in themselves have been sufficient to ensure that
the effects of the Gulf of Maine Judgment were confined to the actual object
of the dispute, namely the delimitation of the maritime zones of that
particular area.

5. In the Special Agreement the question is put quite simply : What is
the course of the single maritime boundary that divides the continental
shelf and fisheries zones of Canada and the United States of America in the
Gulf of Maine area (preamble and Art. II, para. 1) ? It became apparent
during the argument that this simplicity in fact overlay some serious
problems, which I shail now consider.

I shall begin with the problem of the single boundary line, which the
President of the Chamber raised in his question to the Parties in the
following terms :

“In the event that one particular method, or set of methods, should
appear appropriate for the delimitation of the continental shelf, and
another for that of the exclusive fishery zones, what do the Parties
consider to be the legal grounds that might be invoked for preferring
one or the other in seeking to determine a single line ?” (Sitting of 19
April 1984.)

The wording of this question shows that a point of law that was essential
to the case had not at that time been resolved by the Parties, namely the
question of the law applicable to the determination of a single boundary
dividing a continental shelf and fishery zones, the fundamental question in

problem back to the Chamber itself. At the sitting of 10 April 1984 the
Agent of Canada treated the single boundary as a “legal concept”, and the
Parties appeared to think that the mere fact of their having asked for a
single boundary in the Special Agreement sufficed to impose it on the
Chamber. However, an agreement between parties to request only one line
for the two areas in question does not, in itself, create a rule of law in the
case to be decided, making it possible to ignore all the facts of the case, the
legal elements and all the circumstances relevant to the situation in hand ;
the Parties are agreed on point A, as being the point of departure of the
line, and on the location of its other terminus within a broad triangle — two
indications which, taken together, set a strict limit to the jurisdiction of the
Chamber in determining the course of the boundary — but this does not
turn either point A or the triangle into a legal concept. These elements of
the Special Agreement are minor factual details provided by parties who,
in 15 years of negotiations, had not been able to reach agreement on even
one segment of continental shelf boundary or fishing limit. The Parties did
not invoke any legal considerations when indicating their agreement on
point A, the triangle and the single-line formula : quite the reverse. It was
precisely such legalities that the President’s question called upon them to
explain. The Chamber’s jurisdiction to decide, in law, what the requested
maritime boundary should be was not limited by the Parties’ indications.
Its task was to see whether there existed in international law any rule
prescribing or authorizing the use of a single line for the continental shelf
and the fishery zone, whatever the factual circumstances and the rules of
the applicable law, something that has not been done either by the Parties
or by the Judgment.

6. The Judgment’s reply is given in paragraphs 192-194 : the delimita-
tion called for is “a delimitation of two distinct elements by means of a
single line. This is an unprecedented aspect of the case which lends it its
special character” — and the paragraphs referred to go on to draw con-
clusions for the criteria to be used to unite continental shelf and fisheries

circumstance which takes precedence over all the rest — principles, criteria
and methods — and supersedes the problem of determining whether this
single line is, or is not, established in accordance with law. It is clear to me
that this reply is no reply : the words “special circumstances” are, indeed,
avoided, but the idea is there for sure and, once again, a change of ter-
minology does not suffice to avoid a problem. The “special aspect” of the
single line is a fact, says the Judgment, and as a fact is only relevant if it has
a justifiable influence upon the legal grounds for the boundary to be
determined, the question remains. In the law of delimitation, heretofore,
relevant facts used to be tangible, because they consisted solely of parti-
cular geographic circumstances. When the notion of “special aspect” is


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 364

extended to the fact that a single line has been requested, the question is
put in another guise, but it remains the same : what are the legal grounds
permitting this request to be applied to the facts of the case, namely a
certain continental shelf and certain fishery zones ? — since, if there is no
other answer than to transform a request of the Parties into a special
circumstance from which legal deductions can be made, the applicable law
is confined to an a priori assessment by the Parties. What is more, even the
Parties themselves did not give an answer in this sense to the question put
to them, and they had admitted that here was a real problem which the
Chamber would have to solve. No answer, in fact, has yet been given to the
preliminary question of law as to whether the Chamber may view the words
“single maritime boundary” used in the Special Agreement as a circum-
stance of decisive effect on the delimitation in the Gulf of Maine area or
whether, by virtue of any rules of law applicable to the facts, this request,
which is one fact among others in the overall case, does not in itself suffice
to determine that there shall be a single-line delimitation — this being a
mere hypothesis for so long as it has not been verified on legal grounds. The
International Court of Justice has said :

“the seisin of the Court is one thing, the administration of justice is
another. The latter is governed by the Statute, and by the Rules.”
(Nottebohm, Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1953,
p- 122.)

codified in a convention, while the claims of the coastal State to a fishery
zone in modest areas of the high seas were taken into consideration in a
convention of more limited scope which was rapidly overtaken by the
pretensions of certain coastal States. It was not for another 20 or so years
later, though before the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of

stamp not of legal research but of compromises between interests. Judging
by the accounts given in international law reviews by some of the parti-
cipants, the method of work adopted by the Conference, doing away with
the meetings of committees of jurists but convening groups so composed as
to reflect the opposing interests, gave its proceedings (for which there are

cation conferences. Moreover, the 1982 Convention has not yet come into


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 365

force and, in addition, the Government of the United States, when replying
to a question put by a judge, adopted a particular position with regard to
the Convention which casts doubt upon its applicability to the present case
(sitting of 9 May 1984). It remains to be ascertained whether the text of the
Convention of December 1982 contains any rules of general international
law which as such were already applicable to the delimitation of the
boundary which the Chamber was asked to determine.

8. There is nothing on delimitation of continental shelf or fishery
boundaries in conventional law, in customary law, or more particularly in

coastal State ; first it was the contiguous zone, then the adjacent fishing
zone, at the same time as the continental shelf, then the exclusive economic
or fishery zone which, in certain declarations by States, has connoted an
intention to widen the territorial sea. Whereas the 1958 Convention on the
Continental Shelf contained a rule, the equidistance/special-circum-
stances rule, that rule — though upheld by the case-law from 1969 to
February 1982 — has been eroded by the fact that the Third United
Nations Conference was unable to reach a decision regarding the role of
equidistance and equity other than in texts which do not contain any rule
of delimitation, either for the continental shelf or for the economic zone :
Articles 74 and 83 confine themselves to saying that an agreement based on
international law within the meaning of Article 38 of the Statute of the
Court should make it possible to arrive at an equitable solution. It is dif-
ficult to discern any rule in such a formula : to say that due application of
international law should give rise to an equitable result is a truism. Neces-
sity for an agreement between the States concerned, application of inter-
national law, equity — yes, but by what means ? It was the chairman of the
negotiating group in which the Article 83 compromise formula on delimi-
tation was reached who expressed doubt that “the Conference will ever be
able to draw up a formula providing a clear and precise answer to the ques-
tion of the criteria for delimitation”, as President Sir Humphrey Waldock
has recalled (The International Court and the Law of the Sea, 1979, p. 12 ;
see also Judge Oda’s opinion on the legal value of the 1982 Convention,
LC.J. Reports 1982, p. 246, para. 143). All the gains represented by the legal
edifice of 1958, the 1969 Judgment and the 1977 Decision, have thus been
destroyed by the effect of those two articles of the 1982 Convention,
which take no account of that jurisprudence and efface it by the use of an
empty formula. The Court had already, in February 1982, revised the 1969
Judgment so far as delimitation of the continental shelf was concerned,
by interpreting customary law in accordance with the known provisions of
the draft convention produced by the Third United Nations Conference.

9. The Parties in the present case were acquainted with the 1982 Con-
vention and the change of course in the case-law ; they were unable to
invoke any legal rule but could well have thought that a single line would be


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 366

a convenient formula and serve their interests at present. The position of
the Chamber cannot be the same, so long as it has not been established that
a single line is either prescribed by general international law or legally
demanded by the relevant factors in the present case. The Court in its
Judgment of 24 February 1982 decided to set aside any consideration of
equidistance, because the Parties had not proposed it, but did not maintain
that this would have prevented it from considering that method if it had
thought fit. The Chamber was in no different situation when the time came
to determine whether a delimitation by a single line was legally acceptable
in the circumstances of the present case.

10. Prior to the 1982 Convention, delimitation under the 1958 Conven-

provide the basis for any boundary delimiting the various areas of mari-
time jurisdiction — then of modest extent. A new question arose with the
introduction of the exclusive fishing or economic zone : where lie the
natural identity between the continental shelf and the zone and the rela-
tionship of dependence between a State and waters stretching for 200
miles ? In 1973, Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice observed in this connection
that “there must come a point at which claims to territorial waters would
verge on the absurd” as soon as those waters ceased to retain any sort of
physical bond with the lands “to which they were supposed to be ...
appurtenant” (I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 72, para. 8). It is these pretensions,

previous codifications before the Third United Nations Conference on the
Law of the Sea, which now come to the fore : the ambition is to wrest from
the sea the greatest possible expanse with a view to its immediate or
eventual exploitation and, above all, the exclusion of others. It is the
seizure of vast areas, the continental shelf and the 200-mile zone, which has
become the aim, with repercussions on a law of delimitation which the
1958 and 1960 Conferences had dealt with at a time when the boundary
problem applied to a territorial sea of 3 or 6 miles, or a fishing zone of up to 12
miles, with the ensuring of opposability to third States as the main concern.

way to arbitrariness by defining nothing, and it is likewise the reasoning of
the Chamber's Judgment, founded as it is, like the 1982 Judgment, on those
same articles and, like the articles themselves, on an a priori denial of the
equidistance method and on the concurrent use of various criteria, meth-
ods and arguments solely interconnected by the idea of arriving at an
equitable result. The Chamber thus followed the Parties in adopting,


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 367

through the propounding of a “fundamental norm”, the unusable formula
of the 1982 Convention (paras. 7 and 8 above) and decided to apply it to the
case. The terms in which the Chamber has formulated this rule in para-
graph 112 of the Judgment are merely the veil for two words that sum it up
just as well as two subparagraphs : agreement + equity.

11. The 1982 Convention replaced the continental shelf concept as
codified by the 1958 Convention with the one notion of a distance of 200
miles, whether or not the coastal State has that natural prolongation of its
land territory which the 1969 Judgment analysed (paras. 47-48 and 95 ;
1977 Decision, paras. 191 and 194 ; cf. 1982 Convention, Art. 76, para. 1).
Hence certain States now are credited with a mythical, non-existent con-
tinental shelf, whereas others which do have such a natural physical pro-
longation see no account taken of it — that is, if one holds that the 1982
Convention which is not yet in force has indeed, on this point, modified the
1958 Convention, which the Judgment does not say. Not having to judge
anything other than the subject of the present dispute, I would say that the
question does not arise between the Parties, who are bound by the 1958
Convention on the Continental Shelf. The United States has not main-
tained that the 1958 Convention has lapsed, but that it is not “determi-
native” for the delimitation of a single line ; the Anglo-French Court of
Arbitration had formally rejected the contention, put forward at that time
by the French Government, that the 1958 Convention had lapsed. The
Parties agree that the continental shelf of the Gulf of Maine area is one
continuous, unbroken shelf. The present case therefore features both a
recognized physical continental shelf and a continental shelf convention
which is in force but is not being applied between the Parties.

12. As to the 200-mile fishery zone claimed by either Party, it must be
pointed out that the arguments before the Chamber were often widened to
cover the concept of an economic zone. This was not what was called for in
the Special Agreement, which speaks only of fishery zones, and the United
States decision to claim an exclusive economic zone, taken in 1983 while
the case was pending, cannot have any effect on the boundary decision.
Admittedly, Article III, paragraph 1, of the Special Agreement does pro-
vide that the maritime boundary decided by the Chamber shall apply to
any claim or exercise of sovereign rights or jurisdiction over the waters or
sea-bed and subsoil. But the Chamber is judging what has been submitted
to it, i.e., a continental shelf and fisheries boundary (Special Agreement,
Art. II, para. 1). The fishery zones of the two States connote exploitation of
the fishing resources of the volume of water within the 200-mile limit.
Whereas the continental shelf presents a problem of sea-bed and subsoil
resources (1969 Judgment, para. 96 in fine), the delimitation of fisheries
involves division of the water column. A single boundary will establish a
unity between the sea-bed and the exploitation of the subsoil on the one
hand, and the water column with its resources on the other ; it cannot be
assumed that this unity is pre-existent. The two elements have always been
treated separately. In 1958 there was one convention on the continental
shelf and another on fishing, while back in 1945 the United States made

“In reality, a delimitation by a single line, such as that which has to
be carried out in the present case, i.e., a delimitation which has to
apply at one and the same time to the continental shelf and to the
superjacent water column, can only be carried out by the application
of a criterion, or combination of criteria, which does not give prefer-
ential treatment to one of these two objects to the detriment of the other,
and at the same time is such as to be equally suitable to the division of
either of them. In that regard, moreover, it can be foreseen that with
the gradual adoption by the majority of maritime States of an ex-
clusive economic zone and, consequently, an increasingly general

14. It seems to me difficult to consider that the Chamber has thus
replied to the question which its President had put to the Parties. One
cannot simultaneously recognize the existence of two different realities
and decide to ignore the difference in determining the boundary except on
the supposition that words can be used to suppress a problem rather than
deal with it. Even had it been possible, in the case of an unreal continental
shelf area, but only given present possibilities of exploitation, to maintain
that this false continental shelf was not to be distinguished from the water
column, it is out of the question to do so after having recognized the
existence in the Gulf of Maine of a real, continuous continental shelf,
which has already been explored. In the second place, after having dis-
carded the continental shelf, to strike an equal balance according to the


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 369

logic of the Judgment, one must also exclude the fisheries ; it is a sea
deprived of all meaning, an empty sea, which is to be divided — which was
not among the Parties’ themes. Finally, I find it hard to grasp what a
criterion can be that does not give preferential treatment to one object to the
detriment of the other and at the same time is suitable to both ; these words
call for explanations which are not provided by the Judgment and cannot
be for others to provide. If they are to be taken in their proper sense, the
criterion must do no harm either to one object (continental shelf) or to the
other (water), so it must be a criterion devoid of effect : one which, to avoid
giving preferential treatment, exerts no action. But, in that case, how is it
suitable ? The only conclusion to be drawn is that the President’s question
remains unresolved, not only in regard to the dispute here decided but for
any States contemplating a single boundary. It still remains to be explained
how two States bound by Article 6 of the 1958 Convention on the Con-
tinental Shelf become released from it because it does not apply to a
superjacent zone of water ; before any question of a single boundary arose,
the continental shelf was already covered by the high seas, which were
subject to a different régime. The result of refusing to balance up the
equities of the two elements, the continental shelf and the water column, is
that the water has obliterated all consideration of the other element with-
out any opportunity being allowed of appreciating how the latter would
have prejudiced the former. To say that the two elements are a priori in
opposition is not found sufficient, and the maxim becomes : only the water
counts. This is surprising, because no equitable criterion is revealed for
dividing the water without first ensuring that no harm is done to the
continental shelf, which means that the latter element will always be the
loser. The obligation to apply the 1958 Convention in force between the
Parties as regards the “object” continental shelf cannot be escaped on the
pretext that it would be detrimental to the “object” water or not “be
suitable” ; in the present case it is necessary to begin with the treaty
applicable in regard to the continental shelf and to see which element is
favoured or disfavoured.

15. By not carrying out an examination of the proper factors for deter-
mining the course of a boundary equitable for both elements, the conti-
nental shelf and the fisheries, the Chamber has failed to assess the equities
in its treatment of the facts. Perhaps there is still time to challenge the
unwarranted confusion of the elements to be delimited and to prevent the
idea from taking root that, in contemporary positive law, only one delimi-
tation rule still exists : up to 200 miles from each State, its jurisdiction over
the waters of the sea and everything which they contain or cover is total,
and one need only divide up the water between the States concerned for the
rest to follow of its own accord. For such a ruling to be a rule, some better
grounds must be found for it than what exists at present, which is confined
to a bare assertion in the absence of such an examination as a court must
normally carry out in order to apply the law to the facts. What weight do
use of the subsoil and use of the water carry in the determination of the
boundary : the same weight, different weights or no weight at all ? Even if


GULF OF MAINE (DISS. OP. GROS) 370

it were none at all, as the Chamber holds — subject to the small role
conceded in extremis to checking that the line does not harm the balance of
interests (paras. 238-239) —, it would be useful to know the reason for this
total negation.

16. A single boundary not justified by legal reasoning can be neither the
“reasonable” solution called for by the 1969 Judgment, paragraph 90
in fine, nor the equitable result in terms of the fundamental norm pro-
pounded by the Parties and taken up by the Chamber (Judgment, para.
112). The existence of some bilateral agreements that have fixed a single
