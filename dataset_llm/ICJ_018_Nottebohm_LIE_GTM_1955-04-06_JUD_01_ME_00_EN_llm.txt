But the issue which the Court must decide is not one which
pertains to the legal system of Liechtenstein. It does not depend
on the law or on the decision of Liechtenstein whether that State
is entitled to exercise its protection, in the case under considera-
tion. To exercise protection, to apply to the Court, is to place one-



self on the plane of international law. It is international law which
determines whether a State is entitled to exercise protection and
to seise the Court.

The naturalization of Nottebohm was an act performed by
Liechtenstein in the exercise of its domestic jurisdiction. The
question to be decided is whether that act has the international
effect here under consideration.

International practice provides many examples of acts per-
formed by States in the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction
which do not necessarily or automatically have international effect,
which are not necessarily and automatically binding on other
States or which are binding on them only subject to certain condi-
tions : this is the case, for instance, of a judgment given by the
competent court of a State which it is sought to invoke in another
State.

In the present case it is necessary to determine whether the
naturalization conferred on Nottebohm can be successfully invoked
against Guatemala, whether, as has already been stated, it can
be relied upon as against that State, so that Liechtenstein is
thereby entitled to exercise its protection in favour of Nottebohm
against Guatemala.

When one State has conferred its nationality upon an individual
and another State has conferred its own nationality on the same
person, it may occur that each of these States, considering itself to
have acted in the exercise of its domestic jurisdiction, adheres to its
own. view and bases itself thereon in so far as its own actions are
concerned. In so doing, each State remains within the limits of its
domestic jurisdiction.

This situation may arise on the international plane and fall to be
considered by international arbitrators or by the courts of a third
State. If the arbitrators or the courts of such a State should confine
themselves to the view that nationality is exclusively within the
domestic jurisdiction of the State, it would be necessary for them
to find that they were confronted by two contradictory assertions
made by two sovereign States, assertions which they would conse-
quently have to regard as of equal weight, which would oblige them
to allow the contradiction to subsist and thus fail to resolve the
conflict submitted to them.

In most cases arbitrators have not strictly speaking had to
decide a conflict of nationality as between States, but rather to
determine whether the nationality invoked by the applicant
State was one which could be relied upon as against the respon-
dent State, that is to say, whether it entitled the applicant State
to exercise protection. International arbitrators, having before
them allegations of nationality by the applicant State which.
were contested by the respondent State, have sought to ascertain
whether nationality had been conferred by the applicant State in
circumstances such as to give rise to an obligation on the part



of the respondent State to recognize the effect of that nationality.
In order to decide this question arbitrators have evolved certain
principles for determining whether full international effect was
to be attributed to the nationality invoked. The same issue is
now before the Court: it must be resolved by applying the
same principles.

The courts of third States, when confronted by a similar situation,
have dealt with it in the same way. They have done so not in
connection with the exercise of protection, which did not arise
before them, but where two different nationalities have been
invoked before them they have had, not indeed to decide such
a dispute as between the two States concerned, but to determine
whether a given foreign nationality which had been invoked
before them was one which they ought to recognize.

International arbitrators have decided in the same way numerous
casés of dual nationality, where the question arose with regard to
the exercise of protection. They have given their preference to the
real and effective nationality, that which accorded with the facts,
that based on stronger factual ties between the person concerned
and one of the States whose nationality is involved. Different
factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will
vary from one case to the next: the habitual residence of the
individual concerned is an important factor, but there are other
factors such as the centre of his interests, his family ties, his
participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given
country and inculcated in his children, etc.

Similarly, the courts of third States, when they have before them
an individual whom two other States hold to be their national, seek
to resolve the conflict by having recourse to international criteria
and their prevailing tendency is to prefer the real and effective
nationality.

The same tendency prevails in the writings of publicists and in
practice. This notion is inherent in the provisions of Article 3,
paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court. National laws reflect this
tendency when, infer alia, they make naturalization dependent
on conditions indicating the existence of a link, which may vary in
their purpose or in their nature but which are essentially concerned
with this idea. The Liechtenstein Law of January 4th, 1934, is a
good example.

The practice of certain States which refrain from exercising
protection in favour of a naturalized person when the latter has
in fact, by his prolonged absence, severed his links with what is
no longer for him anything but his nominal country, manifests
the view of these States that, in order to be capable of being
invoked against another State, nationality must correspond with
the factual situation. A similar view is manifested in the relevant
provisions of the bilateral nationality treaties concluded between
the United States of America and other States since 1868, such as



those sometimes referred to as the Bancroft Treaties, and in the
Pan-American Convention, signed at Rio de Janeiro on August 13th,
1906, on the status of naturalized citizens who resume residence
in their country of origin.

The character thus recognized on the international level as per-
taining to nationality is in no way inconsistent with the fact that
international law leaves it to each State to lay down the rules
governing the grant of its own nationality. The reason for this is
that the diversity of demographic conditions has thus far made
it impossible for any general agreement to be reached on the
rules relating to nationality, although the latter by its very nature
affects international relations. It has been considered that the best
way of making such rules accord with the varying demographic
conditions in different countries is to leave the fixing of such
rules to the competence of each State. On the other hand, a State
cannot claim that the rules it has thus laid down are entitled to
recognition by another State unless it has acted in conformity
with this general aim of making the legal bond of nationality
accord with the individual's genuine connection with the State
which assumes the defence of its citizens by means of protection
as against other States.

The requirement that such a concordance must exist is to be
found in the studies carried on in the course of the last thirty
years upon the initiative and under the auspices of the League of
Nations and the United Nations. It explains the provision which
the Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at
The Hague in 1930, inserted in Article 1 of the Convention relating
to the Conflict of Nationality Laws, laying down that the law
enacted by a State for the purpose of determining who are its
nationals “shall be recognized by other States in so far as it is
consistent with .... international custom, and the principles of law
generally recognized with regard to nationality”. In the same spirit,
Article 5 of the Convention refers to criteria of the individual's
genuine connections for the purpose of resolving questions of dual
nationality which arise in third States.

According to the practice of States, to arbitral and judicial
decisions and to the opinions of writers, nationality is a legal
bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine
connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the
existence of reciprocal rights and duties. It may be said to consti-
tute the juridical expression of the fact that the individual upon
whom it is conferred, either directly by the law or as the result of
an act of the authorities, is in fact more closely connected with the
population of the State conferring nationality than with that of
any other State. Conferred by a State, it only entitles that State
to exercise protection vis-a-vis another State, if it constitutes a
translation into juridical terms of the individual’s connection with
the State which has made him its national.



Diplomatic protection and protection by means of international
judicial proceedings constitute measures for the defence of the
rights of the State. As the Permanent Court of. International
Justice has said and has repeated, “by taking up the case of one
of its subjects and by resorting to diplomatic action or inter-
national judicial proceedings on his behalf, a State is in reality
asserting its own rights—its right to ensure, in the person of its
subjects, respect for the rules of international law” (P.C.I.J., Series
A, No. 2, p. 12, and Series A/B, Nos. 20-21, p. 17).

Since this is the character which nationality must present when
it is invoked to furnish the State which has granted it with a
title to the exercise of protection and to the institution of inter-
national judicial proceedings, the Court must ascertain whether
the nationality granted to Nottebohm by means of naturalization
is of this character or, in other words, whether the factual con-
nection between Nottebohm and Liechtenstein in the period
preceding, contemporaneous with and following his naturalization
appears to be sufficiently close, so preponderant in relation to
any connection which may have existed between him and any
other State, that it is possible to regard the nationality conferred
upon him as real and effective, as the exact juridical expression of a
social fact of a connection which existed previously or came into
existence thereafter.

Naturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to
obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a
human being. It involves his breaking of a bond of allegiance and
his establishment of a new bond of allegiance. It may have far-
reaching consequences and involve profound changes in the destiny
of the individual who obtains it. It concerns him personally, and to
consider it only from the point of view of its repercussions with
regard to his property would be to misunderstand its profound
significance. In order to appraise its international effect, it is impos-
sible to disregard the circumstances in which it was conferred, the
serious character which attaches to it, the real and effective,
and not merely the verbal preference of the individual seeking it
for the country which grants it to him.

At the time of his naturalization does Nottebohm appear to have
been more closely attached by his tradition, his establishment, his
interests, his activities, his family ties, his intentions for the near
future to Liechtenstein than to any other State ?

The essential facts appear with sufficient clarity from the record.
The Court considers it unnecessary to have regard to the docu-
ments purporting to show that Nottebohm had or had not
retained his interests in Germany, or to have regard to the alter-
native submission of Guatemala relating to a request to Liechten-



stein to produce further documents. It would further point out that
the Government of Liechtenstein, in asking in its Final Conclusions
for an adjournment of the oral proceedings and an opportunity to
present further documents, did so only for the eventuality of the
Application being held to be admissible and not for the purpose of
throwing further light upon the question of the admissibility of the
Application.

The essential facts are as follows :

At the date when he applied for naturalization Nottebohm had
been a German national from the time of his birth. He had always
retained his connections with members of his family who had
remained in Germany and he had always had business connections
with that country. His country had been at war for more than a
month, and there is nothing to indicate that the application for
naturalization then made by Nottebohm was motivated by any
desire to dissociate himself from the Government of his country.

He had been settled in Guatemala for 34 years. He had carried on
his activities there. It was the main seat of his interests. He returned
there shortly after his naturalization, and it remained the centre of
his interests and of his business activities. He stayed there until
his removal as a result of war measures in 1943. He subsequently
attempted to return there, and he now complains of Guatemala’s
refusal to admit him. There, too, were several members of his
family who sought to safeguard his interests.

In contrast, his actual connections with Liechtenstein were
extremely tenuous. No settled abode, no prolonged residence in
that country at the time of his application for naturalization : the
application indicates that he was paying a visit there and confirms
the transient character of this visit by its request that the naturali-
zation proceedings should be initiated and concluded without delay.
No intention of settling there was shown at that time or realized
in the ensuing weeks, months or years—on the contrary, he re-
turned to Guatemala very shortly after his naturalization and
showed every intention of remaining there. If Nottebohm went
to Liechtenstein in 1946, this was because of the refusal of Guate-
mala to admit him. No indication is given of the grounds warrant-
ing the waiver of the condition of residence, required by the
1934 Nationality Law, which waiver was implicitly granted to him.
There is no allegation of any economic interests or of any activities
exercised or to be exercised in Liechtenstein, and no manifestation
of any intention whatsoever to transfer all or some of his interests
and his business activities to Liechtenstein. It is unnecessary
in this connection to attribute much importance to the promise to
pay the taxes levied at the time of his naturalization. The only
links to be discovered between the Principality and Nottebohm
are the short sojourns already referred to and the presence in
Vaduz of one of his brothers : but his brother’s presence is referred



to in his application for naturalization only as a reference to his
good conduct. Furthermore, other members of his family have
asserted Nottebohm’s desire to spend his old age in Guatemala.

These facts clearly establish, on the one hand, the absence of
any bond of attachment between Nottebohm and Liechtenstein
and, on the other hand, the existence of a long-standing and close
connection between him and Guatemala, a link which his naturali-
zation in no way weakened. That naturalization was not based on
any real prior connection with Liechtenstein, nor did it in any
way alter the manner of life of the person upon whom it was
conferred in exceptional circumstances of speed and accommoda-
tion. In both respects, it was lacking in the genuineness requisite
to an act of such importance, if it is to be entitled to be respected
by a State in the position of Guatemala. It was granted without
regard to the concept of nationality adopted in international
relations.

Naturalization was asked for not so much for the purpose of
obtaining a legal recognition of Nottebohm’s membership in fact
in the population. of Liechtenstein, as it was to enable him to
substitute for his status as a national of a belligerent State that of
a national of a neutral State, with the sole aim of thus coming
within the protection of Liechtenstein but not of becoming wedded
to its traditions, its interests, its way of life or of assuming the
obligations—other than fiscal obligations—and exercising the rights
pertaining to the status thus acquired.

Guatemala is under no obligation to recognize a nationality
granted in such circumstances. Liechtenstein consequently is not
entitled to extend its protection to Nottebohm vis-à-vis Guatemala
and. its claim must, for this reason, be held to be inadmissible.

The Court is not therefore called upon to deal with the other
pleas in bar put forward by Guatemala or the Conclusions of the

- Parties other than those on which it is adjudicating in accordance
with the reasons indicated above.

For these reasons,
THE COURT,
by eleven votes to three,

Holds that the claim submitted by the Government of the
Principality of Liechtenstein is inadmissible.
