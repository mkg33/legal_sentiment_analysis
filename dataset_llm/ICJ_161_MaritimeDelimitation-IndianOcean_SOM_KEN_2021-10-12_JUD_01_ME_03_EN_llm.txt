                         1. I am in agreement with the decision of the Court to reject Kenya’s
                      claim that Somalia had acquiesced to a maritime boundary that follows
                      the parallel of latitude described in paragraph 35 of the Judgment.
                         2. I also concur in the decision of the Court to deny Kenya’s request to
                      adjudge and declare that the maritime boundary between Somalia and
                      Kenya in the Indian Ocean shall follow the parallel of latitude at
                      1° 39ʹ 43.2ʺ S. As noted in paragraph 130 of the Judgment, “the Court does
                      not consider that the use of the parallel of latitude is the appropriate meth-
                      odology to achieve an equitable solution”.
                         3. Consequently, the Court has decided to apply a median line in the
                      territorial sea as prescribed by Article 15 of the United Nations Conven-
                      tion on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter “UNCLOS”) and to use its usual
                      three-stage methodology for the establishment of the maritime boundary
                      in the exclusive economic zone (hereinafter “EEZ”) and continental shelf.
                      However, the way in which the base points have been selected in the con-
                      struction of the median line for the territorial sea departs from the provi-
                      sions of UNCLOS and from the jurisprudence of the Court. I will
                      therefore address this matter in the present opinion.
                         4. As indicated in my vote against subparagraphs (4) and (5) of the dis‑
                      positif, my main disagreement relates to the manner in which the three-
                      stage methodology has been implemented, particularly with regard to the
                      adjustment of the equidistance line. I could not agree with the unprece-
                      dented search for a concavity in a so-­called “broader geographical configu-
                      ration” (cf. paragraphs 164-168 of the Judgment), which has nothing to do

                           II. The Construction of a Median Line in the Territorial Sea

                         8. The approach taken in the Judgment in the selection of base points
                      for the construction of a median line is questionable for a number of rea-
                      sons. First, according to Article 15 of UNCLOS, the median line in the
                      territorial sea shall be constructed by reference to “the nearest points on
                      the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the
                      two States is measured” 1. In this regard, Article 5 of UNCLOS states
                      that, in principle, “the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the
                      territorial sea is the low‑water line along the coast” (emphasis added). In
                      Qatar v. Bahrain, the Court referred to Article 5 of UNCLOS and stated
                      that “under the applicable rules of international law the normal

                      b
                      coast” 2.

                         9. Similarly, in Eritrea/Yemen, the arbitral tribunal rejected Yemen’s
                      argument that it should establish the median line boundary from base
                      points on the high-water line, noting that “the use of the low‑water line is
                      laid down by a general international rule in the Convention’s article 5”
                      and this “accords with long practice and with the well-­established cus-
                      tomary rule of the law of the sea” 3. In Bangladesh v. India, the UNCLOS
                      Annex VII arbitral tribunal referred to Eritrea/Yemen and reaffirmed that
                      it would “determine the appropriate base points by reference to the phys-
                      ical geography at the time of the delimitation and to the low-water line of
                      the relevant coasts 4”.

                         10. Thus, both this Court and other international courts and tribunals
                      have plotted a provisional equidistance or median line in the territorial
                      sea by reference to such base points on the low‑water line in accordance
                      with Article 5 of UNCLOS and general international law 5. It follows
                      that, in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS, its own jurispru-
                      dence and the practice of other courts and tribunals, the Court should
                      have constructed a provisional median line by reference to such base
                      points on the low-water line from which the breadth of the territorial sea
                      is measured. However, the Judgment deviates from this practice without
                      providing adequate reasons for its seemingly random selection of base
                      points.

                         11. Secondly, it is well established that, when the parties agree on a
                      particular point, such as the placement of base points on the coast for the
                      purposes of maritime delimitation, the respective court or tribunal will
                      respect that agreement 6, unless particular reasons warrant a different con-
                      clusion. In the present case, both Parties have proposed base points for
                      the construction of the provisional median line, which reflect the geo-
                      graphical reality in the immediate vicinity of the land boundary terminus
                      (hereinafter “LBT”). In its Memorial, Somalia identified three base points
                      on the Somali side, two of which were located on the Diua Damasciaca
                      Islands (S1 and S2), while the third (S3) was located on a low-tide eleva-
                      tion near the southernmost tip of Ras Kaambooni 7. On the Kenyan side,
                      Somalia identified two base points (K1 and K2) “on the most seaward
                      points on the charted low-tide coast” of Kenya’s mainland 8.

                         12. While Kenya did not originally identify any base points for the
                      construction of the provisional median line, it provided such co-­ordinates
                      in the additional document it submitted as Appendix 2, Volume 1 (here-
                      inafter “KAD”) 9. First, Kenya proposed two base points on the main-
                      land in the immediate vicinity of the LBT (K1 and S1), both of which are
                      less than 1 km away from the LBT. On the Somali side, Kenya proposed
                      a base point (S2) on the Diua Damasciaca Islands, and another base
                      point (S3) on the low-water line of Ras Kaambooni. On the Kenyan side,
                      Kenya has — just like Somalia — proposed base points on the low-water
                      line of the mainland’s coastline (K3, K4 and K5) 10.

                      297 	              maritime delimitation (sep. op. yusuf)

                         13. The base points proposed by the Parties for the construction of the
                      provisional median line are largely concordant. Both Somalia and Kenya
                      have placed base points on the Diua Damasciaca Islands and the low-
                      water line of the mainland. Indeed, Kenya’s S2 is some 74 metres away
                      from Somalia’s S1, and about 342 metres away from Somalia’s S2. The
                      distance between Kenya’s S3 and Somalia’s S3 is approximately
                      587 metres. Somalia’s K2 is just about 775 metres away from Kenya’s
                      K3 and 230 metres away from Kenya’s K4 11. As a result, the provisional
                      median lines constructed by both Parties are very similar, as the Parties
                      themselves have acknowledged 12.

                         14. Notwithstanding the Parties’ general agreement on this point, the
                      Judgment disregards the base points proposed by the Parties both on the
                      mainland low-water line and the southernmost tip of Ras Kaambooni, as
                      well as the Diua Damasciaca Islands, and departs both from the provi-
                      sions of UNCLOS and from the jurisprudence of the Court regarding
                      base points. Instead, a median line is constructed using base points which
                      are located exclusively on the Parties’ terra firma (S1 to S4 and K1 to K4)
                      and spread across an artificially straight line on the coast (paragraphs 115-
                      116 of the Judgment). This is justified in the Judgment with the following
                      statement: “Although in the identification of base points the Court will
                      have regard to the proposals of the parties, it need not select a particular
                      base point, even if the parties are in agreement thereon, if it does not
                      consider that base point to be appropriate” (para. 111).

                         15. It may be true that in the Black Sea case, the Court stated that it
                      “should not base itself solely on the choice of base points made by one of
                      those Parties” 13. The Court, however, did not suggest that it enjoys an
                      unlimited discretion in selecting whichever base points it likes, nor did it
                      elevate the criterion of “appropriateness” or what the Court “consider[s] . . .
                      to be appropriate” (see paragraphs 111-112) to an all-­encompassing stan-
                      dard on the basis of which the identification of base points should be
                      made. On the contrary, the Court stated that it “must . . . select base
                      points by reference to the physical geography of the relevant coasts” 14. In
                      the same vein, the Court stressed that
                           “the geometrical nature of the first stage of the delimitation exercise
                           leads it to use as base points those which the geography of the coast
                           identifies as a physical reality at the time of the delimitation. That

                           by geodynamics and the movements of the sea, but also any other

                         16. Thirdly, it is difficult to understand the decision to ignore the base
                      points proposed by the Parties on the southernmost tip of Ras Kaam-
                      booni, a protuberance on the Somali mainland near the LBT. By ignoring
                      Ras Kaambooni, the Judgment has disregarded a material feature in
                      Somalia’s coastline which marks a “significant shift” in the direction of its
                      coast. Even more confusingly, while paragraph 114 of the Judgment dis-
                      counts Ras Kaambooni as a “minor protuberance” for the purposes of a
                      median line, paragraph 146 of the Judgment places base point S6 on a
                      much smaller protuberance in Somalia’s coast (opposite the Umfaali
                      islets) for the purposes of constructing a provisional equidistance line in
                      the EEZ and continental shelf. No explanation is given in the Judgment
                      for such an inconsistent selection of base points.

                         17. Fourthly, this inconsistent approach is further repeated with regard
                      to the base points proposed by the Parties on the Diua Damasciaca
                      Islands, which are equally set aside. According to the Judgment, these
                      islands are “tiny [and] arid” and “would have a disproportionate impact
                      on the course of the median line” (para. 114). Curiously, however, para-
                      graph 146 of the Judgment has placed base points K5 and K6 on Shakani
                      Island off Kenya’s main coast, without giving reasons for this manifest
                      inconsistency.
                         18. The fact that the Diua Damasciaca Islands are “tiny [and] arid”
                      does not, ipso facto, preclude the Parties or the Court from selecting
                      appropriate base points thereon as reflected in the past practice of the
                      Court. It should indeed be recalled that the Court has considered appro-
                      priate to place base points on small insular features that were located in
                      the immediate vicinity of the coast. This was the case, for example, in the
                      Black Sea case, where the Court considered appropriate to use the south-­
                      eastern tip of Tsyganka Island as a base point, “because in this area of
                      adjacency it [was] the most prominent point on the Ukrainian coast” 16.
                      In Nicaragua v. Colombia, the Court also considered that the “islands
                      fringing the Nicaraguan coast” formed part of the “relevant coast” of
                      Nicaragua, and consequently placed the base points on the Edinburgh
                      Reef, Muerto Cay, Miskitos Cays, Ned Thomas Cay, Roca Tyra, Little
                      Corn Island and Great Corn Island 17. Also, while the Court refrained
                      from placing base points on sandy features that are relatively unstable, it

                      observed in Costa Rica v. Nicaragua that it would “construct the provi-
                      sional median line for delimiting the territorial sea only on the basis of
                      points situated on the natural coast, which may include points placed on
                      islands or rocks” 18.
                         19. The Judgment’s approach in the selection of base points has resulted
                      in a contrived median line, the construction of which appears to have been
                      aimed at producing a line which comes as close as possible to a bisector
                      line, although there is nothing that justifies the use of a bisector for the
                      delimitation of the territorial sea between Somalia and Kenya. Para-
                      graph 118 in the Judgment reinforces this impression. Indeed, this para-
                      graph suggests that the approach adopted by the Court for the construction
                      of the median line may have been dictated by the search for a median line
                      that “corresponds closely to the course of a line ‘at right angles to the
                      general trend of the coastline’, assuming that the 1927/1933 treaty arrange-
                      ment, in using this phrase, had as an objective to draw a line that contin-
                      ues into the territorial sea, a question that the Court need not decide”.
                         20. The 1927/1933 land boundary demarcation arrangements con-
                      cluded between the former colonial Powers (United Kingdom and Italy)
                      have no relevance whatsoever to the dispute between Somalia and Kenya
                      or to the delimitation of their maritime boundaries, because no maritime
                      boundary between them was ever established by such arrangements, nor
                      by the land boundary agreement concluded between the two colonial
                      Powers in 1924, on which the 1927/1933 arrangements are based. As
                      stated by Somalia in its reply to the question posed by a Member of the
                      Court, “[n]either [it] nor Kenya, since their independence and at all times
                      thereafter, has ever claimed that the maritime boundary in the territorial
                      sea follows a line perpendicular to the coast at Dar es Salam, for any
                      distance”.
                         21. The reference to such arrangements in paragraph 118, and the
                      manner in which it is phrased, can only create misunderstandings. That is
                      particularly the case because the Judgment itself, several paragraphs ear-
                      lier, discounts the relevance of such colonial land demarcation agree-
                      ments to the maritime boundary, inter alia, on the basis of the positions
                      taken by the two neighbouring States both in their national legislation
                      and in their negotiations and statements (see paragraphs 106 to 109). It is
                      indeed concluded at the end of these paragraphs that “the Court there-
                      fore considers it unnecessary to decide whether the 1927/1933 treaty
                      arrangement had as an objective the delimitation of the boundary in the
                      territorial sea” (para. 109). Such an objective could not manifestly exist in
                      a land demarcation agreement. What purpose is then served by invoking
                      the same arrangement again in paragraph 118 in connection with the
                      course of the median line as constructed by the Court? None whatsoever,
                      in my view, if not to cast unwarranted doubt on the validity of the posi-

                                            within 200 Nautical Miles

                         22. As pointed out above, I disagree with the flawed reasoning used in
                      the Judgment to justify the adjustment of the provisional equidistance
                      line. It is wrong both as a matter of fact and of law. As a matter of fact,
                      it entails an arbitrary refashioning of the geography by engaging in a
                      search for a purported “concavity” in a so-­called “broader geographical
                      configuration” beyond the area of delimitation, which appears to be
                      aimed at achieving preconceived results. As a matter of law, the reasoning
                      deviates not only from the Court’s long-­standing jurisprudence on the
                      delimitation of the EEZ and continental shelf, but also from that of other
                      international tribunals, without offering any rationalization for doing so.
                      I will address each of these points in turn.

                              A. Refashioning of Geography in Search of a Concavity and
                                                  an Elusive Cut-off
                         23. The Court had hitherto applied its dictum that there should be no
                      question of “a judicial refashioning of geography, which neither the law
                      nor the practice of maritime delimitation authorizes” 19. It is unfortunate
                      that the Judgment breaks with that tradition. It does so by engaging in a
                      search for a concavity beyond the coasts of the Parties and an elusive cut-
                      off effect that could justify the adjustment of the equidistance line. Thus,
                      it is stated in paragraph 164 that “[i]f the examination of the coastline is
                      limited only to the coasts of Kenya and Somalia, any concavity is not
                      conspicuous”. This is quite correct, and the story should have ended there
                      because as was stressed by the Court in Cameroon v. Nigeria, “the conca-
                      vity of the coastline may be a circumstance relevant to delimitation”, but
                      “this can only be the case when such concavity lies within the area to be
                      delimited” 20. However, the Judgment then goes on to say: “examining
                      only the coastlines of the two States concerned to assess the extent of any
                      cut-off effect resulting from the geographical configuration of the coast-
                      line may be an overly narrow approach”. It is not clear why the analysis
                      is suddenly shifted to an assessment of a cut-off effect, or what is exactly
                      meant by “geographical configuration of the coastline” in this context. In

                      301 	            maritime delimitation (sep. op. yusuf)

                      any case, “examining only the coastlines of the two States concerned” is
                      not a narrow approach, but is in conformity with the scope of the juris-
                      diction of the Court which cannot be extended to the coastlines of third
                      States. Somalia and Kenya requested the Court to delimit their maritime
                      boundary, not that of third States. It is also legally erroneous to look for
                      a concavity outside of the area to be delimited or to try to import it into
                      a geographical area where it does not exist in order to achieve pre-
                      conceived results.


                         24. The relevant circumstances that may justify the adjustment of a
                      provisional equidistance line are essentially of a geographical nature.
                      Indeed, the construction or adjustment of an equidistance line is dictated
                      by the particular geography of the area to be delimited. It must faithfully
                      reflect that geography, and that geography only. For such circumstances
                      to be taken into account in order to achieve an equitable solution, they
                      must also arise within the area to be delimited. It is the geographical situ-
                      ation of that area, its coastal configuration, the length of the coast and
                      the presence of any special or unusual maritime features therein that may
                      give rise to relevant circumstances to be taken into account in the con-
                      struction or adjustment of an equidistance line. The importation of extra-
                      neous geographical factors lying beyond the Parties’ relevant coasts and
                      the relevant area plainly contradicts the cardinal principle that “the land
                      dominates the sea”.
                         25. The reliance of the Judgment on a so-­called “broader geographical
                      configuration”, which is not defined anywhere and the scope of which is
                      not clearly indicated, effectively disconnects its analysis from the reality
                      of the geographical circumstances prevailing in the relevant coasts and
                      the relevant area of the maritime dispute between Somalia and Kenya.
                      Moreover, by expanding the scope of enquiry into the coastline of a third
                      State, the Judgment has reduced into irrelevance the role and function of
                      the central concepts of “relevant coasts” and “relevant area” in the
                      three‑stage methodology developed over the years by the Court for mari-
                      time delimitation, while paying lip service to their use in the present case.
                         26. Both the meaning of the word “concave” and the concept of “con-
                      cavity” in maritime delimitation are also misused in the Judgment. First,
                      in order to be described as “concave”, a coastline must look indented,
                      hollowed or recessed in the middle, and curve inward like the inside of a
                      bowl. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, concave means “hav-
                      ing an outline or surface that curves inward like the interior of a circle or
                      sphere”. Is there any coastal area which curves inward or looks like the
                      inside of a bowl or the interior of a circle in the coastline of Somalia or
                      Kenya? The answer is negative. The Judgment itself recognizes as much
                      in paragraph 164. However, in an attempt at judicial refashioning of
                      geography, it continues in its relentless, yet unjustified, search of such
                      “concavity” in what it refers to as a “broader geographical configura-
                      tion”.

                         27. Secondly, a concavity is a geographical given. It either exists or not
                      in the area to be delimited. For it to be acknowledged or taken into
                      account in the context of a maritime delimitation, it must belong to the
                      geographical reality of such an area. It cannot be grafted onto the area by
                      importing it from a “broader geographical configuration”, whatever such
                      an expression may mean. The only coastline on which one can find a
                      slight concavity in East Africa is that of Tanzania; but this country is not
                      a party to the dispute before the Court. The coastline of Tanzania
                      has nothing to do with a maritime delimitation between Somalia and
                      Kenya.

                      East African coast which the three States share. Thus, it is stated in para-
                      graph 168: “The potential cut-off of Kenya’s maritime entitlements can-
                      not be properly observed by examining the coasts of Kenya and Somalia
                      in isolation. When the mainland coasts of Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania
                      are observed together, as a whole, the coastline is undoubtedly concave”.
                      From this observation, which practically includes the Tanzanian coast
                      into the area to be delimited, contrary to the long-­standing practice of the
                      Court, the conclusion is drawn that “Kenya faces a cut-off of its mari-
                      time entitlements as the middle State located between Somalia and Tan-
                      zania”.
                         29. According to this reasoning, a strict equidistance line would be
                      suitable for the delimitation of the coasts of Kenya and Somalia alone
                      since they show no observable concavity when taken by themselves; but
                      when the coast of Tanzania is taken into account, such an equidistance
                      line would create a disadvantage for Kenya. This means that the Court
                      has to take the coastline of a third State — not party to the dispute or to
                      this case — into account in order to justify this artificial disadvantage
                      which Kenya would suffer if an unadjusted equidistance line were used.
                      However, what is overlooked by this erroneous analysis is that, for a con-
                      cavity and its potential cut-off effect to be taken into account as a relevant
                      circumstance in the delimitation of maritime areas, it must be rooted in
                      the coastline of one of the Parties. The involvement in the delimitation
                      process of coasts other than those of the Parties will have the effect of
                      extending the area to be delimited to a coastline which has in fact nothing
                      to do with it.
                         30. As was observed by Judge Koretsky in the North Sea Continental
                      Shelf cases, macrogeographical considerations are “entirely irrelevant” in
                      maritime delimitation, “except in the improbable framework of a desire
                      to redraw the political map of one or more regions of the world” 21. The
                      arbitrary refashioning of geography to achieve preconceived results does
