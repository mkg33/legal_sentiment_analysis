Case one of eight similar cases brought by the Applicant — Court to consider
arguments put forward in this case as well as any other legal issue, including
issues raised in other seven cases.

* +

Contentions by Respondents that case should be dismissed in limine litis as a
result of Applicant’s changed attitude to Court’s jurisdiction in its Observations.

Whether Applicant’s changed attitude amounts to discontinuance — Appli-
cant expressly denied notice of discontinuance and wants the Court to decide
upon its jurisdiction — Court unable to treat Observations as having legal effect
of discontinuance — Court has power, ex officio, to put an end to a case in
interests of proper administration of justice — Not applicable in present case.

Whether Applicant’s position discloses substantive agreement on jurisdiction
resulting in absence of dispute for purposes of Article 36, paragraph 6, of
Statute — Distinction to be drawn between question of jurisdiction and right
of party to appear before the Court under the Statute — Latter not a matter
of consent — Court must reach its own conclusion.

Court cannot decline to entertain case because of a suggestion as to motives
of one of the parties or because its judgment may have influence in another case.

Whether, in light of Applicant’s contention that it was not party to the Geno-
cide Convention until March 2001, the substantive dispute with the Respondent,



in so far as jurisdiction is founded on that Convention, has disappeared — Con-
tention that Applicant has forfeited right of action and is estopped from pursu-
ing the proceedings — No withdrawal of claims as to merits — Applicant
cannot be held to have renounced its rights or to be estopped from continuing the
action.

Questions of jurisdiction — Court’s “freedom to select the ground upon which
it will base its judgment” — Distinction between present proceedings and other
cases — Applicant’s right of access to Court under Article 35, paragraph 1, of
Statute, challenged — If not party to Statute at time of institution of proceed-
ings, subject to application of Article 35, paragraph 2, Applicant had no right to
appear before Court — Court must determine whether Applicant meets condi-
tions laid down in Articles 34 and 35 of Statute before examining conditions in
Article 36 of Statute.

Break-up of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992 — Dec-
laration of 27 April 1992 and Note of same date from Permanent Representa-
tive of Yugoslavia to the United Nations, addressed to Secretary-General —
Security Council resolution 757 of 30 May 1992 — Security Council resolu-
tion 777 of 19 September 1992 — General Assembly resolution 4711 of 22 Sep-
tember 1992 — Legal Counsel's letter of 29 September 1992 regarding “prac-
tical consequences” of General Assembly resolution 4711 — General Assembly
resolution 471229 of 29 April 1993.

Complexity and ambiguity of legal position of FRY within and vis-à-vis the
United Nations during the period 1992-2000 — Absence of authoritative deter-
mination by competent United Nations organs.

Different positions taken within United Nations — Positions of Security
Council and General Assembly — Resolution 777 (1992) and resolution 47/1
cannot be construed as conveying an authoritative determination of FRY s legal
status — Position of FRY — Maintained claim of continuity of legal personal-
ity of SFRY as stated in Note of 27 April 1992 — Position of Secretariat —
Adherence to practice prevailing prior to break-up of SFRY pending authorita-
tive determination of FRY's legal status.

Reference by Court to “sui generis” position of FRY in Judgment of 3 Feb-
ruary 2003 in Application for Revision case — Term not prescriptive but
merely descriptive of amorphous situation — No conclusion drawn by Court as
to status of FRY vis-à-vis the United Nations in 2003 Judgment or in incidental
proceedings in other cases including Order on provisional measures in present
case.


FRY's sui generis position came to end with admission to United Nations on

Question whether Court open to Applicant under Article 35, paragraph 2, of
Statute — Contention by certain Respondents that Applicant may not rely on
this text — Appropriate for Court to examine question.

Scope of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Determination by Court in provisional
measures Order of April 1993 in Genocide Convention case that Article TX of
the Genocide Convention “could . . . be regarded prima facie as a special provi-
sion contained in a treaty in force” — Contentions by certain Respondents that
“treaties in force” relates only to treaties in force when Statute came into force.

Natural and ordinary meaning allows two different interpretations: treaties in
force at time when Statute came into force and treaties in force at date of insti-
tution of proceedings — Object and purpose of Article 35 is to define conditions
of access to Court: natural to reserve position in relation to treaties that might
then exist, not to allow States to obtain access to Court by conclusion between
themselves of any special treaty — First interpretation reinforced by examina-
tion of travaux préparatoires — Substantially same provision in PCIJ Statute
intended to refer to special provisions in Peace Treaties concluded after First
World War — No discussion in travaux of ICJ Statute to suggest that exten-
sion of access to Court intended.

Genocide Convention came into force after Statute — Not “treaty in force”
within meaning of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Unnecessary to decide whether
Applicant was party to Genocide Convention on 29 April 1999.

+

In view of Court’s conclusion of lack of access to Court under either para-
graph 1 or paragraph 2 of Article 35 of Statute, unnecessary for Court to con-
sider Respondents’ other preliminary objections.

Distinction between existence of jurisdiction and compatibility of acts with
international law — Irrespective of whether Court has jurisdiction, Parties
remain responsible for acts attributable to them that violate the rights of other



States — In present case, having no jurisdiction, Court can make no finding on
such matters.
