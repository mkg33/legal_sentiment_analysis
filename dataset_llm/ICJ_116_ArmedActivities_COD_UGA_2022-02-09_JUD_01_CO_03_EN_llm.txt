                         1. Although I voted in favour of the award by the Court of US$225 mil-
                      lion as compensation for damage to persons, I wish to make some obser-
                      vations about the reasoning employed by the Court to arrive at that sum,
                      its treatment of the standard of proof at the reparations phase and the
                      compensability of macroeconomic damage.


                              The Court’s Approach to the Award of Compensation

                         2. The Court’s basic approach to the award of compensation is set out
                      in paragraph 106 as follows:
                            “[t]he Court may, on an exceptional basis, award compensation in the
                            form of a global sum, within the range of possibilities indicated by
                            the evidence and taking account of equitable considerations. Such an
                            approach may be called for where the evidence leaves no doubt that
                            an internationally wrongful act has caused a substantiated injury, but
                            does not allow a precise evaluation of the extent or scale of such
                            injury.”
                         3. The head of damage, damages to persons, has five categories of inju-
                      ries, namely, loss of life, injuries to persons, rape and sexual violence,
                      recruitment and deployment of child soldiers, and displacement of popu-
                      lations. In respect of each category, after analysing the extent and valua-
                      tion of the damage or injury, the Court decided to award compensation
                      for each category of injury as part of a global sum. The Court did not fix
                      compensation for each category of injury, and ultimately awarded what it
                      described as a global sum of US$225 million for damage to persons. In
                      this opinion in relation to this case, the term “heads of damages” is taken
                      as applying to damage to persons, damage to property, damage to natu-
                      ral resources and macroeconomic damage. However, damage to persons
                      has the five categories of injuries stated above.

                      by the Court on the EECC’s Award is wholly misplaced. The Court states
                      that in respect of cases of mass casualties resulting from an armed con-
                      flict, “the judicial or other bodies concerned have awarded a global sum,
                      for certain categories of injury, on the basis of the evidence at their dis-
                      posal” (Judgment, para. 107). It then refers to the EECC’s Final Award
                      on Eritrea’s Damages Claims (2009) 1. Although the language in that
                      paragraph does not mean that the Court was implying that the EECC
                      used the term “global sum”, it must be clarified that that term is not used
                      by the Commission in any part of its Award. An examination of that
                      Award shows that the EECC did not do anything that was remotely sim-
                      ilar to what the Court has done in this case. The EECC awarded compen-
                      sation in the form of a specific sum for each category of injury and then
                      made a final award that reflected an aggregation of those specific sums,
                      which it simply described as the “total monetary compensation”. For
                      example, in respect of rape, the Commission awarded a specific sum of
                      US$2 million, which it added to the other sums awarded for the other
                      categories of injuries making a grand total of US$161,455,000. It is inap-
                      propriate to describe the award of US$2 million as a global sum, thereby
                      suggesting that the EECC’s approach to compensation was similar to
                      that of the Court. It is nothing of the sort, because, unlike the EECC, the
                      Court does not award a specific sum for any of the five categories of inju-
                      ries in respect of damage to persons; it awards what it describes as a
                      global sum.

                        7. The Court’s use of the concept of an award of compensation within
                      the range of possibilities indicated by the evidence appears to have been
                      inspired by the EECC’s Eritrea Damages Claims Award, in which the
                      phrase is used twice. Page 508 of the Award reads,
                               “The Commission required clear and convincing evidence that
                            damage occurred, but less rigorous proof for purposes of the quanti-
                            fication of damages which requires exercises of judgment and approx-
                            imation. In commercial arbitration, lack of evidence may warrant
                            dismissal of a damages claim for failure of proof. In contrast, when
                            serious violations of international law, causing harm to many indi-
                            viduals, have been determined, it would be inappropriate to dismiss
                            the claim outright. The Commission recognized its obligation
                            to ­determine appropriate compensation, even if the process involves
                            estimation or guesswork within the range of possibilities indicated by
                            the evidence. The Commission further took into account a trade-off
                            fundamental to recent international efforts to address injuries affect-
                            ing large number of victims. Compensation levels were thus reduced,
                            balancing uncertainties flowing from the lower standard of proof.” 2

                      Paragraphs 37 and 38 of the Award also explain the Commission’s under-
                      standing of the concept. The language in these paragraphs is essentially
                      the same as that on page 508. Considering that the Award on Eritrea’s
                      Damages Claims is cited favourably seven times in the Judgment, it is
                      surprising that the Court has not followed the Commission’s approach to
                      determining compensation.
                         8. Four points may be made about the manner in which the Commis-
                      sion uses the term “within the range of possibilities indicated by the evi-
                      dence”, which distinguishes it from the Court’s approach. The first point
                      is that, as indicated below, the Commission is careful to set the context in
                      which recourse may be had to the concept of an award of compensation
                      within the range of possibilities indicated by the evidence:

                        (i) the quantification of damages for serious violations of international
                            law resulting in harm to individuals calls for the exercise of judgment
                            and approximation, particularly in relation to mass conflicts, which
                            inevitably lead to uncertainties with regard to the extent and valua-
                            tion of damage;
                       (ii) in light of this particular context, there is a lower standard of proof
                            at the reparations phase;
                      (iii) in applying that lower standard of proof, a court or tribunal has an
                            “obligation to determine appropriate compensation, even if the
                            ­process involves estimation or guesswork within the range of pos­
                             sibilities indicated by the evidence” 3; and
                      (iv) the trade-off for a court or tribunal relying on estimation or guess-
                            work of compensation due in a case of mass casualties such as a war
                            is that compensation may be reduced.

                         The Court’s use of the concept does not reveal any sensitivity to that
                      context which the Commission was careful to identify for its use. In par-
                      ticular, no sensitivity is shown by the Court to the linkage between the
                      use of the concept and the lower standard of proof at the reparations
                      phase. In the vast majority of instances where the Court finds that the
                      evidence does not allow it to even approximate the extent of the damage,
                      the evidence is such that had the Court been sensitive to the lower stan-
                      dard of proof, it would have been in a position either by estimation or
                      guesswork to determine the extent and valuation of the damage; nor does
                      the Court’s approach reveal any sensitivity to reducing the compensation
                      sum as a trade-off for “uncertainties flowing from the lower standard of
                      proof” 4. This trade-off is described by the Commission as “fundamental
                      to recent international efforts to address injuries reflecting large numbers

                      of victims” 5. The opinion will later address issues relating to the standard
                      of proof.

                      Court does not see itself as having an obligation to determine appropriate
                      compensation even if it has to use estimation or guesswork within the
                      range of possibilities indicated by the evidence. It is odd that the Court
                      seizes on the last part of the Commission’s dictum — within the range of
                      possibilities indicated by the evidence — but ignores the first part which
                      refers to the obligation to determine appropriate compensation by esti-
                      mation or even by guesswork. The Commission’s approach calls for
                      action by the tribunal to determine appropriate compensation even by
                      estimation or guesswork, but places a restraint on that action. By ignor-
                      ing that obligation, the Court has not followed the Commission’s
                      approach on the nine occasions that the Judgment uses the phrase “within
                      the range of possibilities indicated by the evidence”. It would seem that
                      the Court is still searching for a precision in the evidence that the law
                      does not require. The Court does not appear to acknowledge that the
                      quantification of damages in situations of mass casualties resulting from
                      a war requires what the Commission calls “exercises of judgment
                      and approximation”. Regrettably, the Court appears to approach the
                      reliability of the evidence for the purpose of determining the extent and
                      valuation of the damage or injury with the rigour of an insurer examining
                      a claim for damages arising from an accident between two motor
                      vehicles.



                        13. Compensation is based on a determination of the extent of damage
                      or injury and its valuation. If the determination of the extent of damage
                      or injury is wrong, compensation based on the valuation will also be
                      wrong. Since the Court awards compensation for each category of injury
                      as part of a global sum, it is reasonable to expect that when added





6 Ord_1239.indb 318                                                                                 27/06/23 08:16

                      Court states that there is a range but does not identify the range. Although
                      two numbers, 1,800 and 2,500, are indicated in paragraph 204 on the
                      recruitment of child soldiers, there is nothing to show how these numbers
                      could constitute a range. The Court’s approach would have been more
                      comprehensible if it had identified a range in respect of all five categories
                      of injuries. Regrettably, since the Court’s assessment of the extent of the
                      damage is open to criticism, its global award of compensation of
                      US$225 million is also open to question.


                         15. It is regrettable that the Court does not explain the concept of the
                      global sum. Although the concept, as developed by the Court, suggests
                      that the addition of the five parts in respect of the categories of injuries
                      constitutes the global sum, the analysis above shows that the five parts
                      are not susceptible to addition. In any event, as noted before, the Court’s
                      use of the concept of the global sum does not appear to allow a specific
                      determination of compensation for each category of injury; if it did, the
                      final award would not be global. However, the dilemma is that, absent an
                      award for each category of injury, the global sum is difficult to compre-
                      hend and appears to be snatched from thin air. Thus, the global sum is
                      incompatible with a specific determination of compensation for each cat-
                      egory of injury but is incomprehensible without such a determination.
                      Another difficulty is that, since compensation is awarded for each of the
                      five categories of injuries as part of the global sum, it is evident that the
                      global sum may be partitioned, thereby implying that it is capable of dis-
                      aggregation, with the result that the sum loses its global character.


                         16. By stating that it may exceptionally award compensation in the
                      form of a global sum, the Court acknowledges that the more usual prac-
                      tice is for a final award of compensation to reflect the aggregation of
                      specific awards for each category of injury. In my view, Democratic
                      Republic of the Congo v. Uganda was not an appropriate case to depart
                      from the more usual practice. This is a case in which the Court has found
                      that one Party has committed breaches not only of international humani-

                         17. The concept of the global sum has been used in investment arbitra-
                      tion — see for example, Blount Brothers Corporation v. Iran 7 and Adam
                      Joseph Resources v. CNA Metals 8 in which each Tribunal awarded a
                      global sum for all costs claimed by the claimant; however, in that field,
                      which is largely concerned with commercial and investment activities, it
                      does not present the substantive and presentational problems that arise in
                      a case relating to the loss of life, injuries to persons and the other catego-
                      ries of injuries in this case. In light of all the difficulties presented by the
                      concept of the global sum, it has to be questioned whether it is an appro-
                      priate tool for the discharge by the Court of its judicial function.

                      the evidence provides certainty as to damage caused by the wrongful con-
                      duct of a respondent, but no certainty as to the extent of that damage. In
                      that regard, in Certain Activities (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) the Court
                      cited the following passage from Story Parchment, cited in Trail Smelter:

                               “Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascer-
                            tainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it would be a
                            perversion of fundamental principles of justice to deny all relief to the
                            injured person, and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from making any
                            amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages may not be deter-
                            mined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the evidence
                            show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable
                            inference, although the result be only approximate.” 9

                         20. In Al-Jedda, the European Court of Human Rights relied on Arti-
                      cle 41 of the European Convention, which allows it to “afford just satis-
                      faction” to an injured party in circumstances where the domestic law only
                      allows partial reparation. In Diallo, the Court cited the following passage
                      from Al-Jedda v. United Kingdom: “[i]ts guiding principle is equity, which
                      above all involves flexibility and an objective consideration of what is
                      just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, including not
                      only the position of the applicant but the overall context in which the
                      breach occurred” 10. Although Al-Jedda was a case involving non-­material
                      harm, the elements of the principle of equity that are identified — flexibil-
                      ity, fairness and reasonableness in all the circumstances of the case — are
                      equally applicable to a claim for material harm. It is significant that the
                      European Court highlights the element of flexibility, which, while it does
                      not allow for wild approximations, does allow the Court to make a rea-
                      sonable approximation of the extent and valuation of the damage.


                         21. That the Court’s jurisprudence is consistent with the use of the
                      principle of equitable considerations to arrive at approximate determina-
                      tions of the extent of the damage is evident from its finding in Certain
                      Activities that “the absence of certainty as to the extent of damage did not
                      necessarily preclude it from awarding an amount that it considered
                      approximately to reflect the value of the impairment or loss of environ-
                      mental goods or services” 11. The principle of equitable considerations,
                      therefore, allows the Court to approximate the valuation of the damage
                      suffered in cases where there is certainty that there was some damage, but
                      none as to its extent. It is in such circumstances that an award of compen-
                      sation is made on the basis of equitable considerations. The Court, if it
                      applies the principle of equitable considerations, is not required to be pre-
                      cise in its determination of either the number of victims or its valuation of
                      the damage suffered.

                        23. It is noteworthy that, against the background of a total lack of

                      tion on the basis of equitable considerations or for the sum it awarded.
                      The Court did nothing more than outline the facts of the case and then
                      announce its decision to award compensation on the basis of equitable
                      considerations. That, of course, does not mean that the Court’s decision
                      was unreasoned, because it was within the Court’s power to award com-
                      pensation in the particular circumstances of a case, applying the elements
                      of flexibility, fairness and reasonableness.
                         24. It is acknowledged that, in contradistinction to Diallo, which
                      addresses compensation for a single individual, the present case relates to
                      mass casualties in an armed conflict. However, Diallo establishes a prin-
                      ciple whereby the Court can arrive at an approximation of the damage
                      and correspondingly make an award of compensation. This principle is as
                      applicable to mass casualties as it is to a single individual, although, con-
                      cededly, its application will be more difficult in relation to the former.
                      Indeed, its application is particularly appropriate in the context of a mass

                      value of the loss suffered by the company. Again, like the Court in Diallo,

                      it is noteworthy that, in the face of a total lack of any evidence as to the
                      valuation of the loss suffered by the company, the IACtHR did not offer
                      any specific reason either for awarding compensation on the basis of equi-
                      table considerations or for the sum it awarded.

                        26. In Diallo, the Court specifically cited paragraphs 240 and 242 of
                      Chaparro which read:
                                “240. The representatives did not present any supporting documen-
                            tation that would allow the Court to establish the value of Mr. Lapo’s
                            house. Consequently, the Court decides, in equity, to establish the
                            sum of US$20,000.00, (twenty thousand United States dollars). The
                            State must pay this amount to Mr. Lapo within one year of notifica-
                            tion of this judgment.
                            �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                                242. The amount requested for [Chaparro’s apartment] is
                            US$135,729.07 (one hundred and thirty-five thousand seven hundred
                            and twenty-nine United States dollars and seven cents). From the evi-
                            dence provided, the Court is unable to establish clearly the basis used
                            by the expert to establish that the apartment was worth this amount,
                            since no additional evidence or arguments have been submitted by the
                            representatives in this regard. Therefore, it decides to establish, in
                            equity, the amount of US$40,000.00 (forty thousand United States
                            dollars), which the State must deliver to Mr. Chaparro to compensate
                            him for the loss of his apartment. The State must pay this amount to
                            Mr. Chaparro within one year of notification of this judgment.” 21
                         27. Chaparro provides a very strong precedent for the Court to arrive
                      at an approximate sum as compensation for injuries suffered by the DRC,
                      because in relation to Mr. Lapo’s house there was no supporting docu-
                      mentation that allowed the Inter-­American Court to establish its value.
                      Nonetheless, that court awarded the sum of US$20,000. Further, although
                      the IACtHR found the expert evidence in relation to the value of
                      Mr. Chaparro’s apartment to be wholly unhelpful, it “establish[ed], in
                      equity, the amount of US$40,000” as compensation. It is quite likely that
                      the Court cited this case because it felt that the principle of equity, on the
                      basis of which the Inter-­American Court acted, had elements that were
                      similar to the principle of equitable considerations it applied in Diallo.


                        28. As in Diallo, the IACtHR did not offer any specific reason either
                      for awarding compensation on the basis of equity or for the sum it
                      awarded. It outlined the facts and thereafter awarded compensation on
                      the basis of equity, although it had no supporting evidence whatsoever in

                      relation to the value of the house and the apartment, the principle of


                            “in the circumstances[, has] sought to develop a reasonable estimate
                            of the losses resulting from the injuries it found, taking account of the
                            likely population of the affected areas and estimates of the frequency
                            and extent of loss. This process was unavoidably imprecise and uncer-
                            tain, but it was necessary given the limitations of the record.” 22

                      The element of reasonableness on which the Commission relied is a sig-
                      nificant component of the principle of equitable considerations; it is
                      equally clear that this element allows a court or tribunal to navigate areas
                      of uncertainty and imprecision in the evidence with a view to fixing a sum
                      for compensation.

                                Conclusions on the Principle of Equitable Considerations
                         31. When the Court applies the principle of equitable considerations, it
                      is applying equity intra legem, equity within the law; in particular, it is
                      applying equity in the manner that Professor Francesco Francioni has
                      described it: “as a method for infusing elements of reasonableness and
                      ‘individualized’ justice whenever the applicable law leaves a margin of
                      discretion to the court or tribunal which has to make the decision” 23. It is
                      not applying equity contra legem, an example of which is the power given
                      to the Court under Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court to
                      determine a case ex aequo et bono if it has the consent of the parties to do
                      so. In sum, therefore, the elements of the principle of equitable consider-
                      ations are reasonableness, flexibility, judgment, approximation and fair-
                      ness. Consequently, the Court’s finding that it may form an appreciation
                      of the extent of damage is nothing but an illustration of the principle of
                      equitable considerations, which allows for reasonableness and judgment,
                      as indicated by the EECC, and flexibility, as indicated by the European
                      Court of Human Rights in Al-Jedda. Another important feature of the

                      principle of equitable considerations is that the court or tribunal, in
                      applying that principle, becomes actively engaged with the evidence so as
                      to estimate a sum for compensation, or, in the language of the EECC, “to
                      determine appropriate compensation”. The EECC sees this activity as
                      obligatory, even if it calls for estimation or guesswork, albeit an estima-
                      tion that is restrained by the range of possibilities indicated by the evi-
                      dence. It does not appear that the Court was prepared to become
                      sufficiently engaged with the evidence so as to estimate a sum for compen-
                      sation.


                                Application of the Principle of Equitable Considerations
                                                to the Facts of the Case
                         32. Had the Court applied the principle of equitable considerations, it
                      would have been able to determine a specific sum for compensation in
                      practically every case in which the DRC made a claim for compensation.
                      In those cases, the Court had before it, evidence from the DRC as to the
                      extent of damage or injury and the valuation of the damage or injury. It
                      also had before it, evidence from its own experts as well as from
                      United Nations bodies and non-­governmental organizations. Whenever
                      the Court has evidence of that kind before it, it is always in a position to
                      weigh the varying proposals from the parties and others and determine a
                      sum for compensation on the basis of equitable considerations. Even if
                      the Court only has evidence from the applicant and the respondent, or
                      from one party alone, by becoming actively engaged with the evidence, it
                      is in a position to determine a sum for compensation on the basis of equi-
                      table considerations. It is not the case, as the Court asserts in relation to
                      loss of life, injuries to persons, and rape, that the evidence did not allow
                      it to even approximate the number of persons or injuries involved. Eritrea
                      and Ethiopia, like the DRC and Uganda, are poor, developing countries
                      with relatively limited infrastructural facilities, and it is therefore not sur-
                      prising that, except in relation to evidence for damage to buildings, the
                      evidence before the EECC was of the same quality as the evidence before
                      the Court. Nonetheless, the EECC found it possible in respect of all the
                      claims, except for those dismissed for lack of evidence, to fix a sum as
                      compensation on the basis of a reasonable estimate.



                         33. For example, Eritrea sought compensation for injury resulting
                      from rape 24. It provided very little evidence as to the extent
                      of the damage (i.e. number of women raped) or the valuation
                      of the injury. Rather, Eritrea proposed that each party set aside an esti-
                      mated US$500,000 to US$1,000,000 to fund locally administered

                         34. In light of the lack of evidence, the Commission faced similar chal-
                      lenges to the Court in assessing the DRC’s claims for damage to persons
                      resulting from rape. Like the Court, the Commission noted “the cultural
                      sensitivities surrounding rape in both countries and the unwillingness of
                      victims to come forward” 26. As such, the Commission “ha[d] no illusion
                      that the record before it reveals the full scope of rape during the extended
                      armed conflict” 27. The Commission was, therefore, “acutely aware that
                      the full number of victims and the full magnitude of the harm they suf-
                      fered cannot and will not ever be known” 28. The parties similarly failed to
                      “provide the Commission with an agreed or useful methodology for
                      assessing compensation” 29.

                          35. However, the Commission’s award of compensation for rape
                      reflected a reliance on the elements of judgment and flexibility that is
                      missing in the Court’s determination of compensation for the same cat­
                      egory of injury. The Commission found that it was “predictable that each
                      Party failed to prove its damages claim for rape, either as to a reasonable
                      number of victims or as to a reasonable measure of economic harm” 30.
                       The Commission did not find it strange that the parties failed to identify
                       a sum to reflect the extent or valuation of the harm caused by rape,
                       because it was willing to accept the responsibility to determine appropri-
                      ate compensation. It rejected Eritrea’s proposal because it was
                      ­“presented . . . without explanation” 31, and found that such amounts
                       did not provide sufficient support for rape victims 32. Importantly, the
                      Commission “consider[ed] that this serious violation of international
                      humanitarian law demand[ed] serious relief” 33. In order to adequately
                       compensate for the acute harm of rape, the Commission became so
                       actively engaged with the evidence that it awarded US$2 million to
                       Eritrea, for Ethiopia’s failure to prevent the rape of known and unknown
                       victims in Eritrea; this sum was in excess of Eritrea’s own proposal 34. In
                       making this award, the Commission obviously took into account that
                       “the record before it” did not reveal “the full scope of rape during the
                       extended armed conflict”.

                         36. The evidence relating to rape provides an illustration of a case in
                      which the Court could certainly have fixed a sum as compensation on the
                      basis of equitable considerations. The DRC relied on the finding by Con-
                      golese investigators of 342 cases of rape. However, it correctly concluded
                      that that sum was an undercount for a variety of reasons, including the
                      common practice of rape during the war and the well-known cultural ten-
                      dency among victims not to report rape. Consequently, in order to take
                      account of those factors the DRC multiplied the number of 342 by five
                      and claimed compensation for 1,740 cases of rape and sexual violence. It
                      must be acknowledged that this was not a satisfactory approach. How-
                      ever, there was evidence before the Court that would have allowed it to
                      award compensation for the rape of an identified number of victims on
                      the basis of equitable considerations. Instead, the Court found that there
                      was a significant number of victims of rape and sexual violence. While it
                      was correct for the Court not to accept the number of 1,740 cases of rape
                      as submitted by the DRC, it was certainly in a position to accept that
                      there were more than 342 such cases and identify a number that would
                      form the basis for the valuation of the injury, for the following reasons.
                      First, the Court had the uncontradicted statement by the DRC that for
                      cultural reasons cases of rape and sexual violence are under-­reported.
                      Second, the DRC’s submission that rape and sexual violence were wide-
                      spread weapons of war in Ituri is supported by the ICC’s confirmation
                      that it was a “common practice” in that district (The Prosecutor v.
                      Bosco Ntaganda, ICC-01/04-02/06). Third, it had the statement of the
                      MONUC special report on the events in Ituri that “[c]ountless women
                      were abducted and became ‘war wives’, while others were raped or sexu-
                      ally abused before being released”. Fourth, proof in this phase of the pro-
                      ceedings does not require the same degree of certainty as the merits phase,
                      addressing responsibility for wrongful conduct. The Court can be satis-
                      fied by proof on a balance of probabilities. These four factors provide a
                      sound basis for a conclusion that there were more than 342 cases of sex-
                      ual violence. The Court was in a position to identify a number higher
                      than 342 and award a sum for compensation on the basis of equitable
                      considerations.

                        38. A general comment that may be made is that the Court should
                      have become more active and more engaged in fixing compensation by





6 Ord_1239.indb 338                                                                                 27/06/23 08:16

                      explanation is offered for the Court not following its approach in Diallo
                      and Certain Activities. It is certain, however, that the approach adopted
                      by the Court of awarding compensation taking into account equitable
                      considerations means that it would not have had the full benefit of the
                      principle. An award of compensation that only takes into account equi-
                      table considerations merely treats equitable considerations as an element
                      in the determination of that award whereas an award of compensation
                      based on equitable considerations is one that is governed by the principle
                      of equitable considerations.

                                                   Standard of Proof

                         41. The Court rightly concluded that the standard of proof at the mer-
                      its phase is higher than it is at the reparations phase. However, it does not
                      explicitly identify the lower standard applicable to the reparations phase.
                      That omission may be overlooked if the findings of the Court on ques-
                      tions of compensation are consistent with the use of a lower standard of
                      proof. As noted before, where the Court has found that the evidence was
                      not sufficient to determine a reasonably precise or even an approximate
                      number of lives lost or persons injured, a finding could have been made
                      that the evidence was sufficient for that purpose on the basis of the lower

                      standard of proof. For example, in relation to loss of life, the Court con-
                      cludes that the evidence was not sufficient to determine a reasonably pre-
                      cise or even an approximate number of lives lost. The Court identifies a
                      range of lives lost from 10,000 to 15,000. There can be no doubt that on
                      the basis of the lower standard of proof the Court would have been in a
                      position to estimate the number of lives lost. Thus, if the Court deter-
                      mined that 12,000 lives were lost on a lower standard of proof such as a
                      balance of probabilities its decision would be correct, because the evi-
                      dence supports the conclusion that it was more probable than not that
                      12,000 lives were lost. One could arrive at the same conclusion on every
                      occasion when the Court concluded that there was not sufficient evidence
                      to even approximate the extent of the injury.




                         42. Moreover, there are instances in which the Court has used a stan-
                      dard of proof that is questionable because a lower standard should have
                      been used in relation to the extent or valuation of damage or injury. Para-
                      graph 163 states: “Turning to valuation, the Court considers that the
                      DRC has not presented convincing evidence for its claim that the average
                      amount awarded by Congolese courts to the families of victims of war
                      crimes amounts to US$34,000.” Paragraph 180 states: “The DRC does
                      not provide convincing evidence that these figures are derived from the
                      average amounts awarded by Congolese courts in the context of the per-
                      petration of serious international crimes.” Paragraph 205 states: “In the
                      framework of the present reparation proceedings, these methodologies do
                      not provide a sufficient basis for assigning a specific valuation of damage
                      in respect of a child soldier.” Paragraph 243 reads: “In the Court’s view,
                      the DRC offers no convincing evidence for the number of 8,693 private
                      dwellings that it claims have been destroyed in Ituri.” Paragraph 248
                      states: “With regard to the valuation of the property lost, the Court con-
                      siders that the DRC has not provided convincing evidence supporting the
                      alleged average value of private dwellings, public buildings and property
                      looted.” Paragraph 307 states: “The Court considers that the figures put
                      forward by the DRC with respect to the quantity and value of exploited
                      diamonds for which Uganda owes reparation are not based on a convinc-
                      ing methodological approach, in particular because the DRC relies on
                      insufficient and uncorroborated data.” Paragraph 319 states: “The evi-
                      dence furnished by the DRC does not provide a convincing basis for its
                      claim of US$2,915,880 for coltan.” Finally, paragraph 340 states: “The
                      methodology applied by the DRC to substantiate its claim is not convinc-
                      ing.”

                        44. Notably, the Court did not rule on the question whether macro­
                      economic damage was compensable under international law; it found
                      that the DRC had not established the required causal nexus between
                      Uganda’s wrongful conduct and the alleged macroeconomic damage.

                         45. In my view, macroeconomic damage is compensable. In the first
                      place, recourse may be had to the general principle of full compensation
                      that was reflected in the Factory at Chorzów case as well as Articles 31
                      and 36 of the ILC Draft Articles 38. In Factory at Chorzów, the Court held
                      that “reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of
                      the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probabil-
                      ity, have existed if that act had not been committed” 39. This is the classi-
                      cal statement of the principle of full reparation which would certainly
                      include damage at the macroeconomic level resulting from an interna-
                      tionally wrongful act. Second, the principle of full reparation is also
                      reflected in Article 31 (1) of the ILC Draft Articles which provides that
                      “[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for
                      the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act”. It is difficult to
                      understand why, in principle, the kind of damage to the economy of a
                      country that could be caused by a war, in which thousands died and were
                      injured and which lasted five years, would not be compensable under
                      international law. A war can so shock the economic foundations of a
                      State that damage at the macroeconomic level, for example, in relation to
                      the value of its currency, is bound to ensue. Third, under Article 36 of the

                      ILC’s Draft Articles the responsible State has a duty to provide compen-
                      sation, which covers any financially assessable damage including loss of
                      profits in so far as it is established. Paragraph 5 of the commentary on
                      Article 36 states that financially assessable damage is “any damage which
                      is capable of being evaluated in financial terms”. There is no reason why
                      macroeconomic damage caused by a war should not be capable of being
                      evaluated in financial terms. Criticisms were levelled by economists on
                      behalf of Uganda at the Kinshasa study that was presented on behalf of
                      the DRC to establish the macroeconomic damage that it claimed. Not-
                      withstanding these criticisms, it is certainly possible that economic studies
                      could be presented to a court or tribunal substantiating macroeconomic
                      damage caused by a war. As a matter of law, such damage is compensa-
                      ble.
                         46. The Court dismissed the DRC’s claim for macroeconomic damage
                      on the ground that the DRC had not established a sufficiently direct and
                      certain causal nexus between the internationally wrongful act of Uganda
                      and any alleged macroeconomic damage. It is not clear whether in this
                      finding the Court applied the lower standard of proof at the reparations
                      phase. For example, if the standard of proof on the balance of probabili-
                      ties were applied, it would be reasonable to conclude that, on the basis of
                      the evidence in this case, the DRC established that there was a causal
                      nexus between the macroeconomic damage that the DRC alleged it had
                      suffered and the war. Using that standard, the DRC would have suc-
                      ceeded in establishing this nexus by showing that it was more probable
                      than not that there was a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus
                      between the internationally wrongful conduct of Uganda and the macro-
                      economic damage it claimed.
                         47. In conclusion, questions may be raised about the reasoning
                      employed by the Court to arrive at a global sum of US$225 million as
                      compensation for damage to persons and also about its treatment of the
                      standard of proof at the reparations phase.
