Although I agree with the above Judgment as a whole, I wish to make
my position clear in regard not only to certain points with which I fully
agree but also to some reservations which I have as to the reasoning and
the ultimate findings.

I. Locus STANDI IN JUDICIO OF SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO

1. Locus standi and Its Relationship to Jurisdiction ratione personae

1. In its original meaning’, the expression “locus standi in judicio”
implies the right of a person to appear or to be heard in such-and-such
proceedings (Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed, Vol. 2, p. 1115),
or, as regards the present Court, the right of a person lato sensu to
appear or to be heard in proceedings before the Court.

The right to appear before the International Court of Justice, due to
the fact that it is not a fully open court of law, is a limited right. The
limitations exist in two respects. Primo, the right is reserved for States
(Statute, Art. 34, para. 1). Consequently, it does not belong to other
juridical persons or physical persons. Secundo, as far as States are con-
cerned, only States parties to the Statute of the Court possess the right
referred to, being as Members of the United Nations ipso facto parties
to the Statute of the Court or by accepting conditions pursuant to
Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute. States non-parties to the Statute
can acquire this right on condition that they accept the general jurisdiction
of the Court in conformity with Security Council resolution 9 (1946).

From the substantive point of view, this right is a personal privilege
(privilegia favorabile) of the State which, by accepting the Statute of the
Court, has recognized the Court as a judicial body equipped with jus
dicere. It is the consequence of the burden — or privilegia odiosa — con-
sisting in fulfilment of the conditions prescribed.

Locus standi before the Court cannot, however, be taken as synony-
mous to the jurisdiction of the Court. It is, by its nature, a preliminary
condition or presumption for the jurisdiction of the Court or its compe-
tence. In this sense it is appropriate to speak about general jurisdiction
and special jurisdiction or competence of the Court. By possessing locus
standi a State automatically recognizes general jurisdiction of the Court.

In order to be able to speak about special jurisdiction or competence in
casu, however, it is necessary that, besides the right to appear before the
Court, there should exist a specific basis of jurisdiction. And it is on these
grounds that States submit a concrete dispute or type of disputes to the
Court for solution.

In other words, having in mind the fact that the Court is not only a
court of law whose jurisdiction is of an optional nature, but, at the same
time, a partly open court, it can be said that double consent of States is
necessary in order for the Court to establish its competence in casu:

(i) consent that the Court is “an organ instituted for the purpose of jus
dicere” (dissenting opinion by Dr. Daxner, Corfu Channel, LC.J.
Reports 1948, p. 39). This consent is expressed indirectly, by joining
the membership of the United Nations, or directly, by a non-
Member of the United Nations either by adhering to the Statute of
the Court or by accepting the general jurisdiction of the Court in
conformity with Security Council resolution 9 (1946) as a prelimi-
nary condition, and

(ii) consent that the Court is competent to deal with the particular
dispute or type of disputes, which is made through relevant juris-
dictional bases within Article 36 of the Statute as a substantive
but qualified condition?.

2. The notions locus standi in judicio and jurisdiction ratione personae
cannot, despite certain extrinsic similarities, be taken as synonymous.

The element shared in common by these two notions is that they rep-
resent processual conditions on whose existence is dependent the validity

2 As stated by the Court “under the system of the Statute the seising of the Court by
means of an Application is not ipso facto open to all States parties to the Statute, it is only
open to the extent defined in the applicable Declarations” (Nottebohm, Preliminary
Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122). It should be noted also that the Court
in the Legality of the Use of Force case found

“[w]hereas the Court, under its Statute, does not automatically have jurisdiction over
legal disputes between States parties to that Statute or between other States to whom
access to the Court has been granted . . . whereas the Court can therefore exercise
jurisdiction only between States parties to a dispute who not only have access to the
Court but also have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court, either in general form or
for the individual dispute concerned” (Provisional Measures, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I),
p. 370, para. 19; emphasis added).



of the actual proceedings before the Court; both with respect to inci-
dental proceedings and the merits, and with respect to the bringing of
the dispute to the Court’s decisions in the proceedings. And there the
common ground between the two notions essentially ends and room
for differences emerges.

The difference between the two is, first of all, of a conceptual nature.
Locus standi is a condition which has to do with parties, whereas jurisdic-
tion ratione personae — as an element of the jurisdiction of the Court —
is a condition which has to do with the Court itself. Also, the question of
locus standi as of antecedent nature is a pre-preliminary question which
“should be taken in advance of any question of competence” (Northern
Cameroons, 1.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 105, separate opinion of Sir Gerald
Fitzmaurice ; emphasis in the original), whereas jurisdiction ratione per-
sonae is a question of competence, or special jurisdiction of the Court
stricto sensu. Furthermore, a lack of locus standi cannot, as a rule, be
overcome in the proceedings while a lack of jurisdiction ratione personae
is surmountable since the parties may confer jurisdiction upon the Court
in the course of the proceedings or perfect it (for instance, by expressing
agreement or by forum prorogatum). The difference derives from the fact
that jurisdiction is governed by the law in force between the parties, while
locus standi is governed by objective rules of the Statute having a consti-
tutional nature.

3. The locus standi of Serbia and Montenegro in the present proceed-
ings before the Court is closely, and, I would say, organically, linked with
its membership in the United Nations, due to the fact that Serbia and
Montenegro could not be considered as being party to the Statute apart
from being a Member State of the United Nations as well as the fact that
its locus standi cannot be based on conditions set forth in Article 35, para-
graph 2, of the Statute of the Court.

4. In normal circumstances, the legal consequences of admission of a



State to membership in the United Nations are clear and do not require
special elaboration. At the moment of its admission to membership a
State becomes a bearer of the rights and obligations stipulated in the
United Nations Charter, among which of particular relevance in the
matter at hand is the status of a party to the Statute of the Court. How-
ever, the circumstances surrounding the case at hand could hardly be
termed normal. More precisely, the Applicant, Serbia and Montenegro,
was admitted to membership in the Organization on the basis of the
proper procedure. But this was done without its status in the Organization
being previously established in explicit terms either by the political
organs of the United Nations or by the Court.

5. United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/1 is unclear in sub-
stance and contradictory per se. Assessing its substance in the case con-
cerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide ( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Mon-
tenegro) (hereinafter referred to as “Genocide Convention”), the Court
found that “the solution adopted is not free from legal difficulties” (Pro-
visional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993, LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14,
para. 18). The situation was additionally complicated by the subsequent
practice of the United Nations organs “characterized by pragmatism and
flexibility rather than a strict adherence to the procedures” prescribed by
the Charter (Contributor (Christian Tams) on Article 6 (margin note 25)
in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations, A Commentary,
2nd ed., Vol. I, 2002, pp. 213-214). In 1993 Professor Rosalyn Higgins
wrote that “[t]he outcome has been anomalous in the extreme” (R. Hig-
gins, “The New United Nations and Former Yugoslavia”, International
Affairs, Vol. 69, No. 3 (July 1993), p. 479). It can, therefore, be con-
cluded that, until the admission of Serbia and Montenegro to member-
ship in the Organization on 1 November 2000, the political organs of the
United Nations had not determined the status of Serbia and Montenegro

(a) Findings of the Court based on “avoiding position”

7. In its Order of 2 June 1999 the Court stated that it “need not con-
sider this question for the purpose of deciding whether or not it can indi-
cate provisional measures in the present case” (I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I),
p. 136, para. 33). What we have here is a slightly modified formulation



expressing “avoiding position” of the Court with regard to the question
of “whether or not Yugoslavia is a Member of the United Nations, and as
such a party to the Statute of the Court” (Application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro) ), Provisional Meas-
ures, Order of 8 April 1993, LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 18) which
the Court used several times in the disputes to which Serbia and Mon-
tenegro is a party in the proceedings before the Court. The correctly inter-
preted formulation, regardless of modification in the specific cases, sug-
gests the conclusion that the Court reserved the right to state its definitive
position on the relevant question in the later phases of the proceedings.

It is easy to conclude that such a finding of the Court represents a
delay of the answer to the question “whether or not Yugoslavia is a
Member of the United Nations, and as such a party to the Statute of the

9. The Court was thus faced with a choice among possible solutions in
view of the fact that there existed at least a doubt regarding the legal posi-
tion of Yugoslavia diagnosed already in 1993 (Application of the Conven-
tion on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia
and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) ), Provisional
Measures, Order of 8 April 1993, 1. C.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 18):

(i) to ask for an authentic interpretation of resolution 47/1 from the
General Assembly as the competent organ of the United Nations;

(ii) to make its own interim determination of the matter either by
directing, on the basis of paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Rules
of Court, that the first pleading should be addressed to the



matter? or by instituting pre-judicatory proceedings on the basis
of Article 48 of the Statute; and

(iii) to resort to the judicial presumption of the right of Yugoslavia to
appear before the Court.

And the Court made the choice to rely on the presumption that Yugosla-
via was a Member of the United Nations and as such entitled to appear
before the Court (see dissenting opinion of Judge Vereshchetin appended
to the Judgment of 3 February 2003 in the case concerning Application
for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning
Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary
Objections ( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judgment, 1.C.J.
Reports 2003, p. 41, para. 4 (hereinafter referred to as the “Application
for Revision”); separate opinion of Judge Koroma, ibid., p. 36, para. 9).

its, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1949, p. 18). For legal presumption in the practice of the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, see T. Buergenthal, R. Norris and D. Shelton,
Protecting Human Rights in the Americas, Selected Problems, 2nd ed., 1986, pp. 130-132
and pp. 139-144. The practice of international courts abounds in presumptions based on
general principles of international law, whether positive as presumption of good faith
(exempli causa, Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions, Judgment No. 5, 1925, P.C.LJ,
Series A, No. 5, p. 43) or negative as presumption of abuse of right (Certain German
Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Merits, Judgment No. 7, 1926, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 7,
p. 30; Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Second Phase, 1930, P.C.LJ.,
Series A, No. 24, p. 12; Corfu Channel, Merits, Judgment, 1949, LC.J. Reports 1949,
p. 119, dissenting opinion of Judge Ecer). The special weight they possess in the interpre-
tation of treaties since the function of interpretation of treaties is to discover “what was,
or what may reasonably be presumed to have been, the intention of the parties to a treaty
when they concluded it” (Harvard Law School, Research in International Law, Part ITI,
Law of Treaties, Art. 19, p. 940; emphasis added).


The law, however much it tends to establish the truth and to be truth-
ful, actually pays more attention to finding useful and suitable solutions
for the given situations rather than allowing, in an attempt to establish
truth as such, the rights and obligations that exist to fall through or to be
harmed.

11. As a sort of presumption, the judicial presumption bears some spe-
cific features differing it from legal presumption (praesumptio juris).

Two principal features of judicial presumption should be mentioned in
that regard.

Primo, judicial presumption is, as a rule, a natural, factual presump-
tion (praesumptio facti vel homine) having no basis in the particular
rules that constitute the law of the international tribunal or the law it is


In its legal reasoning the international tribunal abandons it, or replaces
it, by other presumption. In the strict sense, only those findings or deci-
sions of the international tribunal that are based on judicial presump-
tions are refutable. However, they lose the ratio of their existence when
the international tribunal identifies the controversial matter which con-
stitutes the subject of judicial presumption. Then they drop by themselves
because they are deprived of their subject. But even then, it is the duty of
the international tribunal to refute, in the proper proceedings, its own
finding or decision based on a presumption.

12. So-called “prima facie jurisdiction” is, in fact, a good illustration

vided the only possible basis for seisin of the Court.

The right of a party to appear before the Court is the prerequisite of a
valid seisin. Seisin of the Court is not, nor can it be, an automatic con-
sequence of the act of a State taken with the objective of its seisure (such
an act would be more appropriate to term “seising”; see Sir Gerald Fitz-
maurice, The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice,
Vol. II, 1986, p. 440, footnote 2). If, arguendo, one would accept the
opposite view, it is unclear why the Court would not be seised also in the
case of acts taken by other persons — physical or juridical — who, pur-
suant to the Statute, are not entitled to appear before the Court.

An effective seisin of the Court is the condition short of which the
Court can hardly exercise the powers conferred upon it by the Statute.
These powers the Court must exercise

“whenever it has been regularly seised and whenever it has not been
shown, on some other ground, that it lacks jurisdiction or that the



claim is inadmissible” (Nottebohm, Preliminary Objection, Judg-
ment, I. C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122; emphasis added).

The Court, in fact, would not be able to deal with the claim if it were
not regularly seised. As the Court stated:

to verification. In principle, such presumptions as to locus standi of the
parties are verified by the Court ex officio or upon objection of the party.

In this (these) particular case(s) it should be pointed out that the pre-
liminary objections of all the respondent States regarding the jurisdiction
of the Court ratione personae are of a specific nature. Although mainly
named as objections to the jurisdiction ratione personae, they in fact chal-
lenged the validity of the seisin of the Court. Moreover, four of the
respondent States (namely, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands and
Italy) requested, in similar terms, the Court in their final submissions to
adjudge and declare that Yugoslavia “has no locus standi before the
Court” or that “the FRY is not entitled to appear before the Court”. In
other words, they called in question the very existence of the “case”
before the Court.


necessary procedural step enabling the Court to deal, inter alia, with the
validity of its seisin.

In contrast, valid seisin in regard to the question of locus standi means
that it is conclusively established by the Court that parties to a dispute
have fulfilled the necessary precondition to be entitled to appear before
the Court, i.e., that they have recognized in the proper way — by being a
party to the Statute of the Court or by the declaration pursuant to resolu-
tion 9 (1946) of the Security Council — the general jurisdiction of the
Court. It is that relevant point in time in which parties to a dispute
become parties to the dispute before the Court.

In that regard, the relationship between effective seisin and valid seisin
could be compared with the relationship between the so-called prima
facie jurisdiction and jurisdiction considered as conclusively established.

Accordingly, if the expression “effective seisin” or “regular seisin” is
used to denote validity of the seisin of the Court, it should be understood
as relating to the formal aspect of its validity only, not to the substantive
one.

(d) Obiter dictum containing elements or indications of substantive
approach

17. In the Application for Revision case the Court, considering Gen-
eral Assembly resolution 55/12 of 1 November 2000, points out, inter
alia, that it

“cannot have changed retroactively the sui generis position which
the FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United Nations over the period
1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court
and the Genocide Convention. Furthermore, the letter of the Legal
Counsel of the United Nations dated 8 December 2000 cannot have
affected the FRY’s position in relation to treaties.” (Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 71.)

It is easy to go along with the findings that, as a rule, General Assembly
resolutions, including the resolution in question, do not have retroactive
effect. But this finding of the Court can hardly be said to be very useful.
Because of the object of the exclusion of retroactive effect of General
Assembly resolution 55/12 in the aforementioned obiter — ie. a “sui
generis position which the FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United
Nations over the period 1992 to 2000 . . .” — which is obviously unclear
and vague. In the quoted formulation the phrase “sui generis” is linked
to the substantive “position” which, in this particular context, has a
highly unclear and technical meaning. Has it been used as a synonym or
a substitute for the word “membership” or the term “membership rights
and obligations” or, to express, for that matter, the factual relationship
between the Applicant and the Organization? If it has the meaning of
“sui generis” membership, it is difficult to fathom which elements of



membership from the abstract point of view, or which concrete elements

reasoning. More specifically, it is unclear what is actually the legal basis,
in the light of the controversy regarding the status of the Applicant in the
United Nations, for “the FRY’s right to appear before the Court”
(ibid. ). Is it based on its being a United Nations Member State which is
ipso facto a party to the Statute of the Court, or under the conditions
specified in Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court and Secu-
rity Council resolution 9 (1946)?

18. It is unclear how the obiter about the “sui generis position” of the
FRY vis-à-vis the United Nations came to find a place in the Court’s
Judgment in the Application for Revision case. In that case the Court was
faced with the issue whether the admission of the FRY to the United
Nations as such is a “new fact” in the sense of Article 61 of the Statute.
The Court itself stressed that:

“In reality, [the FRY] bases its Application for revision on the
legal consequences which it seeks to draw from facts subsequent to
the Judgment which it is asked to have revised. Those consequences,
even supposing them to be established, cannot be regarded as facts
within the meaning of Article 61. The FRY’s argument cannot
accordingly be upheld.” (Application for Revision of the Judgment of
11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections
( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
2003, p. 30, para. 69; emphasis added.)



What is striking is that the Court formulated its obiter after almost ten
years of the “avoiding position” approach to the issue, although the issue
of membership of the FRY in the United Nations was ab initio of fun-
damental importance for the jurisdiction of the Court in all disputes in
which the FRY is involved as a party before the Court. Having that in
mind, it could hardly be objected to by the Court that, throughout that
period, it found it necessary, in any of the proceedings unfolding before it
successively, to make interim determination upon the issue in explicit
terms for the purposes of the pending proceedings. However, the Court
failed to do so until the admission of the FRY to the United Nations,
when the matter was resolved definitely. That comes as a surprise in
itself.

19. The objective meaning of the insistence on the sui generis position
of Serbia and Montenegro vis-a-vis the United Nations in the period
from 1992 to 2000, as considered in paragraph 70 of the Judgment in the

United Nations. Or in terms of legal notions, it amounts to the creation
of a fictio leges.

20. The qualifications of the status of the Applicant in the United
Nations as “sui generis membership”, “de facto working status”, etc., are
deprived of legal substance in terms of the Charter. The Charter of the
United Nations does not recognize such forms of “membership” or “non-
membership” or a mixture thereof. These syntagmas constitute rather an
attempt — based on analogy with membership in terms of the Charter —
of a notional conceptualization of observer status of a non-Member
based on Article 2, paragraph 6, and Article 35, paragraph 2, of the
Charter, or of the status of non-State entities, such as national liberation
movements, or of observer status of regional organizations and groups of
States pursuant to Article 52, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United
Nations. In the qualitative sense, the meaning of the syntagmas such as
“sui generis membership” or “de facto working status” would mean, in
fact, reduced membership rights or the privileged position of some
non-Members.

Such a meaning can hardly be brought in accordance either with the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations which regulate member-
ship rights and obligations, or with the fundamental principle of sover-


The provisions of the Charter, as far as the relationship of the Organi-
zation vis-à-vis States is concerned, have been formulated in terms of the
dichotomy Member States/non-Member States. Tertium quid simply does
not exist. Chapter II of the United Nations Charter (“Membership”)
points out only the division into the original Members of the United



Nations and the subsequently admitted Members of the Organization, a
division which has no substantive meaning in terms of membership rights
and duties, but only that of historical record.

Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, setting out the prin-
ciples on which the Organization and its Members are based and shall
act, provides in paragraph 1 that “[t]he Organization is based on the prin-
ciple of the sovereign equality of all its Members”.

The principle contained in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter con-
stitutes ratione materiae a narrow application of the “basic legal concept
of State sovereignty in customary international law” (Military and Para-
military Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nicaragua v. United States
of America), Merits, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 111, para. 212;
hereinafter referred to as “Nicaragua”), with legal force equal to that of
the principle expressed in paragraph 2 of the same Article determined by
the Court as being “not only a principle of customary international law
but also a fundamental or cardinal principle of such law” (ibid., p. 100,
para. 190).

The principle of the sovereign equality of States as a universal principle
belonging to corpus juris cogentis operates with the United Nations
Charter on two levels:

(i) in the relationship between the Member States, with the exception of
the permanent members of the Security Council, as the principle of
equal membership rights and obligations, and

(ii) in the relationship between non-Member States and the Organiza-
tion, as the principle of equal rights and obligations non-Members
before the appropriate organs of the Organization as stipulated by
Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Charter.

In other words, the peremptory nature of the principle of sovereign
equality of States would not suffer a reduction in the corpus of rights and
obligations of an individual Member in relation to the corpus of rights
and obligations of a Member State as such on the basis of the Charter;
nor indeed would it entail enlarged rights and obligations of an indi-
vidual non-Member State over and above the extent of the rights and
obligations of non-Member States envisaged by the Charter.

The fact that the exercise of certain membership rights by a Member
State may be suspended on the basis of Article 5 of the Charter is another
matter. The suspension of membership rights and privileges on the basis
of Article 5 does not encroach upon the principle of equal membership
rights and privileges in view of the fact that it leaves unaffected both the
legal basis, and the membership rights and privileges, restricting only the
exercise of the membership rights and privileges until the removal of sus-
pension. However, the suspension of membership rights may, in special
circumstances, lead to a violation of the fundamental principle of equal-
ity of Member States in the proceedings before the Court (for instance, if
a suspended Member is precluded from taking part in the work of organs
of the Organization, or in the procedures established, whose findings or


statements serve as evidence in the proceedings before the Court).

The disappearance of a Member State as a subject of international law
leads ipso facto to the cessation of membership in the Organization of the
United Nations. Since membership rights and obligations are a substan-
tive effect of membership in the Organization, there exists an equal sign
between the disappearance of a State and the cessation of all its member-
ship rights and obligations. (An exception to this are the rights and obli-

rights and obligations.)

21. The proper judicial presumption has been applied by the Court in
the proceedings for the indication of provisional measures.

Namely, the finding of the Court that “the declarations made by the
Parties under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute do not constitute a
basis on which the jurisdiction” was grounded in the limitation ratione
temporis contained in Yugoslavia’s declaration recognizing the compul-
sory jurisdiction of the Court (Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia
v. Belgium), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999, 1.C.J. Reports
1999 (I), p. 135, para. 30). Consequently, the Court did not call in ques-
tion the validity of Yugoslavia’s declaration recognizing the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 2, of the
Statute, as such, but the temporal modality of its application in the
light of the reciprocity condition.

It appears that Judge Kooijmans was right in noting that:

“How can the Court say that there is no need to consider the ques-

the Respondent, cannot constitute a basis of jurisdiction? This con-
clusion surely is based on the presumption of the validity of Yugosla-
via’s declaration, at least for the present stage of the proceedings. If
such a presumption does not exist, the Court should at least have
said that it accepts that validity purely arguendo since, even if it had
been valid, it would not have had the capability to confer jurisdic-
tion on the Court in view of the limitation ratione temporis in the
Applicant’s declaration.” (Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia
v. Belgium), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999, L.C.J.
Reports 1999 (1), p. 177, para. 16, separate opinion of Judge Kooij-
mans; emphasis added.)

Reciprocity has nothing to do with the validity of a declaration as a juris-
dictional instrument, having in mind that it is limited in its effect to the
temporal scope of the obligation covered by the declaration. It is capable
of producing effect only limiting jurisdiction to the common ground



accepted by both parties, as stated by the Court in the Interhandel

“Reciprocity enables the State which has made the wider accept-
ance of the jurisdiction of the Court to rely upon the reservations to
the acceptance laid down by the other Party. There the effect of reci-
procity ends.” (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, LC.J. Reports
1959, p. 23; emphasis added.)

Having in mind the provisions of Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute
of the Court, and considering that Yugoslavia did not accept the jurisdic-
tion of the Court on the basis of Security Council resolution 9 (1946), it
transpires that the presumption of the validity of Yugoslavia’s declara-
tion only ratione materiae is a narrowed presumption of the membership
of Yugoslavia in the United Nations.

22. The Court furthermore resorted to the presumption of the legal
identity and continuity of the FRY when referring to the Genocide Con-
vention, and found that it lacks jurisdiction due to the fact that genocidal
intent on the part of the respondent States has not been proved.

In other words, the Court found that, in casu, there exists, at least,
prima facie jurisdiction ratione personae — on the basis of the con-
tractual nexus between the Applicant and the Respondent in the frame-
work of the Genocide Convention — and the lack of jurisdiction ratione
materiae on the basis of the Convention was ascribed by the Court to
the fact that genocidal intent, as an element of the crime of genocide,
has not been made probable.

It is obvious that the finding of the Court regarding the FRY as a
party to the Genocide Convention was based in the formal declaration of
the FRY of 22 April 1992, confirmed in an official Note of 27 April 1992
from the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General to the effect that:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continuing the State,
international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, shall strictly abide by all the commitments
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed inter-
nationally.” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The rules of interpretation of unilateral acts of States, accurately and
clearly set out in the Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) case as
“declarations . . . are to be read as a whole” and “interpreted as a unity”
(Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 454, para. 47;
p. 453, para. 44), indicate that unilateral acts “must be interpreted as
[they stand], having regard to the words actually used” (Anglo-Iranian



Oil Co., Preliminary Objection, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1952, p. 105),
with “certain emphasis on the intention of the . . . State” (Fisheries Juris-
diction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, 1.C.J.
Reports 1998, p. 454, para. 48).

It is difficult, on the basis of these rules of interpretation of unilateral
acts of States, or even on the basis of any of them taken individually, to
draw a conclusion that the intention of Yugoslavia was to “strictly abide
by all the commitments that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
assumed internationally” (Application of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( Bosnia and Herzegovina
v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II),
p. 610, para. 17) without reliance on, or on some other basis, except the
legal identity and continuity with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia (hereinafter referred to as the “SFRY”). (It is also disputable
whether the declaration of 27 April 1992 could be taken as a unilateral
act creating legal obligations at all. As the Court clearly stated in the
Nuclear Tests cases “[w]hen it is the intention of the State making the
declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that
intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking”
(Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1974,
p. 267, para. 43; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment,
IL C.J. Reports 1974, p. 472, para. 46). Thus all depends on the intention
of the State and it is up to the Court to “form its own view of the mean-
ing and scope intended by the author of a unilateral declaration which
may create a legal obligation” (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France),
Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 269, para. 48; Nuclear Tests (New
Zealand v. France), Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 474, para. 50). It
seems crystal clear from the text of the declaration that the intention of
Yugoslavia was not that it should become bound by obligations of the
former SFRY but to remain bound by “all obligations to international
organizations and institutions whose member it is”.)

Having in mind that, after the adoption of the Constitution of 27 April
1992, Yugoslavia did not express its consent to be bound by the Geno-
cide Convention in the way stipulated by Article XI of the Convention
and nor did it issue the notification of succession, it is obvious that the

SFRY in the domain of multilateral treaties.

23. It seems clear that the aforementioned Court’s presumptions were
not, in the circumstances surrounding the overall status of the FRY, of a
violent nature (violentia praesumptio). A contrario, the finding that the
solution adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/1 “is not free from
legal difficulties” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugo-



slavia ( Serbia and Montenegro) ), Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April
1993, LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 18) would be devoid of substance.

Having in mind the relevant circumstances that existed until the admis-
sion of Yugoslavia to membership in the United Nations, expressing rela-

leves) and probable presumptions (praesumptiones facti vel hominis
graves).

3. The Legal Consequences of the Admission of the FRY to the United
Nations

24. The FRY claimed legal identity and continuity with the SFRY
until the year 2000. Although, in my view, the FRY, in the light of the
relevant rules of international law — rules which are not quite clear and
crystallized, true — possessed the right to legal identity and continuity
with the SFRY, the continuity claim of the FRY, considered on the basis
of eminently political reasons, has not been accepted. This fact, when
speaking about the status of the FRY in the United Nations, is reflected
in the status which might be, very approximately, qualified as a kind of
irregular de facto suspension of membership rights on the model of
“vacant seat”. A model which, in relation to the FRY, was originally
applied in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE).

25. At the end of the year 2000 the FRY, in the relevant context, did
two things:

(i) renounced the continuity claim and accepted the status of the suc-
cessor State of the former SFRY ; and

(ii) proceeding from a qualitatively new legal basis — as the successor
State — submitted the application for admission to membership in
the United Nations.

26. The State, as a notion of international law, comprises two ele-
ments, i.e., possesses two faces:

(i) statehood in the sense of the relevant attributes such as a defined
territory, stable population and sovereign power;

(ii) legal personality, i.e., the status of a subject of international law
equipped with a corpus of rights and obligations. The legal person-
ality of the FRY, in the light of the relevant circumstances surround-
ing it, can be either of an inferential, derivative nature — based on
the legal identity and continuity with the SFRY — or of an inherent,
original nature — based on the status of a new State.

27. By submitting the application for admission to membership in the
United Nations, Yugoslavia not only renounced the claim to legal iden-



tity and continuity but claimed at the same time to be accepted as a new
State in the sense of some other, different legal personality — a successor
State versus partial continuation of the former SFRY — from the one
claimed until the year 2000. In fact, it accepted the claim qualified as the
claim of the international community made at the moment of the formal
proclamation of the FRY in April 1992. A claim which, however, the rele-
vant international organizations as well as States, acting in corpore as
members of the organizations or individually, did not implement in either
the formal or the substantive sense. Instead, they opted for solutions
based on pragmatic political considerations rather than on considera-
tions based on international law. Hence, a legal “Rashomon” about the
legal character of Yugoslavia was created — it is a new State or the old
State? — and about its status in the United Nations — is it a Member of
the United Nations or not?

28. The admission of Yugoslavia to membership of the United Nations
from 1 November 2000 also meant the acceptance of the claim of Yugo-
slavia to be accepted as a new State in the sense of a new international
personality different from its hybrid and controversial personality in the
period 1992-2000. The claim was accepted by way of a series of collateral
agreements in a simplified form, or a general collateral agreement in a
simplified form, between the FRY, on the one hand, and the Member
States of the United Nations and the world Organization itself, on the
other, embodied tacitly in the letter and spirit of General Assembly reso-

Counsel of the United Nations of 8 December 20007 and the list of Mem-
ber States with dates of their admission to the United Nations (United
Nations Press Release ORG/1317 updated 18 December 2000). The sub-
ject of the series of collateral agreements, or of the general collateral
agreement, is in fact recognition of the FRY as a new personality, a per-
sonality of the successor State of the former SFRY, and, in that capacity,

5 The letter of the Under-Secretary-General and Legal Counsel of the United Nations
of 8 December 2000 relating to one of the relevant legal consequences of the admission of
the FRY in the United Nations in the capacity of a successor State is basically of the
administrative nature. In that regard, it should be stressed that in its 1996 Judgment deal-
ing with the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s participation in the Genocide Conven-
tion, the Court noted that

“Bosnia and Herzegovina became a Member of the United Nations following the
decisions adopted on 22 May 1992 by the Security Council and the General Assem-
bly, bodies competent under the Charter. Article XI of the Genocide Convention
opens it to “any Member of the United Nations’; from the time of its admission to
the Organization, Bosnia and Herzegovina could thus become a party to the Conven-
tion.” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, LC.J. Reports 1996 (IT), p. 611, para. 19; emphasis added.)

recognized as a “new State” in the sense of its international legal person-
ality. In view of the fact that recognition of a State has ex definitione
retroactive effect, it necessarily follows that all pronouncements and
decisions taken relate to the FRY claiming continuity with the SFRY.
And, as far as the FRY after the year 2000 is concerned, its legal existence
as a new international legal personality started in November 2000 by its
admission to membership of the United Nations.

29. General Assembly resolution 55/12 is not an ordinary resolution.
Resolutions on the admission of a State to the United Nations, as distinct
from recommendation, have a character of decision. Namely,

“the functions and powers conferred by the Charter on the General
Assembly are not confined to discussion, consideration, the initia-
tion of studies and the making of recommendations; they are not
merely hortatory. Article 18 [of the Charter] deals with ‘decisions’ of
the General Assembly ‘on important questions’. These ‘decisions’
do indeed include certain recommendations, but others have disposi-
tive force and effect. Among these latter decisions, Article 18°
includes suspension of rights and privileges of membership, expul-
sion of Members . . . In connection with the suspension of rights and
privileges of membership and expulsion from membership [Articles 5
and 6], it is the Security Council which has only the power to
recommend and it is the General Assembly which decides and
whose decision determines status.” (Certain Expenses of the United
Nations ( Article 17, Paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion,
LC.J. Reports 1962, p. 163; emphasis added.)

Consequently, “[t]he decisions of the General Assembly would not be
reversed by the judgment of the Court” (Northern Cameroons, Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 33), for in the struc-
ture of the United Nations the Court does not possess “the ultimate
authority to interpret the Charter” (Certain Expenses of the United
Nations (Article 17, Paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion,
LC.J. Reports 1962, p. 168).

6 Article 18 of the Charter enumerates, inter alia, “the admission of new Members to
the United Nations”.

Nations entails the legal consequences. The admission of the FRY to the
United Nations as a Member from 1 November 2000 has two principal
consequences in the circumstances of the cases at hand:

(i) with respect to the admission of Yugoslavia as a Member as from
1 November 2000, it can be said, though somewhat descriptively,
that what is involved here is the admission “as a new Member”. This
expression indicates its temporal status in relation to the Members
admitted on an earlier date;

(ii) the admission of Yugoslavia as a Member as from 1 November 2000
qualified per se its status vis-a-vis the United Nations before that
date. It seems clear that, in the light of the decisions taken by the
competent organs of the United Nations, this status could not be a
membership status. A contrario, Yugoslavia could not have been
admitted as a Member as from 1 November 2000. Just as it is impos-
sible for things to be black and white at the same time, Yugoslavia
could not have been either a Member and a non-Member in the
period 1992-2000.

30. In the case at hand the Court was faced with several preliminary
objections of the Respondent, concerning both the special jurisdiction of
the Court in all three aspects (ratione personae, ratione materiae, ratione
temporis), the admissibility of the Applicant’s claims and the general
jurisdiction of the Court (locus standi of Serbia and Montenegro).

Having found that there is a lack of jurisdiction, the Court based
its decision, essentially, on the absence of locus standi of Serbia and
Montenegro. It appears that it has chosen the right path.

In the choice of the ground on which the Court is basing its lack of
jurisdiction, the Court enjoys a certain discretion — discretio legalis —
whose limits are determined by common sense and overriding legal con-
siderations emanating from the very nature of the judicial function. In
that regard, the Court has produced a general formula in the Certain
Norwegian Loans case, stating that “the Court is free to base its decision
on the ground which in its judgment is more direct and conclusive”
(Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 25).

The Court puts the formula in concrete terms depending on the cir-
cumstances of each particular case in order to determine the ground
which, objectively, has priority, both in terms of commonsense and in the
sense of legal considerations, in relation to the other grounds raised.

In concreto, it appears that locus standi of Serbia and Montenegro
deserves absolute priority in relation to the other grounds raised.




condition, in contrast to the other grounds raised representing the condi-
tions of the special jurisdiction of the Court in all the three aspects raised,
on which to base the jurisdiction of the Court in casu. As such it alone
is sufficient and capable, independently of other grounds raised, of pro-
ducing direct and conclusive effect on the jurisdiction of the Court. None
of the relevant aspects of the special jurisdiction of the Court (ratione
personae, ratione materiae, ratione temporis), as well as special jurisdic-
tion itself, possesses this capability. For, if Serbia and Montenegro does
not have locus standi, then any discourse about them is devoid of any
substance. It seems to be a proper application of the legal principle, being
also a principle of common sense, a majori ad minus.

Furthermore, it should not be taken as irrelevant that the choice made
by the Court corresponds to the purpose that the Respondent, as well
as the Applicant, attached to the issue of locus standi of Serbia and
Montenegro in their pleadings before the Court and final submissions
respectively.

31. In the light of these considerations, especially under sections 1 and
3 of this part, I am of the opinion that the formulation of the dispositif
explicitly linked to the absence of locus standi of Serbia and Monte-
negro would be more appropriate considering the circumstances of the
cases. The same effect could be produced by simply adding the adjective
“general” to the word “jurisdiction”. Not only because the question of
locus standi was sedes materiae of these proceedings, but because such a
formulation would naturally derive what the Court said dealing with par-
ticular basis of jurisdiction invoked (exempli causa, Judgment, paras. 45,


II. THE GROUNDS INVOKED BY THE RESPONDENTS FOR REJECTING THE
APPLICATION IN LIMINE LITIS

1. Implicit Discontinuance as a contradictio in adiecto

32. The arguments of the Respondents, specifically elaborated by
France, tended to move in the direction of termination of the proceedings
on the basis of something that might be termed “implicit discontinu-
ance”.

Namely, it was contended that “the Federal Government of Yugosla-
via could . . . have made the choice — the simple, reasonable choice — to
discontinue the proceedings. This was not the case, at least not expli-
citly.” (CR 2004/12, p. 6, paras. 3 and 4; emphasis added.) Commenting
on the Written Observations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
counsel for France finds that “[t]his looks very much like a discontinu-
ance that will not speak its name” (ibid., p. 8, para. 9 [translation by the
