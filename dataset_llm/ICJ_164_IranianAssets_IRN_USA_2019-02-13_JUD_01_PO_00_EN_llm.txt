                       Parties disagree on whether dispute is one “as to the interpretation or applica-
                    tion” of Treaty — Court observes that a particular dispute often arises in context
                    of broader disagreement between parties — Court must ascertain whether acts
                    complained of fall within provisions of Treaty and whether, as a consequence, dis-
                    pute is one which the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to entertain.

                    United States to block Iranian assets pursuant to Executive Order 13599.

                       Question whether blocking measures fall outside scope of Treaty by virtue of
                    Article XX (1) (c), which states that Treaty shall not preclude measures regulating
                    production or traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, and Arti-

                   protect essential security interests — Court has previously observed that Treaty
                   contains no provision expressly excluding certain matters from its jurisdiction —
                   Court has previously considered that Article XX (1) (d) did not restrict jurisdic-
                   tion but was confined to affording a possible defence on the merits — No reason
                   for Court to depart from earlier findings — Same interpretation applies to Arti-

                       Second objection to jurisdiction : Iran’s claims concerning sovereign immunities.
                   
                     Question whether claims predicated on purported failure to accord sovereign
                   immunity are outside Court’s jurisdiction — Court examines provisions of the
                   Treaty on which Iran relies to ascertain whether question of sovereign immunities
                   can be considered as falling within scope of Treaty.

                      Article IV (2), which guarantees protection and security to property of nation-
                   als and companies of either State in no case less than that required by international
                   law — Meaning of phrase “required by international law” — Viewed in light of
                   object and purpose of Treaty, the “international law” in question is that which
                   defines minimum standard of protection for property belonging to “nationals” and
                   “companies” of one Party engaging in economic activities within territory of the
                   other — Context of Article IV indicates that purpose of this provision is to guar-
                   antee rights and protections of natural persons and legal entities engaged in com-
                   mercial activities — Provision does not incorporate customary rules on sovereign
                   immunities.

                      Article XI (4), which excludes from sovereign immunity publicly owned or con-
                   trolled enterprises of either Party engaging in commercial or industrial activities
                   within territory of other Party — Provision does not affect sovereign immunities
                   under customary international law by State entities when they engage in activities
                   jure imperii — Provision does not implicitly guarantee, through an a contrario
                   interpretation, sovereign immunity of public entities engaged in activities jure impe-
                   rii — Object and purpose of Treaty support this interpretation — Provision does
                   not incorporate sovereign immunities.


                      Article III (2), which guarantees freedom of access to courts of other State on
                   terms no less favourable than those applicable to nationals and companies of third
                   States — Not linked to sovereign immunities because breach of international law
                   on sovereign immunities would not be capable of having impact on compliance with
                   Article III (2) — Provision not seeking to guarantee substantive or procedural
                   rights that a company might intend to pursue before courts — Nothing in ordinary
                   meaning of provision, in its context and in light of object and purpose of the Treaty,
                   to suggest that it entails an obligation to uphold sovereign immunities.


                     Article IV (1), which concerns fair and equitable treatment of nationals and
                   companies of both Parties, and prohibits unreasonable or discriminatory mea-

                    sures — Similar reasoning as for Article IV (2) — Provision does not include an
                    obligation to respect sovereign immunities.

                       Article X (1), which provides for freedom of commerce and navigation — Court
                    has previously ruled that “commerce” in Article X (1) includes commercial
                    exchanges in general, not limited to acts of purchase or sale, and covers a wide
                    range of ancillary matters — Nevertheless, cannot cover matters having no or too
                    tenuous connection with commercial relations between Parties — Violation of sov-
                    ereign immunities to which certain State entities are said to be entitled in exercise
                    of activities jure imperii not capable of impeding freedom of commerce and thus
                    does not fall within scope of this provision.

                       Claims based on alleged violations of sovereign immunities do not fall within
                    scope of Treaty’s compromissory clause and Court lacks jurisdiction to consider
                    them — Second objection to jurisdiction upheld.

                      Third objection to jurisdiction : Iran’s claims alleging violations of Articles III,
                    IV and V of the Treaty in relation to Bank Markazi.

                       Rights and protections guaranteed by Articles III, IV and V to “companies” of
                    a Contracting Party — Definition of “company” in Article III (1) — Entity must
                    have its own legal personality, conferred on it by law of the State where it was cre-
                    ated — Definition makes no distinction between private and public enterprises —
                    Bank Markazi endowed with its own legal personality by Iran’s Monetary and
                    Banking Act — Fact that Bank Markazi wholly owned by Iran does not, in itself,
                    exclude it from category of “companies” within meaning of Treaty.

                       Definition of “company” in Article III (1) to be read in context and in light of
                    object and purpose of Treaty — Treaty is aimed at affording protections to com-
                    panies engaging in activities of a commercial nature — Question whether Bank
                    Markazi is a “company” to be determined by reference to nature of its activi-
                    ties — Entity carrying out exclusively sovereign activities cannot be characterized
                    as a “company” — Nothing to preclude a single entity from engaging in both com-
                    mercial and sovereign activities.

                       Question of nature of activities of Bank Markazi in the United States — Iran’s
                    Monetary and Banking Act not discussed in detail by Parties — Court does not
                    have before it all facts necessary to determine whether Bank Markazi’s activities
                    at relevant time would lead to its characterization as a “company” within meaning
                    of Treaty — Elements largely of factual nature and closely linked to merits —
                    Third objection to jurisdiction does not possess, in circumstances of the case, an
                    exclusively preliminary character.

                      Abuse of process — Initially characterized as “abuse of right” by

                    does not constitute new objection — Court should reject claim based on valid title
                    of jurisdiction on grounds of abuse of process only in exceptional circumstances —
                    No exceptional circumstances in the present case.

                       “Unclean hands” — Court notes that the United States has not argued that Iran
                    has violated Treaty — Without having to take a position on the “clean hands”
                    doctrine, even if it were shown that Applicant’s conduct was not beyond reproach,
                    this would not be sufficient per se to uphold “unclean hands” objection to admis-
                    sibility — Conclusion without prejudice to question whether United States’ allega-
                    tions could eventually provide a defence on merits.

                        Objections to admissibility rejected.

                    after “Iran”) filed in the Registry of the Court an Application instituting pro-
                    ceedings against the United States of America (hereinafter the “United States”)
                    with regard to a dispute concerning alleged violations by the United States of

                        5. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of Iranian nationality,
                    Iran proceeded to exercise the right conferred upon it by Article 31, paragraph 2,

                        7. By a letter dated 30 March 2017, the United States, invoking Article 49 of
                    the Statute and Articles 50 and 62 of the Rules, requested that the Court call
                    upon Iran to produce, or arrange for the United States to have access to, “cer-
                    tain documents relevant to the claims Iran ha[d] asserted against the

                    sions of the documents to which it had sought access (see paragraph 7 above),
                    and announced its intention to file these public versions with the Court, adding
                    that they would constitute publications “readily available” within the meaning
                    of Article 56, paragraph 4, of the Rules.

                             executive, legislative and judicial acts (as referred to above) at issue in
                             this case which are, to the extent determined by the Court, inconsistent

                         (e) That the USA (including the US courts) is obliged to respect the jurid-
                             ical status (including the separate legal personality), and to ensure free-
                             dom of access to the US courts, of all Iranian companies, including
                             State‑owned companies such as Bank Markazi, and that no steps based

                               (i) That by its acts, including the acts referred to above and in par-
                                   ticular its failure to recognise the separate juridical status (includ-

                                   including Bank Markazi, the United States has breached its obli-

                                   rights, and (b) failure to accord to such entities and their property
                                   the most constant protection and security that is in no case less
                                   than that required by international law, and (c) expropriation of
                                   the property of such entities, and its failure to accord to such enti-

                             international law cease to have effect ;

                         (e) That Iran and Iranian State-owned companies are entitled to immunity
                             from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts and in respect of enforcement
                             proceedings in the United States, and that such immunity must be
                             respected by the United States (including the U.S. courts), to the extent

                             any provision of the Treaty of Amity, that are predicated on the
                             United States’ purported failure to accord sovereign immunity from
                             jurisdiction and/or enforcement to the Government of Iran, Bank Mar-
                             kazi, or Iranian State-owned entities.

                    terrorism”, a designation which has been maintained ever since.
                       22. In 1996, the United States amended its Foreign Sovereign Immuni-

                    and 1610 (b) (2) of the FSIA). Plaintiffs then began to bring actions
                    against Iran before United States courts for damages arising from deaths
                    and injuries caused by acts allegedly supported, including financially, by

                    and Syria Human Rights Act, Section 502 of which, inter alia, made the
                    assets of Bank Markazi subject to execution in order to satisfy default

                         some other pacific means.”

                      30. The Court begins by noting that it is not contested that the Treaty
                    of Amity was in force between the Parties on the date of the filing of Iran’s

3 CIJ1158.indb 32                                                                                   21/10/19 10:25

                    have interfered with freedom of commerce between the territories of the
                    Parties to the Treaty, in breach of Article VII, paragraph 1, and Arti-
                    cle X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty.
                       34. The United States maintains that Iran is not seeking the settlement

                    tions.
                       35. In Iran’s view, the United States “mischaracterises” the dispute by
                    contending that it would encompass the whole of the Iran‑United States
                    relationship since 1979. In its oral arguments, however, Iran acknowl-

                       37. The Court will examine in turn the three preliminary objections to
                    jurisdiction raised by the United States.

                                                  A. First Objection to Jurisdiction

                    claims fall outside the scope of the Treaty by virtue of Article XX, para-
                    graph 1, subparagraphs (c) and (d), thereof.

                    paragraph (c), of the Treaty, which the United States notes was not
                    invoked in the Oil Platforms case, in order to hold that Executive
                    Order 13599 is excluded from the Court’s jurisdiction under Article XX,
                    paragraph 1, of the Treaty. It maintains that the Court should confine

                    ing any other objection under that article as a preliminary matter, with-
                    out any consideration of the merits. The United States thus argues that its
                    first objection is an objection upon which the Court should render a deci-
                    sion before any further proceedings on the merits, in accordance with

3 CIJ1158.indb 38                                                                                   21/10/19 10:25

                       45. The Court recalls that it previously had occasion to observe in its
                    Judgment on the preliminary objection in the case concerning Oil Plat-
                    forms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Preliminary
                    Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 811, para. 20) and more

                         vision of the Treaty of Amity, that are predicated on the United States’
                         purported failure to accord sovereign immunity from jurisdiction
                         and/or enforcement to the Government of Iran, Bank Markazi, or
                         Iranian State‑owned entities”.

                       49. In substance, the United States argues that it follows from the text

                    sions in the Treaty of Amity. Those in the first category refer to interna-
                    tional law in general or to the law of immunities in particular, and,
                    according to Iran, must be understood as incorporating into the Treaty,
                    at least to some degree, the obligation to respect the sovereign immunities

                    cle III, paragraph 2 ; Article IV, paragraph 1 ; and Article X, paragraph 1,
                    of the Treaty.
                       52. The Court will examine below each of the provisions on which Iran
                    relies, in order to ascertain whether it permits the question of sovereign

                    of the immunities enjoyed under customary international law by the Ira-
                    nian State and Iranian State‑owned entities, as it claims on the merits, it
                    follows that the “[p]roperty of nationals and companies of either High
                    Contracting Party” did not “receive the most constant protection and

                    text of Article IV, paragraph 2.
                       55. The United States disputes this interpretation. In its view, the
                    “require[ments of] international law” referred to in Article IV, para-
                    graph 2, concern the minimum standard of treatment for the property of

                    tion of the phrase referring to the “require[ments of] international law” in
                    the provision quoted above is not consistent with the object and purpose
                    of the Treaty of Amity. As stated in the Treaty’s preamble, the Parties
                    intended to “encourag[e] mutually beneficial trade and investments and

                    Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I), pp. 321-322, para. 95). The
                    “international law” in question in this provision is that which defines the
                    minimum standard of protection for property belonging to the “nation-
                    als” and “companies” of one Party engaging in economic activities within

                    29 	               certain iranian assets (judgment)

                    2. Article XI, paragraph 4, of the Treaty
                      59. Article XI, paragraph 4, of the Treaty of Amity provides :

                         tion of judgment or other liability to which privately owned and con-
                         trolled enterprises are subject therein.”

                    seeks to guarantee the sovereign immunity of public entities when they
                    engage in activities jure imperii.


                      64. As the Court has stated previously,
                         “[a]n a contrario reading of a treaty provision . . . has been employed
                         by both the present Court (see, e.g., Territorial and Maritime Dispute



                    3. Article III, paragraph 2, of the Treaty
                      66. Article III, paragraph 2, of the Treaty of Amity provides :

                         applicable to nationals and companies of such other High Contract-

                    themselves of their immunity before United States courts.

                       68. The United States disputes this interpretation and contends that
                    the purpose of Article III, paragraph 2, is not to grant specific substantive



                                                        * *
                       69. Assuming for the purposes of the present discussion, as above (see


                       That is not the case. The provision at issue does not seek to guarantee
                    the substantive or even the procedural rights that a company of one Con-
                    tracting Party might intend to pursue before the courts or authorities of

                    must be allowed “upon terms no less favorable” than those applicable to
                    the nationals and companies of the Party itself “or of any third country”.
                    There is nothing in the language of Article III, paragraph 2, in its ordi-
                    nary meaning, in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the

                    the obligation to accord “fair and equitable treatment” and to refrain
                    from any “unreasonable or discriminatory measures” within the meaning
                    of Article IV, paragraph 1. In Iran’s view, the Court therefore has juris-
                    diction to ascertain whether the international law on immunities has been

                    private or professional activities, of a commercial nature, within the terri-
                    tory of the other Party. It does not concern entities engaged in sovereign
                    activities.




3 CIJ1158.indb 56                                                                                   21/10/19 10:25


                                                          * *
                        78. The Court recalls that in its Judgment on the preliminary objection
                     in the case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.


                                                           *
                       80. The Court concludes from all of the foregoing that none of the pro-
                    visions the violation of which Iran alleges, and which, according to the




3 CIJ1158.indb 58                                                                                       21/10/19 10:25

                    the United States, a central bank with functions of an exclusively sover-
                    eign nature falls outside the scope of Articles III, IV and V of the Treaty.
                    Such is the case, according to the United States, for Bank Markazi. The
                    Respondent refers to the statutes of the bank laid down in Iran’s

                    jurisdiction to entertain the claims based on the alleged violation of those
                    provisions.

                      83. Iran contends, to the contrary, that Bank Markazi is a “company”

                    according to Iran, assuming that, as the United States claims, the Treaty
                    only protects companies in so far as they are engaging in private, com-
                    mercial or business activities, it would be necessary for the Court to deter-
                    mine to which of Bank Markazi’s activities the treatment complained of

                    of Iran or Bank Markazi”, the question before it is solely that of whether
                    Bank Markazi is a “company” within the meaning of the Treaty of Amity
                    and is thereby justified in claiming the rights and protections afforded to
                    “companies” by Articles III, IV and V. It is because Bank Markazi is

                    molestation without just cause and other than according to law (Art. IV,
                    para. 3) ; the right for enterprises established by “nationals” and “compa-
                    nies” of one Party within the territory of the other to conduct their activ-
                    ities on terms no less favourable than for other enterprises of whatever


                       86. All these provisions refer to “nationals” and “companies” of a
                    Contracting Party. The term “national” applies to natural persons, whose
                    status is not at issue in the difference between the Parties as regards the




3 CIJ1158.indb 64                                                                                  21/10/19 10:25

                    indeed it does not do so.
                       In the second place, the fact that Bank Markazi is wholly owned by the
                    Iranian State, and that the State exercises a power of direction and close
                    control over the bank’s activities — as pointed out by the United States

                       The Court therefore concludes that an entity carrying out exclusively
                    sovereign activities, linked to the sovereign functions of the State, cannot
                    be characterized as a “company” within the meaning of the Treaty and,
                    consequently, may not claim the benefit of the rights and protections pro-

                    Bank Markazi has always presented itself as a central bank in the tradi-
                    tional sense and not as a commercial enterprise.

                       95. The Court observes that the Monetary and Banking Act of 1960,

                       96. Under Article 79, paragraph 9, of the Rules of Court, when it is
                    called upon to rule on a preliminary objection, the Court must give its
                    decision “in the form of a judgment, by which it shall either uphold the
                    objection, reject it, or declare that the objection does not possess, in the

                    should it find the Application to be admissible.
                      Therefore, there is reason to conclude that the third objection to juris-
                    diction does not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an exclusively
                    preliminary character.

                    ­character.

                                                          *
                      99. Given that the Court has jurisdiction to entertain part of the claims

                    Guinea v. France) made it more appropriate to characterize the objection
                    it raised as one based on an abuse of process.
                       102. According to Iran, it is too late to raise this new objection. In sup-
                    port of its view, it invokes Article 79, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court,


                                                         * *
                        103. The Court begins by recalling that, in the case concerning Immu-
                    nities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France), it consid-




3 CIJ1158.indb 72                                                                                    21/10/19 10:25

                    the Treaty of Amity. It points out in particular that the fundamental con-
                    ditions underlying the Treaty of Amity no longer exist between the Par-
                    ties, notably the friendly, commercial and consular relations envisaged
                    therein. It adds that Iran’s attempt to found the Court’s jurisdiction on

                    question was whether the Treaty of Amity was in force, and noted that
                    since it was, it must apply.

                    ripe for the Court to acknowledge it and apply it. According to the
                    United States, the Court need not address the merits of this case to assess
                    the legal consequences of Iran’s conduct.
                       118. Iran, for its part, rejects the allegations of the United States that

                    has never recognized its applicability.
                       120. In Iran’s view, it is nevertheless clear that the “clean hands” doc-
                    trine cannot be applied at the preliminary objections phase and that it
                    cannot serve as a basis for the inadmissibility of a claim.

                       123. Such a conclusion is however without prejudice to the question
                    whether the allegations made by the United States, concerning notably
                    Iran’s alleged sponsoring and support of international terrorism and its
                    presumed actions in respect of nuclear non‑proliferation and arms traf-

                    Application raised by the United States must be rejected.
