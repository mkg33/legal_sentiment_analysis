On the other hand, I share the view of the Court when it
recognizes that, in the present case, the jurisdiction of the Court
depends upon the Declarations made by the Parties in accordance
with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute.

This view does not seem to me to conflict with the principle
that the problem of the Court’s jurisdiction is reduced to deter-
mining the extent of the obligations assumed by the Parties and
to verifying their conformity with the provisions of the Statute
which the Court is obliged to observe and respect for which it
must ensure.

What is said with regard to special agreements applies equally
to the conditions in which States formulate their jurisdictional
clauses. In the latter, as in the former, the consensus of the Parties



is not sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the Court. It is
further necessary to ascertain whether that consensus is compatible
with the provisions of the Statute and whether it can be applied
without the Court’s being obliged to depart from those provisions.

The French Government's Declaration accepting the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court contains the following reservation:

“This declaration does not apply to differences relating to matters
which are essentially within the national jurisdiction as understood
by the Government of the French Republic.”

The great defect of this reservation is that it does not conform
either to the spirit of the Statute of the Court or to the provisions
of paragraphs 2 and 6 of Article 36.

It is obvious that the purpose of paragraph 2 is to establish the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court between States which accede
to the optional clause. By the fact that France reserves her right
to determine herself the limit between her own national jurisdiction
and the jurisdiction of the Court, France renders void her main
undertaking, for the latter ceases to be compulsory if it is France
and not the Court that holds the power to determine the limit
between their respective jurisdictions.

The reservation conflicts also with paragraph 6 of Article 36,
which 1s in the following terms:


NORWEGIAN LOANS (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE GUERRERO) 69

“In the cvent of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction,
the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.”

This principle is common to all arbitral and judicial tribunals of
an international character.

The Court would perhaps be the only tribunal that would be
compelled to refuse to deal with a dispute submitted to it whenever
a State invoked the reservation in question to claim the right to
determine that limit.

Without going in detail into the questions raised by the French

These considerations are, in my view, sufficient to prove the
urgent necessity for a judicial decision on the validity of reserva-
tions which go beyond what is permitted bv Article 36 of the
Statute.

Although Article 36 has been construed as meaning that a
declaration of accession to the optional clause may contain reser-
vations, it is certain that it was never the intention of the authors
of the Statute that such reservations should serve to enable a
State to evade the undertakings involved in the declaration pro-
vided for by Article 36, paragraph 2, or unilaterally to arrogate
to itself rights which the Statute confers solely on the Court.

Such reservations must be regarded as devoid of all legal validity.
It has rightly been said already that it is not possible to establish a
svstem of law if each State reserves to itself the power to decide
itself what the law is.

The problem to be solved is, however, a simple one. It is, in
fact, the problem whether the unilateral will of one State or the
common will of the Parties before the Court can have priority over
the collective will expressed in an instrument as important as the
Statute of the Court.

What it will be found difficult to understand is what reason the
Court could have had for not dealing with the question when it was
seised of the Franco-Norwegian dispute, in the course of which the
Parties invoked the terms of their respective declarations of acces-
sion to the optional clause.

As regards the operative part of the Judgment, I shall confine
myself to saying that I cannot agree that the Court is without
jurisdiction when its lack of jurisdiction is founded on the terms
of a unilateral instrument which I consider to be contrary to the
spirit and to the letter of the Statute and which, in my view, is,
for that reason, null and void.
