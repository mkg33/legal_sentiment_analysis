   The balance achieved by the Court in 2002 has now been lost as a
result of the Judgment on the preliminary objections. Just as I was of the
opinion that the Court could have indicated certain provisional measures
in reliance on certain of the bases of jurisdiction invoked by the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), so I believe that, at this stage of
the proceedings, the Court could have established its jurisdiction and
addressed the merits of the case.
   2. Neither the general public nor specialist commentators will under-
stand how the Court could arrive at two opposing rulings in two cases
sharing the same characteristics. There can be no doubt whatsoever that
the DRC nourishes the same grievances against Uganda as it does
against Rwanda. For no apparent reason, Uganda’s counsel espoused
Rwanda’s cause :
    “the requests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo relating to
    activities or situations involving the Republic of Rwanda or its
    agents are inadmissible . . .” (Armed Activities on the Territory of
    the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Judg-
    ment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 186, para. 24).
  3. When delivering its Judgment on 19 December 2005 in the case
between the DRC and Uganda, the Court was at pains to note the com-
plexity of the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. It also
focused on the need to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the region’s
problems :



        “The Court is aware of the complex and tragic situation which has
     long prevailed in the Great Lakes region. There has been much suf-
     fering by the local population and destabilization of much of the
     region . . . The Court is aware, too, that the factional conflicts within
     the DRC require a comprehensive settlement to the problems of the
     region.” (I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 190, para. 26 ; emphasis added.)


   4. The Court’s ruling at the preliminary objections stage, resulting in
removal of the case from the List, means that no decision will be made
from an international law perspective on the Parties’ claims and no
closure reached in the minds of the various victims, who still await
redress.
   The ideal approach would have been to settle the entire litigation
between the DRC and two of its neighbours, Uganda and Rwanda, in
the present case, in order to work effectively towards the restoration and
consolidation of peace in the region 1.
   5. The Court, principal judicial organ of the United Nations, has
set limits to its action in the legal settlement of disputes between the
countries of the Great Lakes region :

        “[T]he task of the Court must be to respond, on the basis of inter-
     national law, to the particular legal dispute brought before it. As it
     interprets and applies the law, it will be mindful of the context, but
     its task cannot go beyond that.” (Armed Activities on the Territory
     of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Judg-
     ment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 190, para. 26.)

   6. In disputing the Court’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the
Application submitted by the DRC, the Republic of Rwanda raised two
preliminary objections 2. It was of the opinion that the bases of jurisdic-
tion cited by the DRC (Article 22 of the Convention on Racial Discrimi-
nation ; Article 29, paragraph 1, of the Convention on Discrimination
against Women ; Article IX of the Genocide Convention ; Article 75 of
the Constitution of the WHO ; Article XIV, paragraph 2, of the Unesco
Constitution ; Article 9 of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities ;
Article 30, paragraph 1, of the Convention against Torture ; Article 14,
paragraph 1, of the Montreal Convention ; peremptory norms (jus
cogens) in the area of human rights and forum prorogatum) could not


                    ARMED ACTIVITIES (DISS. OP. MAVUNGU)                           97

found the jurisdiction of the Court (see Judgment, para. 15).

   In any event, even assuming that one of the titles or rules of customary
international law were to be accepted by the Court, the DRC’s Applica-
tion would be “nevertheless inadmissible” (ibid.).
   7. Pursuant to Article 79 of its Rules, the Court suspended proceed-
ings on the merits of the case in order to examine these preliminary objec-
tions. Their examination could result in removal of the case from the List
in the event of the Court concluding that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear
the dispute submitted to it or that the Application was inadmissible
ratione materiae, ratione temporis or ratione loci 3.
   In the instant case, the Court confined itself to addressing the issue of
its jurisdiction. Not having accepted any of the grounds of jurisdiction
advanced by the DRC, the Court considered that it was unnecessary to
take matters any further by considering the Application’s admissibility.
   8. Certain final findings in the Judgment justify the present dissenting
opinion. As I pointed out in 2002, during the proceedings on provisional
measures, while it is true that not all the titles and rules of customary
international law advanced by the DRC were capable of establishing the
Court’s prima facie jurisdiction, there were, however, compromissory
clauses upon which the Court could have based itself for this purpose
(Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application : 2002)
(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Provisional Measures,
Order of 10 July 2002, I.C.J. Reports 2002, pp. 277 et seq.).

   9. In the present case, I am not convinced that the Court has analysed
in depth the compromissory clauses contained in the following interna-
tional treaties : the Constitution of the WHO, the Montreal Convention
and the Convention on Discrimination against Women. Furthermore,
the Republic of Rwanda remained deliberately vague as to whether it had
withdrawn its reservation to the Genocide Convention, in light both of
its own constitutional law and of the declaration of the Rwandan Justice
Minister at the sixty-first session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights in Geneva on 17 March 2005.

      1. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
  10. Article 75 of the WHO Constitution states :
        “Any question or dispute concerning the interpretation or applica-
     tion of this Constitution which is not settled by negotiation or by the
     Health Assembly shall be referred to the International Court of Jus-
     tice in conformity with the Statute of the Court, unless the parties

Dinh, Patrick Daillier, Alain Pellet, Droit international public, 6th ed., 1999.


                 ARMED ACTIVITIES (DISS. OP. MAVUNGU)                   98

    concerned agree on another mode of settlement.”

  11. The first precondition fixed by this compromissory clause is the
existence of “any question or dispute concerning the interpretation or
application” of the WHO Constitution.
  12. The Court ruled that
    “the DRC has not shown that there was a question concerning the
    interpretation or application of the WHO Constitution on which
    itself and Rwanda had opposing views, or that it had a dispute with
    that State in regard to this matter” (Judgment, para. 99).
   13. The Permanent Court of International Justice defined a dispute
as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or
of interests between two persons” (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions
(Greece v. United Kingdom), Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A,
No. 2, p. 11).
   In the event of a dispute between two or more States, the words “two
persons” should be read as “two or more States”.
   In a number of cases, the Court has had to clarify and amplify the
notion of a dispute. To establish the existence of a dispute, “[i]t must be
shown that the claim of one party was positively opposed by the other”
(South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa ; Liberia v. South Africa),
Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 328) ; more-
over, “[w]hether there exists an international dispute is a matter for
objective determination” (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria,
Hungary and Romania (First Phase), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports
1950, p. 74 ; East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1995, p. 100, para. 22 ; Questions of Interpretation and Application of the
1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 17, para. 22 ; Questions of Interpreta-
tion and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the
Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States
of America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998,
pp. 122-123, para. 21).
   14. In the present case, the question or dispute must concern the inter-
pretation or application of the WHO Constitution.
   15. Both the spirit and the letter of the WHO Constitution establish
overriding obligations towards the Organization. As I had previously
submitted,
    “any State which becomes a Member of the WHO has a duty not
    only to co-operate with the organization to assist in fulfilling the
    mission assigned to it, but also to act in order to provide the popula-
    tion with the best possible level of health. Any failure to uphold the
    right to health is contrary to the object and purpose of the WHO
    Constitution. It would be wrong to assert that this Constitution does


                    ARMED ACTIVITIES (DISS. OP. MAVUNGU)                           99

     not lay down any obligations for Member States.” (Armed Activities
     on the Territory of the Congo (New Application : 2002) (Demo-
     cratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Provisional Measures,
     Order of 10 July 2002, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 279, para. 28 seperate
     opinion of Judge Mavungu.)

   16. On repeated occasions, the DRC made various protests regarding
the deterioration of the state of the Congolese population’s health during
the armed conflict.
   In his speech to the fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Com-
mission on Human Rights on 30 March 2001, President Joseph Kabila
stated :
        “According to data provided by NGOs such as the International
     Rescue Committee and by agencies of the United Nations, around
     2,500,000 Congolese have lost their lives in the occupied territories,
     victims directly and indirectly of aggression . . .
        Countless numbers of killings have occurred among the peaceable
     Congolese civilian populations. Numerous barbarous and savage
     acts have taken place such as . . . rapes, the deliberate spreading of
     AIDS . . .” (Emphasis added.)
   The various White Papers, previously published by the DRC’s
Ministry of Human Rights, record numerous violations of human
rights, including health-related questions. Both Rwanda and Uganda
are cited in this respect. By way of example, paragraph 45 of the First
White Paper, distributed as a working document to the Security Council,
states the following :
        “Museveni and Kagame are committing acts which are beyond all
     understanding in the pursuit of their strategy of exterminating the
     Congolese civilian population in the occupied areas. For example,
     2,000 Ugandan soldiers suffering from acquired immunodeficiency
     syndrome (AIDS) or infected with the human immunodeficiency
     virus (HIV) were sent to the front in Orientale Province, their mis-
     sion to rape women and girls with the aim of spreading the disease.
     Need it be recalled that Uganda and Rwanda have the sorry distinc-
     tion of having Africa’s largest number of AIDS sufferers and HIV-
     infected persons . . .” [Translation by the United Nations Secre-
     tariat.]
   The Fourth White Paper also describes the deterioration in health con-
ditions in the occupied territories 4. This has been confirmed by several
humanitarian organizations (Oxfam, Save the Children, Christian Aid,

   4 See Fourth White Paper, Ministry of Human Rights, Kinshasa, February 2002, pp. 34

et seq.


                    ARMED ACTIVITIES (DISS. OP. MAVUNGU)                       100

etc.), the European Parliament (14 June 2002 resolution), the Special
Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the DRC 5, etc.
   17. Violations of human rights, including health-related questions,
have been the subject of exchanges between the Parties in regional and
international bodies (OAU, Security Council, General Assembly, Com-
mission on Human Rights, etc.).
   18. In protecting the inviolable core of human rights, the priority lies
less in specifying the conventional provisions breached than in denoun-
cing these serious attacks on human dignity in order to put an end to
them. It is surely unreasonable to blame the Applicant for having in
certain cases omitted in its protests in international forums to cite the
norms or conventional provisions that underpinned them.

  19. In view of the foregoing, a dispute between the two Parties as to
application of the WHO Constitution definitely existed. WHO Member
States commit themselves to
     “the attainment by all people to the highest possible level of health,
     to regarding the achievement of the highest achievable standard
     of health as a fundamental right of every person on the planet,
     a recognition of health as fundamental to peace, and of the duty
     of State co-operation to achieve this ideal . . .” (Legality of the
     Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports
     1996 (I), p. 146, dissenting opinion of Judge Weeramantry).

   20. The second precondition fixed by Article 75 of the WHO Constitu-
tion is the recourse to negotiations or the World Health Assembly prior
to seisin of the Court.
   21. Without supporting its argument, the Court finds :
     “even if the DRC had demonstrated the existence of a question or
     dispute falling within the scope of Article 75 of the WHO Constitu-
     tion, it has in any event not proved that the other preconditions for
     seisin of the Court established by that provision have been satisfied,
     namely that it attempted to settle the question or dispute by negotia-
     tion with Rwanda or that the World Health Assembly had been
     unable to settle it” (Judgment, para. 100).
“The Court concludes from the foregoing that Article 75 of the WHO
Constitution cannot serve to found its jurisdiction in the present case.”
(Judgement, para. 101.)
   22. The state of conflict prevailing between the two Parties was not
