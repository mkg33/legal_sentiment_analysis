One of these preliminary objections rejected by the 1962 Judgment
was the third preliminary objection which related to the nature of the
dispute brought before the Court by the Applicants, namely to the
question of the existence of their legal right or interest. This matter
again, at this stage of the proceedings, has been taken up by the Court
and examined, but from the viewpoint of the merits.

Here, attention must be drawn to the Court’s characterization of
the question of the Applicants’ legal interest, namely its statement
that ‘there was one matter that appertained to the merits of the case
but which had an antecedent character, namely the question of the
Applicants’ standing in the present phase of the proceedings ... the
question .. . of their legal right or interest regarding the subject-matter
of their claim, as set out in their final submissions”.

The result is that the Applicants’ claims are declared to be rejected
on the ground of the lack of any legal right or interest appertaining to
them in the subject-matter of the present claims and that the 1962
Judgment is substantively overruled concerning its decision on the third
preliminary objection.

Although we do not deny the power of the Court to re-examine
jurisdictional and other preliminary matters at any stage of proceedings
proprio motu, we consider that there are not sufficient reasons to overrule
on this point the 1962 Judgment and that the Court should proceed to
decide the questions of the “ultimate” merits which have arisen from
the Applicants’ final submissions.

We are again confronted with the question whether the Applicants
possess a legal right or interest in the proper discharge by the Respondent,
as the Mandatory, of the obligations incumbent upon it by virtue of
the “conduct clauses” in the mandate agreement.



A negative conclusion is derived either from the nature of the interest,
or from the capacity of the Applicants.

The Mandate, as is stated in more detail below, presents itself, eco-
nomically and sociologically, as an aggregate of several kinds of interest.

The personal structure of the mandates system is very complicated
and sui generis; besides the mandatory, the League and the inhabitants
of the territories, there are persons who are connected with the mandate
in some way, particularly those who collaborate in the establishment or
in the proper functioning of this system, such as the Principal Allied
and Associated Powers and the Members of the League.

The interests corresponding to the categories of persons mentioned
are multiple. Here, only the interest of Members of the League is in
question, since the question of the existence of a legal interest of the
Applicants as former Members of the League has now to be determined.

The interests which may be possessed by the member States of the
League in connection with the mandates system, are usually classified in
two categories. The first one is the so-called national interest which
includes both the interest of the member States as States and the interest
of their nationals (Article 5 of the Mandate). The second one is the
common or general interest, which the member States possess in the
proper performance by the mandatory of the mandate obligations.

Whether the adjudication clause, namely Article 7, paragraph 2, of
the Mandate can cover both kinds of interests, or only the first one,
namely national interest, is the question that has to be answered in
the present cases.

Here, we must recognize the fact that the above-mentioned two
kinds of interests are different from each other. The first category of
interest although related to. the Mandate, is of an individual nature
and each member State of the League may possess such an interest
regarding the mandated territory, incidentally, that is to say, for some
reason other than the Mandate itself. The second category of interest
emanates from the sphere of social or corporate law concerning the
function of the League in regard to the Mandate. The member States
of the League are in the position of constituting a personal element of
the League and its organs and, consequently, are interested in the
realization of the objectives of the mandates system and in the proper
administration of mandated territories. The interest which the member
States possess concerning the Mandate is, in its content, the same for
all Members of the League, and is therefore general and uniform in the
case of each member State, thereby differing from the first category

fact that it is of this nature does not prevent it from possessing the



nature of interest. There is no reason why an immaterial, intangible
interest, particularly one inspired by the lofty humanitarian idea of a
“sacred trust of civilization” cannot be called “interest”.

In short, the interest possessed by the member States of the League
as its Members is corporate and, at the same time, idealistic. However,
this does not prevent it from being “interest”.

The interest which the member States of the League possess regarding
the proper administration of the mandated territory by the Mandatory
is possessed by Members of the League individually, but it is vested
with a corporate character. Each Member of the League has this kind
of interest as a Member of the League, that is to say, in the capacity
of an organ of the League which is destined to carry out a function of
the League.

The question is, whether this kind of interest can be called “legal
interest”, and whether law recognizes it as such.

The historical development of law demonstrates the continual process
of the cultural enrichment of the legal order by taking into consideration
values or interests which had previously been excluded from the sphere
of law. In particular, the extension of the object of rights to cultural,
and therefore intangible, matters and the legalization of social justice
and of humanitarian ideas which cannot be separated from the gradual
realization of world peace, are worthy of our attention.

The fact that international law has long recognized that States may
have legal interests in matters which do not affect their financial, eco-
nomic, or other “material” or so-called “physical” or “tangible” interests
was exhaustively pointed out by Judge Jessup in his separate opinion
in the South West Africa cases, 1962 Judgment (I.C.J. Reports 1962,
pp. 425-428). As outstanding examples of the recognition of the legal
interests of States in general humanitarian causes, the international efforts
to suppress the slave trade, the minorities treaties, the Genocide Con-
vention and the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation
are cited.

We consider that in these treaties and organizations common and
humanitarian interests are incorporated. By being given organizational
form, these interests take the nature of ‘legal interest” and require
to be protected by specific procedural means.

The mandates system which was created under the League, presents
itself as nothing other than an historical manifestation of the trend
of thought which contributed to establish the above-mentioned treaties
and organizations. The mandates system as a whole, by incorporating
humanitarian and other interests, can be said to be a “legal interest”.

However, what is in question is not whether the Mandate is a legal
interest or not. What we are considering is not legal interest in itself,



but its relationship with persons who possess it, that is to say, the
question of the existence of a legal interest as a condition on which the
Applicants, as Members of the League, possess the right to have recourse
to the International Court.

Each member of a human society—whether domestic or international
—is interested in the realization of social justice and humanitarian ideas.
The State which belongs as a member to an international organization
incorporating such ideas must necessarily be interested. So far as the
interest in this case affects the rights and obligations of a State, it may
be called a legal interest. The State may become the subject or holder
of a legal interest regarding social justice and humanitarian matters,
but this interest includes its profound concern with the attitude of
other States, particularly member States belonging to the same treaty or
organization. In short, each State may possess a legal interest in the
observance of the obligations by other States.

In the mechanism of the above-mentioned treaties and organizations,
the procedural means to guarantee the observance are provided, although
not in a uniform way, taking into consideration the difference in the
objective and structure of each treaty and organization.

The question is whether under Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate,
the Applicants possess a right to have recourse to the Court by reason
of a violation by the Respondent of certain conduct clauses provided by
the Mandate, namely whether the Applicants have a legal interest in
invoking the Court’s jurisdiction concerning the obligations imposed
on the Respondent by the conduct clauses.

One of the arguments in denial of the Applicants’ legal interest in
the Respondent’s observance of the conduct clauses is that the Applicants
do not suffer any injuries from non-observance of the conduct clauses.
The Applicants, however, may not suffer any injuries in the sense that
their own State interests or the interests of their nationals are injured.
The injuries need not be physical and material, but may be psychological
and immaterial, and this latter kind of injuries may exist for the Appli-
cants in the case of non-observance by the Respondent of the conduct
clauses.

The supreme objectives of the mandates system, namely the promotion
of the well-being and social progress of the inhabitants of the Territory
mentioned in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate, in spite of their
highly abstract nature, cannot be denied the nature of a legal interest
in which all Members of the League participate.

As we have seen above, there exist two categories of legal relationships

in the mandates system from the viewpoint of the Members of the
League: the one is its individual side and the other is its corporate side.

Now, the existence of the corporate side in regard to the Mandate
is in question.

One ground for denying to a Member of the League the right to
have recourse to the International Court of Justice under Article 7,
paragraph 2, of the Mandate, seems to be that this right, being of a
public nature, cannot be exercised by a Member of the League. Only
the League could possess such right and exercise it notwithstanding
the fact that States only may become parties in cases before the Court.
If a Member of the League exercises a right which should belong to the
League as a whole, this would be nothing but an act ultra vires.

Here we must consider whether it is not legally impossible that in
the case of an organization an individual member of it can act as an
organ of the whole.

In the field of corporation law, such phenomena are highly developed.
In some countries we find the institution of a representative suit by
a shareholder against the administration. Each shareholder not only
possesses individual rights in respect of dividends and rights to participate
in the assembly and to vote, but can behave independently of the ad-
ministration and of the assembly in bringing a law suit on behalf of
the corporation. In this case, in the position of a shareholder, the
corporate and individual elements are intermingled. As a result, even
if a Member of the League has a right to have recourse to the Inter-
national Court by virtue of Article 7, paragraph 2, on the ground of
non-compliance by the Mandatory with the obligations of Article 2,
paragraph 2, of the Mandate, it cannot be considered as unjuristic.

There are two main reasonings upon which the Court’s denial of
the Applicants’ legal right now appears to be based. The one is the
juridical character and structure of the institution, the League of Nations,
within the framework of which the mandates system is both created
and enshrined. The League functions “through the instrumentality of
an Assembly and a Council” and “no role was reserved either by the

LE

Covenant or the mandate instruments to individual members ...”.

We cannot deny that the League and the mandates system possess
such structure that the member States as individuals are fundamentally
excluded from participation in the functioning of the League and the
mandates system and that rights cannot be derived from the mere fact
of membership of the organization in itself. The question remains as



to whether the corporate structure of the League excludes the possibility

The other reasoning is, that, in the Court’s opinion, the Applicants
do not possess a legal right directly or by a clearly necessary implication,
through a substantive and not merely adjectival provision of the Mandate
in the same way as they possess it by virtue of Article 5 of the Mandate
which is concerned with the so-called “national rights” of the Member
States. But in this case, whether a substantive right is conferred on
member States by that provision or not, is highly doubtful.

It seems that by the effect of this provision the member States and
their nationals are simply accorded an interest as beneficiaries in con-
nection with the proper administration of the Mandate. This fact is
clear from the first half of the said Article which is concerned with the
guarantee of freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms
of worship—matters which concern the inhabitants in general, and not
only the member States.

Although Article 5 of the Mandate is partly concerned with the
national interest of the member States of the League, the nature of this
provision is not fundamentally different from that of the rest of the
provisions of the Mandate. It possesses the same nature as the “conduct”
clause. It does not confer upon the member States any substantive right.
They receive only a certain benefit as a “reflective” effect of the mandate
instrument, but not any right as an effect of an independent juridical
act which does not exist.

Incidentally, Article 5 of the Mandate mentions “all missionaries,
nationals of any State Member of the League of Nations”. But this
phrase does not mean that any member State possesses a right concerning
its missionaries and nationals, because it is used simply to identify the
missionaries and nationals. Whether the member States of the League
possess the right of diplomatic protection is another matter.

Accordingly, the distinction between the “conduct” clause and the
“national” clause is not an essential one. The latter must be considered
as an integral part of the Mandatory’s obligations which are derived
from the objectives of the mandates system, namely the promotion of
material and moral well-being and social progress. Whether some of
the obligations are related to the interest of some of the member States
of the League or not, is quite immaterial to the nature of Article 5 of
the Mandate. -

Therefore the classification of the mandate provisions into two
categories, namely the conduct clause and the national clause is of
secondary importance.

As to the argument that the substantive right of the Applicants must



be found, not in the jurisdictional, adjectival provision but in the sub-
stantive provision, we feel we should point out that in the Mandate the
substantive and procedural elements are inseparably intermingled and
that Article 7, paragraph 2, can confer substantive rights on the indi-
vidual member States of the League. This conclusion must be justified,
if we approve the above-mentioned viewpoint that Article 5 of the
Mandate does not confer upon the member States of the League any
substantive right. The source of their right cannot be sought elsewhere
than in Article 7, paragraph 2, in connection with other provisions of
the Mandate.

In this connection, we cannot overlook the dissenting opinions of
Judges de Bustamante and Oda appended to the Judgment of the
Mavrommatis Concessions case. Both emphasize what they consider as
essential in the compromissory clause. Judge de Bustamante says:

“As the latter [the League of Nations] could not appear as a
party to a dispute concerning the application or interpretation of
the Mandate, having regard to the restrictive terms of Article 34
of the Court’s Statute, it is the Members of the League who have
been authorized, in their capacity as Members, to bring before the
Court questions regarding the interpretation or application of the
Mandate.” (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 81.)

“Whenever Great Britain as Mandatory performs in Palestine
under the Mandate acts of a general nature affecting the public
interest, the Members of the League—from which she holds the
Mandate—are entitled, provided that all other conditions are
fulfilled, to have recourse to the Permanent Court. On the other
hand, when Great Britain takes action affecting private interests
and in respect of individuals and private companies in her capacity
as the Administration of Palestine, there is no question of juridical
relations between the Mandatory and the Members of the League
from which she holds the Mandate, but of legal relations between
third parties who have nothing to do with the Mandate itself from
the standpoint of public law.” (Zbid., pp. 81-82.)

Next, Judge Oda, pursuing the same idea more clearly, says:

“Since the Mandate establishes a special legal relationship, it is
natural that the League of Nations, which issued the Mandate,
should have rights of supervision as regards the Mandatory. Under
the Mandate, in addition to the direct supervision of the Council
of the League of Nations (Articles 24 and 25) provision is made
for indirect supervision by the Court; but the latter may only be
exercised at the request of a Member of the League of Nations
(Article 26). It is therefore to be supposed that an application by
such a Member must be made exclusively with a view to the pro-
tection of general interests and that it is not admissible for a State



simply to substitute itself for a private person in order to assert
his private claims.” (Zbid., p. 86).

minority opinions on this matter and were recently criticized by Judge
Winiarski (dissenting opinion in South West Africa cases, I.C.J. Reports
1962, pp. 450, 451), we cannot fail to attach importance to the fact
that, shortly after the inception of the mandates system, such opinions,
even if they were minority, existed.

Another strong argument raised by Judges Sir Percy Spender and
Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice in the joint dissenting opinion to the 1962
Judgment (7.C.J. Reports 1962, pp. 552, 553), against the admissibility
of the Applicants’ claim is related to the character of interest which,
it is contended, does not allow a settlement to be achieved. The argu-
ments are related to the question of competence with regard to settlement.

The dispute within the meaning of Article 7, paragraph 2, must be
one which cannot be settled by negotiation.

Well, in the present cases, the dispute in which the interest is incorpo-
rated is of a humanitarian character which does not appear to be com-
patible with the possibility of settlement by negotiation. It will furnish
a strong reason to support the argument denying the admissibility of
the claim in the present cases, because the law suit is in some sense an
act of disposal of interest and, in this case, the dispute is mainly concerned
with fundamental human rights which are called inalienable.

The joint dissenting opinion (ibid., p. 551), denies the possibility of
settlement of the dispute by negotiation inter se—namely between the
Applicant and Respondent States. The reason seems to be based, on the
one hand on the nature of the dispute which does not relate to their
own State interests or those of their nationals, but belongs to the
“conduct of the Mandate’ type—the “sacred trust”; on the other hand,
on the incapability of any settlement negotiated between single States,


The inherent incapability of settlement of subject-matter such as
the sacred trust, to be settled by negotiation, however, does not exclude
the possibility of compromise concerning detailed policies and measures
in order to implement the fundamental principles of the Mandate.
Implementation is essentially a matter of degree and is therefore sus-
ceptible of compromise. Accordingly, we cannot consider that the
nature of a dispute which is concerned with the sacred trust is incom-
patible with settlement by negotiation.

The question of competence to settle by negotiation must be decided
from the point of view that the Applicants as Members of the League
individually and at the same time as its organ possess a legal interest
in the realization of the sacred trust and therefore competence to settle
the dispute by negotiation.

It may reasonably be feared that, if each individual Member of the
League possesses a right to institute proceedings against the Mandatory
by reason of non-compliance with the conduct clauses, repetitious
suits against the Mandatory would arise, procedural chaos would
prevail and the legal situation of the Mandatory would be highly pre-
carious.

In circumstances in which the binding power, erga omnes effect,
of a decision of this category is lacking, one is obliged to rely solely
upon the possibility of intervention (Articles 62, 63 of the Statute),
the wisdom of the Court and the common-sense of those concerned
until legislative arrangement and adjustment will be made to attain
uniformity of decision. These possible abnormalities, arising from the
defect of the machinery, however, should not be a reason for denying
a right to have recourse to the International Court by reason of non-
compliance by the Mandatory of the conduct clauses of the Mandate.

As we have seen above, the interests involved in the mandates system
are multiple. The Applicants in their capacity as Members of the
League possess a legal interest in compliance by the Respondent with
the obligations imposed by the conduct clauses of the Mandate. The
Applicants, on the other side, can have individual interests which
are classified in two categories: on the one hand, State interests and on
the other, the interests of their own nationals. Although these interests
may exist in connection with the administration of the Mandate, they
are only incidental to the mandates system. Far more important are
the general interests which are inherent in the Mandate itself and which
cannot be ignored in the interpretation of the compromissory clause
in the Mandate.

As we have seen above, it is argued that the supervision of the Mandate
belongs to the Council of the League and to this body only, not to
individual Members of the League; therefore they possess no right to
invoke the Court’s jurisdiction in matters concerning the general ad-
ministration of the Mandate, nor does the Court possess power to
adjudicate on such matters.

. However, the existence of the Council as a supervisory organ of
the Mandate cannot be considered as contradictory to the existence of
the Court as an organ of judicial protection of the Mandate. The
former, being in charge of the policies and administration of the Man-
datory and the latter, being in charge of the legal aspects of the Mandate,
they cannot be substituted the one for the other and their activities
need not necessarily overlap or contradict one another. They belong
to different planes. The one cannot be regarded as exercising appellate
jurisdiction over the other.

As long as the compromissory clause is adopted in a mandate agree-
ment and the scope and limit of its application are by reason of the
vagueness of the terms of the provision not clear, it is quite natural



that we should seek the just criterion of interpretation in the principle
of the Mandate, that the well-being and development of peoples not
yet able to stand by themselves form a sacred trust of civilization. This
principle presents itself as a criterion of interpretation of the provisions
of the Mandate including Article 7, paragraph 2. Such is the conclusion
of a teleological interpretation of Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate.

whatever”. The dispute may relate to the interpretation or the application
of the “provisions” of the Mandate. There is no reason for concluding
that this dispute should be limited to the kinds of dispute involving
the individual interests of the member States of the League and that
the provisions should mean only those which protect such kinds of

interest.

The above-mentioned conclusion is precisely in conformity with a
literal interpretation of Article 7, paragraph 2, namely the ‘natural
and ordinary meaning” of the terms of its text.

In sum, Article 7, paragraph 2, as the means of judicial protection
of the Mandate cannot be interpreted in such a way that it ignores the
most fundamental and essential obligations of the Mandatory to carry
out the “sacred trust” and excludes the ‘‘conduct clauses” from the
“provisions” to which Article 7, paragraph 2, shall be applied. We must
not lose sight of what is essential in the face of what is incidental.

For the above-mentioned reasons, we consider that the Applicants
are entitled to have recourse to the International Court of Justice,
because our view is that the present dispute, involving a legal interest
of the Applicants, falls within the scope and limit of the application
of Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate. Accordingly, we are unable
to concur in the Court’s opinion that the Applicants’ claims are, on
the ground of the lack of any legal right or interest, to be rejected.
