The reason why I consider that the Court is without juris-
diction in this case is different from that given in the judgment.
I base myself, not on the second ground of the first Objection
put forward by the Government of the Kingdom of Norway
but on the first ground of that Objection. State loans, as
being acts of sovereignty, are governed by municipal law.
