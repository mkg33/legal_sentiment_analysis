The one case which, in the view of the Swedish authorities, arose
in the present instance was that mentioned in paragraph (a). There
was no question of the infant’s being ill-treated or exposed to serious
negligence, the question was of a danger regarding her physical or
moral health. Article 22 (a) requires that this danger should be
one threatening her in the family home. The Swedish authorities

However, the Court had to decide whether at the moment of the
institution of the protective upbringing and of its maintenance,
these measures were compatible with the Convention, and, if not,
whether they should be ended. Therefore, in my view, one must
adjudicate on the facts advanced by the Parties which, however
incomplete they may be, show that the protective upbringing has
only been instituted and maintained for reasons connected with the
moral or mental health of the infant. It is the right of the Parties
in the case to ask the Court to give its Judgment on these facts
alone.

3. Although in the Judgment of the Court the measure of pro-
tective upbringing is considered as outside the scope of the Conven-
tion—an opinion with which I cannot agree—the Court accepts
that, in particular in the decision of the Supreme Administrative
Court of October 5th, 1954, the capacity of the Dutch female
guardian to concern herself with the person of the infant was
recognized. This is the starting point for the ensuing considerations
in which the Court holds that the protective upbringing cannot be
regarded as a rival guardianship to the guardianship instituted in
the Netherlands.

None the less, I should have preferred a categorical declaration in
which the Court held that the guardianship of the parental guard-
jan and that of Mme Postema or at least the latter, constituted
guardianship within the meaning of the Convention. The Court
would thereby have rejected the Swedish Government’s contention

For the interpretation of the Convention in this sense, I attach
great importance to the indications to be found in the Acts of the
Hague Conferences of 1803, 1894 and 1900 which, in this respect,
are more important than the representatives of the two Govern-
ments have indicated. In particular, it appears that the applica-
tion of the national law of the infant, as regards the reasons for
guardianship, mentioned in Article 5, is equally valid for Article 1.
For example, if the death of one of the parents deprives the infant
of the care of both its parents, there is then a ‘‘guardianship” in
an ‘’autonomous’’ sense acceptable for other countries.

national law is to be applied in the contracting States as regards
everything that concerns the exercise of guardianship until that is
finally terminated. In the Acts of the Second Hague Conference of
1894 (p. 112, Report of the Fourth Commission), mention is made
of the difficulties which the application of a foreign law involves,
and the Commission therefore proposed to regulate the matter in
such a way that the competence of the courts and of the authorities
and the law applicable should coincide. The Commission clarified
its point of view by stating that the difficulties were already most
embarrassing and that ‘‘those involved in the organization of a
complete juridical situation, in all its phases and with all its com-
plications, would be even more so”. This same expression ‘““guard-
ianship in all its phases” recurs in the commentary on Article I,
also on page II2. Apparently, the aim was to regulate the whole
organization of guardianship, in conformity with the Preamble to

late conflicts of laws. Above all, what is important is to determine
the scope of the provisions comprised in such a conflict.

Now, the scope of the Convention is fairly wide. Guardianship
formed part of a whole system of international conventions which
was in contemplation at The Hague, including the guardianship of
adults, which became the Convention concerning interdiction and
similar measures of protection—as, in the 1803 programme, a
convention was planned on puissance paternelle as well.

protection of the person and interests of a foreign infant to be
taken by the local authorities.

As regards the extrinsic scope of guardianship, this institution
could in no way and nowhere exist or function without intervention
and permanent supervision by the courts or the administrative
authorities, or both. Literally, #ufela means protection. The
institution of guardianship does not fall exclusively within the
domain of private law. From the outset, the public interest was
involved and it is so at present in an even larger measure, in all the
contracting States.

The present regulation of Dutch guardianship includes the
removal or discharge of a guardian if he neglects his obligations
(Art. 410, para. 1, No. 2, Burgerlijk Wetboek)—the right of the
Department of the Public Prosecutor to entrust the infant to a
Guardianship Council (Voogdijraad, since 1955 Raad voor Kinder-
bescherming) in case of the removal of the guardian (Art. 421 a)—
the discharge of the guardian at the request of the Department of
the Public Prosecutor or the Guardianship Council (Art. 423 j°
374 a, B.W.)—supervision by the deputy-guardian— various rights
of the Guardianship Council and the Children’s Judge—guardian-
ship exercised by bodies, as ordered by the Court (Art. 396). There
is always a competent court in the Netherlands, by virtue of the
requirement that the deputy-guardian should reside within the
territory, as well as a Guardianship Council dealing with infants
residing abroad (Art. 461 a).

Ever since the entry into force of the codification of 1838, the
surviving father or mother has had the guardianship; there has
been a deputy-guardian (except in the irrelevant case of Art. 421
B.W.); the court has had the right to remove the guardian; the
guardian has had the duty of taking care of the person of the infant
and, if he had serious misgivings as to the latter’s conduct, the
guardian could apply to the court for the detention of the infant
(Arts. 422, 423, 437, 441, 442, B.W., French translation by G. Tri-
pels, 1886). Thus there was already a system of protective rules
which have gradually been increased and improved.

Sweden, like other contracting States, was in a position to
know of this system of protection, as also of the draft law of Febru-

Convention governs the organization of guardianship in its totality,
with the aim of protecting children. In principle, it refers to the
national law, but this law gives way to the law of the place of
residence, as far as may be necessary. As an exception, if guardian-
ship is not or cannot be set up in accordance with Articles I and 2,

100 -

CONV. OF 1902 (Diss. OPIN. OF JUDGE OFFERHAUS) 152

it is instituted and administered in conformity with the law of
the place of habitual residence of the infant abroad (Art. 3). As an
exception also, Article 7 provides that pending the institution of a
guardianship, and in all cases of urgency, measures required for the
protection of the person and interests of the infant may be taken by
the local authorities.

The Swedish authorities might have considered the application of
Article 7 as a measure of urgency. But in their decisions there is no
allusion to the 1902 Convention.

I do not share the view that in cases of urgency Article 7 only
concerns special or partial measures. Article 7 allows temporary
measures of urgency, even if they cover the whole intrinsic sphere
of guardianship.

As to the decisions of the Dutch courts, the applicability of
Article 7 has, in my opinion, been affirmed by the Judgment of the

As to the question whether the measure of protective upbringing
taken on May 5th, 1954, should, after the event, be described as
urgent in the sense of Article 7, I would reply in the affirmative.
If there could be any hesitation on this point, it would be for a
reason of quite another kind: if one admits that the Child Welfare
Board was aware of the foreign nationality of the child, it should
have applied Article 8 of the Convention and should then have
taken action on the basis of the obligations laid upon it by this
Convention.

the decision of the Government of the Province of Ostergôtland
of June 22nd, 1954, and to the decisions which followed, because
the nationality of the father and the appointment of the deputy-
guardian were then known. The Government of the Province
should have abstained from taking any such decisions and should
have left the child to the care of her guardian and the supervision

of the deputy-guardian. After the change of guardian, moreover,
it was only the child’s health which was regarded as a reason
for the decisions. Hence, the situation was thenceforward completely
governed by the national law. In the Swedish decisions there is to
be found no reproach or fear as regards the guardian Mme Postema,
except the fear that the child would remain under the influence of
the father. Nothing in these decisions justifies any urgent measure
for the moral health of the child.

6. The second and the more important conclusion that I draw
from a comparison of the two systems, the Dutch and the Swedish,
for the protection of infants is the following: the provision of
Article 22 (a) of the Swedish Law of June 6th, 1924, and the
measures taken in execution of this single provision are of the same
nature as those laid down in the Dutch law applicable according
to the Convention. Obviously, they are directed towards the interest
of the infant. The situation before the Child Welfare Board was
one for which the rules regarding Dutch guardianship would have
offered a similar solution. The care of the physical and moral
health of the child, as also for her intellectual and religious edu-
cation, the choice of schools, the selection of the place of residence
for the child best adapted to her interests, are in the hands of the
person who has the child’s custody under the supervision of the
authorities. Once the Convention is involved, it is not the local
law but the national law which prevails. In this case, the application
of Article 22 (a) has, in fact, in contravention of the Convention,
prevented the exercise of the guardian’s rights and, consequently,
of the rights of the Dutch authorities.

It should not be said that the removal of the infant constitutes
a danger in the sense of Article 22 (a). It is for the national guardian
and for the national authorities to see whether, in the circumstances,
a removal is possible or whether, temporarily, the child should stay
in Sweden. As we know, the guardian had already made arrange-
ments in this sense.

For these reasons, I am of opinion that the application of Arti-
cle 22 (a) of the Swedish Law of June 6th, 1924, should, in this case,
be judged incompatible with the Convention, with the exception of
the first taking in charge of the child in so far as that falls under
Article 7.

7. It follows from the foregoing that no obstacle can be placed
in the way of the application of the Convention of 1902, on the
ground that the whole subject of the Swedish law on protective

upbringing is outside the scope of the Convention, because of the
aim of this law to provide a social guarantee.

In considering the object of the whole of this law, the different
cases in which it may be applied are no longer distinguished. The
Swedish authorities had in view only the protection of the infant
against a danger concerning her physical or moral health, and this
in the family home. They applied Article 22 (a) only.

to the same criterion, there is a whole legislative sphere which is
much larger than that involved in the present case. Delictual and
quasi-delictual situations are included. There is a risk, therefore,
of the social guarantee aspect imposing itself imperatively in cases
where the interest of the infant prevails. For the same reason also
there is reluctance to admit the apparently unacceptable conse-
quences of a Swedish law which has an extraterritorial effect and
which would have to be applied to Swedish infants in a foreign
country. But these consequences do not arise because the Swedish
law is confined to children “within a (Swedish) commune” and
because if the Convention was applied to such Swedish infants, this
would merely mean that the local authorities tolerate the handing
over of such an infant to the person who is in charge of him.

Without making any imputations as to the aims of the Swedish
legislators, I think that it might be an attractive policy to include
in local legislation rules governing a whole series of matters which,
without such rules, would be covered by the Convention, or to
unite in one law provisions of a penal and a civil nature, or to pass
legislation covering the whole question of the custody of children
from the point of view of a social guarantee—and this in opposition
to the legislation of those States which, with a view to the protection
of children, have included provisions covering the same matter in
their Civil Code. Merely by means of the label affixed to a law, the
aim of the Convention could thus be defeated.

It is not, indeed, a question of another subject, but of another
purpose in the legislator’s mind. In this connection, the English
word “purpose” is more indicative than the French word “objet”.
The subject-matter is the legal relationship in question and the
rules which are applicable to it. In the present case, the legal
relationship is constituted by the personal situation of an infant
who is not under the puissance paternelle or the parental power of
her two parents; the legal rules are the provisions governing the
custody of such an infant. This subject-matter is the same in all
States.

legislators and the courts are guided by ‘‘pre-occupations of a
moral and social order”.

In fact, what is being done is to make an exception for the
application of public law enactments or the principles of inter-


CONV. OF 1902 (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE OFFERHAUS) 155

national ordre public, which thus come in again in disguise by the
window after having been chased out of the door.

The Applicant has rightly made an objection with regard to the
category of public law enactments. If indeed such a category
exists, it has by its absolute and static character a much wider
scope than the exception based on international ordre public, which
is relativist and dynamic and which, in any case, should be applied
with great prudence. This exception does at least allow an exami-
nation of the question whether, in a concrete case, the points of
attachment to the juridical system of the country of residence are
strong enough.

In the case of the Convention on guardianship, I would reject
the general exception based on international ordre public because
in the Hague Conventions which were drawn up at the Conferences
of 1893, 1894 and -1900 the general formula of ordre public was
deliberately rejected and the system of individual treatment of
special cases was adhered to—cases in which, for reasons of public
or social interest, a different conflict rule seemed necessary. (Actes
1893, I, pp. 37-38, 41, 46-47, 74 et seg. ; Actes 1894, pp. 15, 48, 118,
125 et seq.).

not included in the Convention, such as puissance paternelle and
the interdiction of adults. It is a question of terminology and
phrasing for the draftsmen of conventions. The laws on compulsory
education, vocational training and health supervision, regulate
other matters, but that does not mean that the guardian of an
infant of foreign nationality does not retain the right to decide the
residence of the infant and that he may not, by such decision, put
an end to the application of such laws. And if these laws had to be
complied with, the guardian would remain in personal contact
with the infant to look after his welfare. Everything here depends
on the circumstances of the case, and one must not generalize.

The distinguishing of the competence of administrative organs,
to show the powers of local tribunals, is not decisive. The desig-
nation as an administrative or a judicial organ is often accidental
or secondary. The Swedish Government has described the decision
of its Supreme Administrative Court as a judicial one. In the
Netherlands it is the Court which appoints the guardian and directs
the supervision of the guardianship.

Also, the application of the Convention does not lead to negative
conflicts of jurisdiction. Clearly, the measures of local supervision
are not enforceable in other States, but the institution of guardian-
ship, as a whole, as it is regulated by the national law, meets the
needs. With regard to the Dutch institutions, I would refer to the
provisions enumerated above, which include the measures to be
taken by the courts, as well as the action of the Guardianship


CONV. OF 1902 (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE OFFERHAUS) 156

Council, the Amsterdam Council being competent as regards every
infant of Dutch nationality not residing in the Netherlands (compare
Arts. 460 to 461d, B.W.). These provisions apply in the case of a
Netherlands infant residing in Sweden or elsewhere. The guardian
is responsible for the care of the infant’s health and well-being and
he can be removed or other measures can be applied should he fail
to discharge his obligations. The local authorities must respect
this application of the national law. Inversely, in the case of a
Swedish infant who is in the Netherlands or elsewhere, the local
authorities are obliged to respect the measures of guardianship
ordered in Sweden. In the “juridical community” between the
contracting States, which has been invoked as far back as the Acts
of 1893, it is the rules of the national law which must be observed,
in conformity with that reciprocity which is at the basis of the
Convention.

I conclude that only Article 22 (a) of the Swedish Law of June 6th,
1924, is in issue and that the maintenance of the measures of
protective upbringing is not in conformity with the obligations
binding upon Sweden by virtue of the 1902 Convention.
