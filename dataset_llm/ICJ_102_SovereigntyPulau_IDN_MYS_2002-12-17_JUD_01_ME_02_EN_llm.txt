1. The 1891 Convention between Britain and the Netherlands should
have been determinative of this case. It established a line beginning at
Broershoek on Borneo’s east coast and continuing in an eastward direc-



tion along the 4° 10° latitude. Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan clearly lie
south of this line, on the Indonesian side.

2. Beyond that, little else is clear. This case presents the Court with a
record full of ambiguities. That is no one’s fault: it is the fate of history
in obscure places. Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, at least until recently,
were not the stuff of which history is made.

3. To overcome that difficulty within the case’s factual record, how-
ever, the Court need not have had recourse to conjectures about
fragments of effectivités when it could, instead, have resorted to well-
established presumptions of law that are applicable to the interpretation
of the text and context of the 1891 Convention. More precisely, when, as
frequently occurred, the evidence presented was unclear or indecisive,
the Court could have applied rules of evidence to clarify not only the
issues central to this case but also to elucidate — for these and for future
litigants — the applicable principles by which the law shines a light on
that which is unclear to the naked eye.

4. A presumption of law draws on the common experience to make a
reasonable inference from what is known to what is unknowable. Such
inferences are crystallized in well-known principles or legal maxims, such
as res ipsa loquitur. Any rebuttable presumption can be contradicted by
evidence demonstrating its opposite, or by application of a stronger evi-
dentiary presumption such as the principle of absolute liability. In a
sense, then, a rebuttable presumption shifts the onus of proof to the party
seeking to disprove the deduction derived from it.

5. How is this relevant to the dispute over two tiny islands off Borneo?
I believe that when two powerful States, with a history of both conflict
and co-operation, negotiate a convention settling a long boundary in a
distant theatre of their colonial interaction, then this Court should pre-
sume that the boundary was meant to cover all the area’s potential points
of conflict.

6. Instead, the Court has relied on a narrow parsing of effectivités that
are (by its own admission) enveloped in ambiguity. I dissent, not because
I think that reasonable judges could not have concluded as this Court has
done, but, rather, because a visionary judiciary should have used the
opportunity here presented to clarify the adjectival law of evidence — the
presumptions — applicable to the interpretation of treaties intended to
resolve territorial and jurisdictional conflict. The applicable presumption
is straightforward: where a treaty specifies a boundary line or principle of
territorial allocation, it should be interpreted as broadly as necessary to
resolve any conflict of jurisdiction in the absence of clear evidence of a
contrary intent. As I will seek to demonstrate in part 8 below, such a pre-
sumption accords both with common intuition and with judicial practice.



7. In terms of the present case, the line established by the 1891 Anglo-
Dutch Convention at the eastern end of the agreement’s subject-matter
(the 4° 10” line) should have been presumed to apply broadly to the entire
area of the Parties’ interface east of Sebatik, subject only to prevailing
evidence to the contrary. The onus of proof, in other words, should have
been held to rest with those seeking to rebut a presumption of complete-
ness or closure. A treaty such as this one, resolving a vast area of poten-
tial conflict, is special. It seeks to transform a zone of conflict into a zone
of peace. Its purpose requires not just deference but generosity. It is not
to be construed by the gimlet eye as if it were a contract for the sale of
barley.

8. Of course, this is a case about very small islands. But, that the sub-
ject-matter of the case is small does not mean that it does not afford the
Court an auspicious occasion to clarify important law. The legal issues in
this case are ones that have arisen in other, weightier, contexts and they
will arise again in contexts more freighted than these. The Court’s deci-
sion, alas, does not elucidate the applicable normative standards. Quite
aside from which party wins a case, it is the international legal system
which loses when the Court fails broadly to address the legal issues and,
instead, focuses on deciding small questions of fact on ambiguous evi-
dence, eliciting little that can be of value to the corpus juris.

2. THE RoLE OF THE Ap Hoc JUDGE

9. Before adverting further to these matters, it seems in keeping with
this preference for developing the corpus juris that I express myself
regarding the appropriate role of the ad hoc judge. The subject has but
rarely been canvassed by those occupying this unusual position. An
exception is the separate opinion of Judge ad hoc Lauterpacht in the pro-
visional measures phase of the Application of the Convention on the Pre-
vention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Yugoslavia), Provisional Measures, Order of 13 September
1993 (I.C.J. Reports 1993, pp. 408-409, paras. 4-6); see also Judge
ad hoc Palmer, in his dissenting opinion in the Request for an Examina-
tion of the Situation in Accordance with Paragraph 63 of the Court's
Judgment of 20 December 1974 in the Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v.
France) Case, Order of 22 September 1995 (I.C.J. Reports 1995, pp. 420-
421, para. 118). I subscribe entirely to Judge ad hoc Lauterpacht’s useful
analysis, the gist of which is that ad hoc judges, in accordance with their
solemn declaration under Article 20 of the Statute, are bound to exercise
their function impartially and conscientiously, while also discharging:



“the special obligation to endeavour to ensure that, so far as is
reasonable, every relevant argument in favour of the party that has
appointed him has been fully appreciated in the course of collegial
consideration and, ultimately, is reflected — though not necessarily
accepted — in any separate or dissenting opinion that he may write”
(Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia),
Provisional Measures, Order of 13 September 1993, 1. C.J. Reports
1993, p. 409, para. 6).

As Judge ad hoc Nicolas Valticos has pointed out, the ad hoc judge is not
simply a representative of the appointing State. Notably, one — Judge ad
hoc Suzanne Bastid — has even disagreed on the merits with the position
of the appointing States. (See Nicolas Valticos “L’évolution de la notion
de juge ad hoc”, Revue hellénique de droit international (RHDI), Vol. 50,
1997, pp. 11-12; and Hubert Thierry, “Au sujet du juge ad hoc”, Liber
Amicorum “In Memoriam” of Judge José Maria Ruda, 2000, p. 285.)

10. The nub of the matter is this: the ad hoc judge must always ensure
that the appointing State’s arguments are fully addressed by the
Court, whether or not they convince the majority of the judges.
Between March 1948 (Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania))
and July 2002 (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo ( Republic of Guinea v. Democratic
Republic of the Congo)) there have been ad hoc judges in 45 cases and
53 phases of cases before this Court. Of these, 29 have written dissenting
opinions, corresponding quite closely to the number of ad hoc judges
appointed by losing parties. That, however, does not argue against the
integrity of the institution of ad hoc judges. Rather, it demonstrates that,
when a State is the losing party, the ad hoc judge it appointed has an even
greater obligation to ensure that the Court’s judgment accurately and
fully reflects the careful consideration given by the Court to the losing
State’s representations. The drafting of the dissent attests to the richness
of the Court’s collegial deliberative process.

11. The function of the dissent, therefore, is multiple. It assures the
losing party that its arguments, far from being overlooked, were con-
sidered extensively by the entire Court. It facilitates the reasoned and
balanced exchange of research and written views among the judges
during the deliberative process. And, perhaps, it presents to the law’s
universal market place of ideas certain principles of law and nuances of
analysis which, even if not adopted in the instant case, may be of use in
another, as yet unforeseen, context.

12. The ad hoc judge, like any other judge authoring a separate opinion,
is accorded a sacred freedom. To be preserved, it must be used. As
Judge ad hoc Bula-Bula has written, the ad hoc’s “traditional practice
would seem to be characterized by its freedom” (Arrest Warrant of
11 April 2000 {Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judg-


/

/


ment, LC.J. Reports 2002, p. 100, para. 2, separate opinion of Judge ad
hoc Bula-Bula). That freedom, of course, quite simply, is to write as one
wills: to be the sole author of an opinion, unencumbered by a majority’s
need, sometimes, to find common ground through compromise and cre-

3. THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES IN DISPUTE

13. That the Court’s Judgment leaves ambiguous the answers to some
questions raised in this case is as apparent as that this may have been
inevitable given the relative paucity of unambiguous controlling facts.

14. In my reading of the pleadings and the Court’s Judgment it emerges
that there are three principal points of contention:

(1) whether the 1891 Convention should be read to extend the 4° 10°
“boundary” line to allocate islands east of the east coast of Sebatik ;

(2) whether, on the contrary, a “chain of title” exists which establishes
sovereignty to Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, successively, in the
Sultan of Sulu who transferred it to Spain, which transferred it to
the United States, which transferred it to Great Britain, which,
ultimately, transferred it to Malaysia; and

(3) whether, if the answers to (1) and (2) are both in the negative, the
two disputed islands’ resultant, unresolved status (terra nullius) can
be said to have been resolved in favour of either Party by reason of a
preponderance of effectivités exercised by one or the other.

4. ASSESSING THE COURT'S ANSWERS

15. The Court answers both questions No. 1 and No. 2 in the nega-
tive: the 1891 Convention is held not to be applicable to Pulau Ligitan
and Pulau Sipadan, and the Court finds no controlling “chain of title”
leading to Malaysian sovereignty over the islands. It therefore relies on a
relative weighing of the effectivités of the Parties to conclude that those
of Britain and Malaysia are superior to those of Indonesia.

16. I will leave to the next section my grounds for disagreeing with the
Court’s response to question No. 1. 1 find myself fully in agreement with
the Court in its response to question No. 2. For reasons set out precisely
in the majority’s opinion, I reject Malaysia’s “chain of title” theory as
unsupported by the events cited as demonstrative of it. It is unnecessary
for me to restate the Court's conclusions in this regard, with which I
wholly concur.



17. Question No. 3 [ find difficult — and ultimately unnecessary — to
answer categorically. I do not agree, but neither do I really disagree, with
the Court in its weighing up of the effectivités adduced by Indonesia and
Malaysia to support their respective claims of title. To weigh, on the one
hand, occasional administration of turtle egg harvesting and of a bird
sanctuary — neither of these, apparently, in situ — together with the
establishment of a few navigational lights (by Britain/Malaysia) against,
on the other hand, naval and air patrolling and piracy-control (by Indo-
nesia) appears to me like trying to weigh precisely a handful of feathers
against a handful of grass: it can be done, but not very convincingly. The
Court has not set out a coherent table of weights and measures for assess-
ing and comparing the effectivités here pleaded, nor could it be expected
to do so, given their ephemeral nature. Nevertheless, it is not convincing
to give preference to a very few activities by one party while discounting
those of the other party without some effort to develop neutral principles
by which the relative weight of their respective effectivités can be
compared.

18. The problem of their comparative weight is augmented by the
brevity of the period from which evidence of effectivités may properly
be pleaded. There is no evidence before this Court that, prior to 1930,
Britain believed itself to have title to either Ligitan or Sipadan. Whatever
slender acts of administration might have been undertaken prior to that
date by the British North Borneo Company were not claimed to have
been made à titre de souverain. As Judge Huber said in the Island of Pal-
mas case, the demonstration of effectivités must consist “in the actual
display of State activities, such as belongs only to the territorial sover-
eign” (Island of Palmas (Netherlands! United States of America), Award
of 4 April 1928, Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. IT,
p. 839). To qualify, they must be activities undertaken not as a good
neighbour or a gratuitous intermeddler, but as an exercise of sovereign
responsibility for the territory in question. The harvesting activities of
fishermen were found not to constitute occupation a titre de souverain
by this Court in the Kasikili/Sedudu Island (BotswanalNamibia) case
(Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1095, para. 75) and the same
principle is applicable to turtle egg collectors. Similarly, the construction
by Malaysia of lighthouses on Ligitan and Sipadan may or may not be
evidence of occupation à titre de souverain when seen by itself, without
reference to the 1891 Convention. Even so, the Arbitral Award of 9 Octo-
ber 1998 between Eritrea and Yemen stated: “The operation or main-
tenance of lighthouses and navigational aids is normally connected to
the preservation of safe navigation, and not normally taken as a test of
sovereignty.” (Award of the Arbitral Tribunal in the First Stage of the
Proceedings ( Territorial Sovereignty and Scope of the Dispute), 9 October



1998, p. 91, para. 328; see also to same effect Minquiers and Ecrehos,

5. THE 1891 CONVENTION

22. If the 1891 Convention between Britain and the Netherlands were
applicable to Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, that would be decisive in
this case. Is it? It’s Article IV establishes a line beginning at the east coast
of Borneo at 4°10" latitude and proceeding in an easterly direction
“across the Island of Sebittik . . .”. What, crucially, is in dispute is
whether the words of Article IV, in allocating to the British North Bor-
neo Company the territory north of this line and “the portion south of
that parallel to the Netherlands”, intended it to stop at the east coast of
“Sebittik” or to continue on its mission of allocation in an easterly direc-
tion. If the former, then the 1891 Convention would have nothing to say
about title to Ligitan and Sipadan, thereby properly focusing the Court’s
attention on subsequent effectivités. If the latter, however, the Conven-
tion would allocate Ligitan and Sipadan to the Netherlands, thereby
making recourse to subsequent effectivités irrelevant in the absence of
evidence of Dutch abandonment of title.

23. What, then, if anything, does the 1891 Convention say about the
two contested islands? Nothing at all. But that should not be an end to
the Court’s search for its meaning. More specifically, what adjectival law
may be of help to the Court in its task of construing the Convention?

24. The first stop in any search for applicable legal principles to guide
the Court is the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Article 31 of
that instrument lays down the principle that the text of a treaty is to be
understood in its “ordinary meaning” and “in the light of [the treaty’s]
object and purpose”. It is acknowledged by the Parties and this Court
that these two adjectival legal principles — requiring a search for the
words “ordinary meaning” and the Convention’s overall contextual
“object and purpose” — must guide the Court.

6. THE “ORDINARY MEANING” PRINCIPLE

25. First, then, the Court is obliged to give their “ordinary meaning”
to Article IV’s words. Key, here, is the phrase “across the Island of Sebit-

7. THE “OBJECT AND PURPOSE” PRINCIPLE

26. That, however, cannot exhaust our search for meaning and intent.
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention also alerts us to interpret treaties in
accordance with their “object and purpose”. To the same effect is the
Decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission regarding Delimi-
tation of the Border between the State of Eritrea and the Federal Demo-
cratic Republic of Ethiopia (13 April 2002, para. 3.4). The key provisions
of the Vienna Convention had become the customary law of treaty
interpretation.

27. While the text of the Convention is of little help in determining an
“ordinary meaning”, it is quite responsive to the quest for its “object and
purpose”. The 1891 Dutch-British Convention’s preamble stipulates its
purpose: that of “defining the boundaries between the Netherlands]

cites a British Foreign Office Minute that sets out a proposal for a com-
promise line which, albeit along latitude 4° and thus south of 4°10’, is
eastward to longitude 118° 44" 30”, well east of Sipidan (but not Ligitan):
the point being that the British, all along, were also thinking about an
allocational line extending to territories in the sea east of Sebatik (Reply
of Indonesia, Vol. 1, p. 21, para. 1.31; and p. 22, Map 1).

31. That the Dutch, certainly, were thinking about a line prolonged
eastward beyond Sebatik is apparent from the map attached to the
Explanatory Memorandum by means of which the Dutch Government
requested ratification of the 1891 Convention by its Parliament (States-
General) in compliance with the Netherlands Constitution and with

8. THE PRESUMPTION OF THE CONCLUSIVENESS AND COMPLETENESS
OF DEFINED FRONTIERS

36. Still, the words of the 1891 Convention and the sparse evidence of
the parties’ object and purpose in entering into the treaty do not make



absolutely clear that the 4° 10” line was, or was not, intended to extend
beyond Sebatik as far east as Ligitan and Sipadan. What does emerge
with some clarity is that the Netherlands entered the agreement in the
belief that the 4° 10’ line extended east of Sebatik and that, early in the
run-up to the negotiations leading to the Convention, the British also
thought that the designated eastward line could extend east of Borneo
beyond Sebatik.

37. We do not know, however, how far east the parties may have
expected the line to extend. A probable explanation for the failure of
either party to specify a terminal point for the 4° 10’ line is that they may
have been uncertain as to where the effect of such a line would begin to
trench upon Spanish (or Sulu) titles. While the Netherlands sovereignty
clearly extended for many hundreds of miles southward of any desig-
nated eastward limit, the extent of British possessions northward of such
a terminal point would have been far from clear in 1891. It may thus
have appeared prudent to leave the eastern terminus of the 4°10” line
indeterminate, since its length need not have affected actual British or
Dutch jurisdiction but might unnecessarily have aroused Spanish (or
Sulu) concerns. This, too, of course is pure speculation. Once again, all
that we know for sure is that the Netherlands thought that the 1891 Con-
vention established a line at 4° 10” that did continue east of Sebatik and
that the British knew of this and voiced no objection.

38. With so much being uncertain, this Court essentially had two
divergent paths along which it could have proceeded. It could either have
left the disposition of the matter to be settled by a weighing up of the few
real effectivités claimed to have been conducted by each Party, or it could
have enunciated a legal presumption by which to dispel the uncertainty
created by the examination of the words, purpose and context of the
1891 Convention. It chose the former course, whereas I prefer the latter.

39. On its chosen path, the Court relies substantially on a weighing of
the Parties’ contending factual evidence of effectivités. As to this I can
but observe once again that I find it unpersuasive: this weighing of a
handful of feathers against a handful of grass. Moreover, the admissi-
bility in evidence of these effectivités is contingent upon an absence of any
legal title derived from a treaty. This was the conclusion of the Chamber
of this Court in the Frontier Dispute ( Burkina FasolRepublic of Mali)
case (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 586-587, para. 63). Effectivités,
also in the present case, are of use only on the assumption of an absence
of legal title.

40. If the 1891 Convention did confer legal title on one of the Parties,
effectivités cannot override that title, absent evidence of its abandonment
(Sovereignty over Certain Frontier Land (Belgium/Netherlands), Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1959, pp. 227-230). But does the 1891 Convention



establish such title? We have already observed the ambiguities inherent in
the text. What seems to me to have been demonstrated is that the treaty
established a line, that the Dutch believed it to have continued eastward
of the island of Sebatik, and that the British did not rebut that belief. The
rest is speculation.

41. Did it extend so far eastward — at least to 119° east longitude —
as to allocate to the Netherlands the title to two tiny islands lying just to
