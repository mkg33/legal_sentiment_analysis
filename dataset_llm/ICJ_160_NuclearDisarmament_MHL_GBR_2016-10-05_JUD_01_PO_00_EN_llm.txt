        II. First Preliminary Objection: Absence of a Dispute

   26. In its ﬁrst preliminary objection, the United Kingdom argues that,
on the date of the ﬁling of the Marshall Islands’ Application, there was
no “justiciable dispute” between the Marshall Islands and the United King-
dom. Consequently, it considers that the Court lacks jurisdiction to
address all of the Marshall Islands’ claims and/or that those claims are
inadmissible.
   27. The United Kingdom contends that there is a principle of custom-
ary international law which requires that a State intending to invoke the
responsibility of another State must give notice of its claim to that State,
such notice being a condition of the existence of a dispute. It asserts that
this principle is reﬂected in Article 43 of the International Law Commis-
sion’s Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrong-
ful Acts (hereinafter “ILC Articles on State Responsibility”) and
provisions to that eﬀect can be found in various compulsory dispute set-
tlement arrangements under international law. The United Kingdom
argues that prior notiﬁcation of claims was also held by the Court to be a
precondition to the existence of a dispute in both the case concerning
Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation) and the case
concerning Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite
(Belgium v. Senegal).

   28. The United Kingdom asserts that these requirements have not been
satisﬁed in the present case. With regard to the two statements particu-
larly relied upon by the Marshall Islands, the United Kingdom maintains
that neither the content of these statements nor the circumstances in
which they were made provide any evidence that a dispute existed between
the Parties at the date on which the Application was ﬁled. The ﬁrst state-
ment was made on 26 September 2013 at the High-Level Meeting of the
General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament, when the Minister for For-
eign Aﬀairs of the Marshall Islands “urge[d] all nuclear weapons states to
intensify eﬀorts to address their responsibilities in moving towards an
eﬀective and secure disarmament”. The Respondent observes that the
statement did not speciﬁcally mention the United Kingdom, and argues
that it could not in any way be viewed as invoking the latter’s responsibil-
ity under international law for any breach of the NPT or of customary
international law. The second statement, also of a general nature, was
made on 13 February 2014, just over two months before the ﬁling of the
Application before the Court, at the Second Conference on the Human-
itarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons held in Nayarit, Mexico, and reads as
follows:

        “[T]he Marshall Islands is convinced that multilateral negotiations
      on achieving and sustaining a world free of nuclear weapons are long


847           nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

      overdue. Indeed we believe that States possessing nuclear arsenals are
      failing to fulﬁl their legal obligations in this regard. Immediate com-
      mencement and conclusion of such negotiations is required by legal
      obligation of nuclear disarmament resting upon each and every State
      under Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and customary
      international law.”

The United Kingdom observes that it was not present at this conference,
and contends that the Marshall Islands took no steps to bring this statement
to its attention. The United Kingdom adds that the Marshall Islands has
had other opportunities to notify it of the alleged dispute but did not do so.
   29. The Respondent argues that, at the date of the ﬁling of the Appli-
cation, the Marshall Islands had not taken the most basic steps to notify
the United Kingdom of its claim, or any aspect of the alleged dispute or
even disagreement between them. Furthermore, the United Kingdom
contends that it is not enough that there is a public record of views that
are not the same; there needs to be an exchange between the parties to a
dispute. Accordingly, it argues, there was no conﬂict of legal positions
between the Marshall Islands and the United Kingdom, and thus no “jus-
ticiable dispute”. The United Kingdom adds that the ﬁling of an applica-
tion cannot amount both to notice and the crystallization of an incipient
dispute. Similarly, post-application conduct cannot on its own establish
the existence of a “justiciable dispute” between the Parties at the time
of the seisin of the Court; it may only be used to deﬁne the scope or
subject-matter of the dispute.

                                      *
   30. The Marshall Islands contends that the ﬁrst preliminary objection
of the United Kingdom should be rejected.
   31. The Marshall Islands asserts that there is no general principle
imposing on a State that intends to institute proceedings the obligation to
notify the other State of this intention or of its claims prior to seising the
adjudicatory body. It argues that Article 43 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility is irrelevant as that provision does not relate to the institu-
tion of proceedings before an international court or tribunal. In support
of that argument, the Marshall Islands refers to the ILC’s Commentary
to Article 44, which indicates that the ILC Articles on State Responsibil-
ity “are not concerned with questions of the jurisdiction of international
courts and tribunals, or in general with the conditions for the admissibil-
ity of cases”. It further submits that the United Kingdom’s attempt to
infer a principle of general application from speciﬁc provisions in various
international instruments is untenable and does not ﬁnd any support in
the case law of international courts and tribunals.
   32. The Marshall Islands adds that the Court has consistently denied
the existence of a general requirement of prior notice of the intention to
institute proceedings, and that the Belgium v. Senegal and Georgia v. Rus-


848          nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

sian Federation cases do not support the United Kingdom’s allegation of
such a prior notiﬁcation requirement. The Marshall Islands also avers
that the Court has never recognized the existence of a general require-
ment of prior notiﬁcation of claims, and that a perusal of its case law
reveals that it has always avoided setting overly rigid parameters to deter-
mine the existence of a dispute, in particular allowing for the possibility
that a dispute can “crystallize” as a consequence of the claim made by a
State against the consistent course of conduct of another State (e.g., Cer-
tain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 19, para. 25; Land and Maritime Boundary
between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 317, para. 93; Application of
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), pp. 614-615, para. 29).
   33. In the Marshall Islands’ view, the existence of a dispute is evi-
denced by the opposing attitudes of the Parties with respect to the ques-
tion of the United Kingdom’s compliance with Article VI of the NPT and
the corresponding customary law obligations. First, the Marshall Islands
avers that it clearly communicated its claim to all States possessing
nuclear weapons — including the United Kingdom — through its 13 Feb-
ruary 2014 statement at the Nayarit conference (see paragraph 28 above).
According to the Marshall Islands, the United Kingdom must have been
aware of this statement — even if it did not attend the relevant meet-
ing — because all statements and records therefrom were publicly avail-
able and easily accessible, including on the Internet. Subsidiarily, the
Marshall Islands contends that even if one were to accept the test of prior
notice of the claim suggested by the United Kingdom (which the Appli-
cant interprets as requiring that the Respondent “be aware of the claim of
the other Party so as to be given the opportunity to respond to such
claim”), this statement would fulﬁl that requirement.
   34. The Marshall Islands further argues that it also gave notice of its
claim by means of its Application.
   35. For the Marshall Islands, the opposition of the United Kingdom to
this claim is evidenced by the Respondent’s own conduct. It adds that the
statements made by the United Kingdom in the preliminary objections
and during the hearings show that it continues to oppose the merits of the
claim. Moreover, the Marshall Islands refers to the Parties’ respective vot-
ing records in multilateral fora as demonstrating the opposition of views
between them. Finally, according to the Marshall Islands, such opposition
results from the fact that the United Kingdom has engaged, and continues
to engage, in a course of conduct alleged to be in breach of international
law, as well as from statements of the Government of the United Kingdom
in parliamentary debates in 2006 and 2010, stating that the renewal of its
nuclear deterrent was consistent with its obligations under the NPT.

   36. Under Article 38 of the Statute, the function of the Court is to
decide in accordance with international law disputes that States submit to
it. Under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Court has jurisdic-
tion in all “legal disputes” that may arise between States parties to the
Statute having made a declaration in accordance with that provision. The
existence of a dispute between the Parties is thus a condition of the
Court’s jurisdiction.
   37. According to the established case law of the Court, a dispute is “a
disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views or of
interests” between parties (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment
No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 11). In order for a dispute to
exist, “[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed
by the other” (South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v.
South Africa), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962,
p. 328). The two sides must “‘hold clearly opposite views concerning the
question of the performance or non-performance of certain’ international
obligations” (Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces
in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 26, para. 50, citing Interpretation of
Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advi-
sory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).

   38. The Court’s determination of the existence of a dispute is a matter
of substance, and not a question of form or procedure (cf. Application of
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Dis-
crimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 84, para. 30; Interpretation of Judg-
ments Nos. 7 and 8 (Factory at Chorzów) [Germany v. Poland], Judgment
No. 11, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 13, pp. 10-11). Prior negotiations are
not required where the Court has been seised on the basis of declarations
made pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute, unless one of the
relevant declarations so provides (Land and Maritime Boundary between
Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 322, para. 109). Moreover, “although a
formal diplomatic protest may be an important step to bring a claim of
one party to the attention of the other, such a formal protest is not a
necessary condition” for the existence of a dispute (Alleged Violations of
Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v.
Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I),
p. 32, para. 72). Similarly, notice of an intention to ﬁle a case is not
required as a condition for the seisin of the Court (Land and Maritime
Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 297, para. 39).

   39. Whether a dispute exists is a matter for objective determination by
the Court which must turn on an examination of the facts (Alleged Viola-
tions of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nica-


850            nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

ragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2016 (I), p. 26, para. 50). For that purpose, the Court takes into account
in particular any statements or documents exchanged between the parties
(Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v.
Senegal), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), pp. 443-445, paras. 50-55),
as well as any exchanges made in multilateral settings (Application of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Dis-
crimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 94, para. 51, p. 95, para. 53). In so
doing, it pays special attention to “the author of the statement or docu-
ment, their intended or actual addressee, and their content” (ibid., p. 100,
para. 63).

  40. The conduct of the parties may also be relevant, especially when
there have been no diplomatic exchanges (Alleged Violations of Sovereign
Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colom-
bia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), pp. 32-33,
paras. 71 and 73). As the Court has aﬃrmed,
      “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views or
      interests, or the positive opposition of the claim of one party by the
      other need not necessarily be stated expressis verbis . . . [T]he position
      or the attitude of a party can be established by inference, whatever
      the professed view of that party.” (Land and Maritime Boundary
      between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary
      Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 315, para. 89.)


In particular, the Court has previously held that “the existence of a dis-
pute may be inferred from the failure of a State to respond to a claim in
circumstances where a response is called for” (Application of the Interna-
tional Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 84, para. 30, citing Land and Maritime Bound-
ary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 315, para. 89).
   41. The evidence must show that the parties “hold clearly opposite
views” with respect to the issue brought before the Court (see para-
graph 37 above). As reﬂected in previous decisions of the Court in which
the existence of a dispute was under consideration, a dispute exists when
it is demonstrated, on the basis of the evidence, that the respondent was
aware, or could not have been unaware, that its views were “positively
opposed” by the applicant (Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and
Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 26, para. 73; Appli-
cation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objec-


851           nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

tions, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 99, para. 61, pp. 109-110,
para. 87, p. 117, para. 104).

   42. In principle, the date for determining the existence of a dispute is
the date on which the application is submitted to the Court (Alleged Vio-
lations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea
(Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2016 (I), p. 27, para. 52; Application of the International Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian
Federation), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I),
p. 85, para. 30). Indeed, when it is stated in Article 38, paragraph 1, of the
Court’s Statute that the Court’s function is “to decide in accordance with
international law such disputes as are submitted to it”, this relates to dis-
putes existing at the time of their submission.
   43. Conduct subsequent to the application (or the application itself)
may be relevant for various purposes, in particular to conﬁrm the exis-
tence of a dispute (East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 100, para. 22 and p. 104, para. 32), to clarify its
subject-matter (Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean
(Bolivia v. Chile), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2015 (II), p. 602, para. 26) or to determine whether the dispute has disap-
peared as of the time when the Court makes its decision (Nuclear Tests
(Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, pp. 270-271,
para. 55; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1974, p. 476, para. 58).
   However, neither the application nor the parties’ subsequent conduct
and statements made during the judicial proceedings can enable the Court
to ﬁnd that the condition of the existence of a dispute has been fulﬁlled in
the same proceedings (Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or
Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II),
pp. 444-445, paras. 53-55). If the Court had jurisdiction with regard to
disputes resulting from exchanges in the proceedings before it, a respon-
dent would be deprived of the opportunity to react before the institution
of proceedings to the claim made against its own conduct. Furthermore,
the rule that the dispute must in principle exist prior to the ﬁling of the
application would be subverted.

                                    * *
   44. The Court notes that the Marshall Islands, by virtue of the suﬀer-
ing which its people endured as a result of it being used as a site for exten-
sive nuclear testing programs, has special reasons for concern about
nuclear disarmament (see paragraph 16 above). But that fact does not
remove the need to establish that the conditions for the Court’s jurisdic-
tion are met. While it is a legal matter for the Court to determine whether
it has jurisdiction, it remains for the Applicant to demonstrate the facts
underlying its case that a dispute exists (Border and Transborder Armed


852          nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 75, para. 16).

   45. As noted above at paragraphs 27-29, the United Kingdom relies on
the fact that the Marshall Islands did not commence negotiations or give
notice to it of the claim that is the subject of the Application to support
its contention that there is no dispute between the Parties. The
United Kingdom lays particular emphasis on Article 43 of the ILC Arti-
cles on State Responsibility, which requires an injured State to “give
notice of its claim” to the allegedly responsible State. Article 48, para-
graph 3, applies that requirement mutatis mutandis to a State other than
an injured State which invokes responsibility. However, the Court notes
that the ILC’s commentary speciﬁes that the Articles “are not concerned
with questions of the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, or
in general with the conditions for the admissibility of cases brought before
such courts or tribunals” (see ILC Commentary on the Draft Articles on
the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of
the International Law Commission, United Nations doc. A/56/10, 2001,
paragraph 1 of the Commentary on Article 44, pp. 120-121). Moreover,
the Court has rejected the view that notice or prior negotiations are
required where it has been seised on the basis of declarations made pursu-
ant to Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, unless one of those declara-
tions so provides. The Court’s jurisprudence treats the question of the
existence of a dispute as a jurisdictional one that turns on whether there
is, in substance, a dispute, not on what form that dispute takes or whether
the respondent has been notiﬁed (see paragraph 38 above).


  46. The Marshall Islands seeks to demonstrate that it had a dispute
with the United Kingdom in essentially four ways. First, it refers to its
own statements, as formulated in multilateral fora. Secondly, it argues
that the very ﬁling of the Application, as well as the positions expressed
by the Parties in the current proceedings, show the existence of a dispute
between the Parties. Thirdly, it relies on the United Kingdom’s voting
records on nuclear disarmament in multilateral fora. Fourthly, it relies on
the United Kingdom’s conduct both before and after the ﬁling of the
Application.

   47. The Marshall Islands accepts that no bilateral diplomatic exchanges
have taken place on these issues. This is despite the fact that a number of
bilateral exchanges, including visits by senior United Kingdom personnel
to the Marshall Islands, took place in the period prior to the ﬁling of the
Application at which such issues could have been raised.

   48. The Marshall Islands refers to a number of statements made in
multilateral fora before the date of the ﬁling of its Application which, in
its view, suﬃce to establish the existence of a dispute. As the Court has


853           nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

already explained, the opposition of the Parties’ views could also be dem-
onstrated by exchanges made in multilateral settings (see paragraph 39
above). In such a setting, however, the Court must give particular atten-
tion, inter alia, to the content of a party’s statement and to the identity of
the intended addressees, in order to determine whether that statement,
together with any reaction thereto, show that the parties before it held
“clearly opposite views” (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above). The question
in this case is therefore whether the statements invoked by the Marshall
Islands are suﬃcient to demonstrate the existence of such opposition.


   49. The Marshall Islands relies on the statement made at the High-Level
Meeting of the General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament, on 26 Sep-
tember 2013 by its Minister for Foreign Aﬀairs, “urg[ing] all nuclear
weapons states to intensify eﬀorts to address their responsibilities in mov-
ing towards an eﬀective and secure disarmament”. However, this state-
ment is formulated in hortatory terms and cannot be understood as an
allegation that the United Kingdom (or any other nuclear power) was in
breach of any of its legal obligations. It does not mention the obligation
to negotiate, nor does it say that the nuclear-weapon States are failing to
meet their obligations in this regard. It suggests that they are making
“eﬀorts” to address their responsibilities, and calls for an intensiﬁcation
of those eﬀorts, rather than deploring a failure to act. Moreover, a state-
ment can give rise to a dispute only if it refers to the subject-matter of a
claim “with suﬃcient clarity to enable the State against which [that] claim
is made to identify that there is, or may be, a dispute with regard to that
subject-matter” (Application of the International Convention on the Elimi-
nation of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federa-
tion), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 85,
para. 30). While the Court reached that conclusion in the context of a
compromissory clause, the same reasoning applies to a dispute over any
obligation regardless of the underlying jurisdictional basis alleged, since
the Court made clear that it was dealing with the requirements of a dis-
pute in general (ibid., p. 84, para. 29). The 2013 statement relied upon by
the Marshall Islands does not meet these requirements.



  50. The statement made by the Marshall Islands at the Nayarit confer-
ence on 13 February 2014 (see paragraph 28 above) goes further than the
2013 statement, in that it contains a sentence asserting that “States pos-
sessing nuclear arsenals are failing to fulﬁl their legal obligations” under
Article VI of the NPT and customary international law. However, the
United Kingdom was not present at the Nayarit conference. Further, the
subject of the conference was not speciﬁcally the question of negotiations
with a view to nuclear disarmament, but the broader question of the
humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, and while this statement con-


854          nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

tains a general criticism of the conduct of all nuclear-weapon States, it
does not specify the conduct of the United Kingdom that gave rise to the
alleged breach. Such a speciﬁcation would have been particularly neces-
sary if, as the Marshall Islands contends, the Nayarit statement was
aimed at invoking the international responsibility of the Respondent on
the grounds of a course of conduct which had remained unchanged for
many years. Given its very general content and the context in which it
was made, that statement did not call for a speciﬁc reaction by the United
Kingdom. Accordingly, no opposition of views can be inferred from the
absence of any such reaction. The Nayarit statement is insuﬃcient to
bring into existence, between the Marshall Islands and the United King-
dom, a speciﬁc dispute as to the scope of Article VI of the NPT and the
asserted corresponding customary international law obligation, or as to
the United Kingdom’s compliance with such obligations.

  51. None of the other more general statements relied on by the Mar-
shall Islands in this case supports the existence of a dispute, since none
articulates an alleged breach by the United Kingdom of the obligation
enshrined in Article VI of the NPT or the corresponding customary inter-
national law obligation invoked by the Marshall Islands.

   52. In all the circumstances, on the basis of those statements — whether
taken individually or together — it cannot be said that the United King-
dom was aware, or could not have been unaware, that the Marshall
Islands was making an allegation that the United Kingdom was in breach
of its obligations.
   53. Secondly, the Marshall Islands argues that the very ﬁling of the
Application could suﬃce to establish the existence of a dispute: “nothing
excludes the possibility of conceiving the seisin of the Court as an appro-
priate and perfectly legitimate mode by which the injured State ‘notiﬁes
its claim’ to the State whose international responsibility is invoked”. It
also points to other statements made in the course of the proceedings by
both Parties as evidence of their opposition of views.
   54. The Marshall Islands relies on three cases in support of its conten-
tion that the statements made by the Parties during the proceedings may
serve to evidence the existence of a dispute (see paragraph 32 above).
However, these cases do not support this contention. In the case concern-
ing Certain Property, the existence of a dispute was clearly referenced by
bilateral exchanges between the parties prior to the date of the applica-
tion (Certain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany), Preliminary Objec-
tions, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 19, para. 25). The reference to
subsequent materials in the Cameroon v. Nigeria case related to the scope
of the dispute, not to its existence (Land and Maritime Boundary between
Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 317, para. 93). Moreover, while it is
true that the Court did not explicitly reference any evidence before the
ﬁling of the application demonstrating the existence of a dispute in its


855          nuclear arms and disarmament (judgment)

Judgment in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Yugoslavia), in the particular context of that case, which
involved an ongoing armed conﬂict, the prior conduct of the parties was
suﬃcient to establish the existence of a dispute (Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 614, paras. 27-29). Instead, the
issues the Court focused on were not the date when the dispute arose but
the proper subject-matter of that dispute, whether it fell within the scope
of the relevant compromissory clause, and whether it “persist[ed]” at the
date of the Court’s decision. As stated above, although statements made
or claims advanced in or even subsequently to the application may be
relevant for various purposes — notably in clarifying the scope of the
dispute submitted — they cannot create a dispute de novo, one that does
not already exist (see paragraph 43 above).


   55. Thirdly, the Marshall Islands refers to the Parties’ voting records
in multilateral fora on nuclear disarmament (see paragraph 35 above).
For example, in response to a question from a Member of the Court, it
referred to General Assembly resolution 68/32 of 5 December 2013, enti-
tled “Follow-up to the 2013 High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly
on Nuclear Disarmament”. Paragraph 2 of that resolution called for
“urgent compliance with the legal obligations and the fulﬁlment of the
commitments undertaken on nuclear disarmament”. In paragraph 4, the
General Assembly called for “the urgent commencement of negotiations
in the Conference on Disarmament for the early conclusion of a compre-
hensive convention on nuclear weapons”. The resolution was passed by
137 votes to 28 with 20 abstentions. The Marshall Islands voted in favour
of the resolution; the United Kingdom voted against.

   56. In the Court’s view, considerable care is required before inferring
from votes cast on resolutions before political organs such as the General
Assembly conclusions as to the existence or not of a legal dispute on some
issue covered by a resolution. The wording of a resolution, and votes or
patterns of voting on resolutions of the same subject-matter, may consti-
tute relevant evidence of the existence of a legal dispute in some circum-
stances, particularly where statements were made by way of explanation
of vote. However, some resolutions contain a large number of diﬀerent
propositions; a State’s vote on such resolutions cannot by itself be taken
as indicative of the position of that State on each and every proposition
within that resolution, let alone of the existence of a legal dispute between
that State and another State regarding one of those propositions.


  57. Fourthly, the Marshall Islands invokes the United Kingdom’s con-

modernizing its nuclear weapons, together with statements that its con-
duct is consistent with its treaty obligations. According to the Marshall
Islands, this conduct and assertion of legality, juxtaposed with statements
of the Marshall Islands containing a complaint aimed precisely at that
conduct and the legal position of the United Kingdom, demonstrate the
existence of a dispute as to the scope of and compliance with its obliga-
tions under Article VI of the NPT and a corresponding customary inter-
national law obligation.

   The Court recalls that the question whether there is a dispute in a par-
ticular contentious case turns on the evidence of opposition of views (see
paragraphs 37, 39 and 40 above). In this regard, conduct of a respondent
can contribute to a ﬁnding by the Court that the views of the parties are
in opposition (see paragraph 40 above). However, as the Court has previ-
ously concluded (see paragraphs 49-52 above), in the present case none of
the statements that were made in a multilateral context by the Marshall
Islands oﬀered any particulars regarding the United Kingdom’s conduct.
On the basis of such statements, it cannot be said that the United King-
dom was aware, or could not have been unaware, that the Marshall
Islands was making an allegation that the United Kingdom was in breach
of its obligations. In this context, the conduct of the United Kingdom
does not provide a basis for ﬁnding a dispute between the two States
before the Court.

  58. The Court therefore concludes that the ﬁrst preliminary objection
made by the United Kingdom must be upheld. It follows that the Court
does not have jurisdiction under Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute.
Consequently, it is not necessary for the Court to deal with the other
objections raised by the United Kingdom.

  59. For these reasons,
  The Court,
  (1) By eight votes to eight, by the President’s casting vote,
  Upholds the ﬁrst preliminary objection to jurisdiction raised by the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, based on the
absence of a dispute between the Parties;
  in favour: President Abraham; Judges Owada, Greenwood, Xue, Donoghue,
     Gaja, Bhandari, Gevorgian;
  against: Vice-President Yusuf; Judges Tomka, Bennouna, Cançado Trindade,
     Sebutinde, Robinson, Crawford; Judge ad hoc Bedjaoui;

  (2) By nine votes to seven,
  Finds that it cannot proceed to the merits of the case.
  in favour: President Abraham; Judges Owada, Tomka, Greenwood, Xue,
    Donoghue, Gaja, Bhandari, Gevorgian;
  against: Vice-President Yusuf; Judges Bennouna, Cançado Trindade,
    Sebutinde, Robinson, Crawford; Judge ad hoc Bedjaoui.
