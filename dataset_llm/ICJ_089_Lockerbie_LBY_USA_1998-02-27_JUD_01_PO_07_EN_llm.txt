I. I regret that I am unable to agree with any of the three points in the
operative part of the Judgment as I see the whole case from a different
viewpoint to that of the Court.


2. The crux of the case before us is simple in that, to use the expression
used by Libya in its Application, the United States “continues to adopt a
posture of pressuring Libya into surrendering the accused” and “is rather
intent on compelling the surrender of the accused”.

The United States and Libya have adopted different positions concern-
ing the surrender (transfer) of the two Libyans who are accused of the
destruction of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie and who are located in
Libya. Those differing positions of the applicant State and the respon-
dent State did not, however, constitute a “dispute . . . concerning the
interpretation or application of the [1971 Montreal] Convention” to
which both are parties (Montreal Convention, Art. 14, para. 1).

It is my firm belief that the Application by which, on 3 March 1992,
Libya instituted proceedings against the United States pursuant to Ar-
ticle 14, paragraph 1, of the Montreal Convention should be dismissed
on the sole ground that the dispute, if one exists, between the two States
- is not one that “concern[s] the interpretation or application of the
[Montreal] Convention”.

B. The Relevant Issues of International Law

The issues in the present case

15. There is no doubt that the 1971 Montreal Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation is, in
general, applicable to the destruction of the American Pan Am aircraft
which occurred in December 1988 over Lockerbie in the United King-
dom, as long as both Libya and the United States are parties to it.


178 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (DISS. OP. ODA)

Neither Party seems ever to have doubted that that destruction consti-
tuted a “crime” under the 1971 Convention. That point, however, is not
in issue between the two States; nor is the prevention of international
terrorism at issue in this case since proceedings were brought by Libya
and not by the United States.

Furthermore, the question of whether the United States can hold
Libya, as a State, responsible for the acts of Libyan nationals relating to
the destruction of the American Pan Am aircraft over United Kingdom
territory and of whether the explosion was caused by alleged Libyan
intelligence agents (which would make Libya responsible for the acts
committed by such persons), were not at issue either in the present Appli-
cation which was instituted by Libya and not by the United States.

16. It would be wrong to consider that the present Application con-
cerns the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 or, more generally, the
Lockerbie incident as a whole which constituted an act of international
terrorism. An application of that nature could have been filed by the
United States but not by Libya.

The issues in the present case submitted by Libya to the Court relate
solely to the demand of the Respondent, the United States, that the
Applicant, Libya, surrender the two suspects identified by the indictment
of the Grand Jury in the District of Columbia as having caused the
destruction of the Pan Am aircraft (clearly a crime pursuant to the
Montreal Convention) and Libya’s refusal to accede to the Respondent’s
demand. Relations between those two States regarding the case went no
further than this.

Criminal jurisdiction

17. No State is prevented from exercising its criminal jurisdiction over
a person or persons who have committed a crime on its territory, or a
person or persons who have committed serious damage to its interest or
against it nationals, or who have committed a crime of universal jurisdic-
tion anywhere in the world. Accordingly, there is no doubt that in this
case the United States is competent to exercise its criminal jurisdiction
over the two suspects, whoever they may be and wherever they may be
located.

Conversely, nor is there any doubt that any State is entitled to exercise
its criminal jurisdiction over a serious crime committed by its nationals
anywhere, either on its own territory or abroad. Libya’s rights in this
respect do not seem to have been challenged by the United States.

18. Thus, the right to prosecute or punish criminals does not fall
within the exclusive jurisdiction of any particular State, either the State
whose interest has been damaged (in this instance, the United States) or


179 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (DISS. OP. ODA)

the State of which the criminal is a national (in this instance, Libya). The
Libyan suspects in this case are subject to the concurrent jurisdictions of
either the State where they have committed the crime or of the State
where they are located. The Montreal Convention adds nothing to this
general principle and does not deviate at all from it.

There is no difference in the views of the Applicant and the Respon-
dent regarding the interpretation of those general rules of international
law. There exists, apparently, no dispute in this respect.

19. The issues in this case arose not in relation to a legal question gov-
erning the rights and obligations of either Party to prosecute or punish
the two suspects but are related rather to the fact that while the United
States demanded that Libya transfer or surrender the two suspects located
on its territory with a view to achieving criminal justice, Libya refused to
accede to that demand, and, accordingly, the suspects have (so far)
avoided the criminal jurisdiction of the United States.

Law of extradition

20. States have not been under an obligation to extradite accused per-
sons under general international law but some specific treaties, either
multilateral or bilateral, have imposed the obligation on contracting
States to extradite accused persons to other contracting States. The
Montreal Convention is certainly one of those treaties.

An exception to that obligation to extradite criminals is made, how-
ever, in the event that the accused are of the nationality of the State
which is requested to extradite them. This rule of non-extradition of
nationals of the requested State may not seem to be quite appropriate for
the purposes of criminal justice, as the accused may more adequately be
prosecuted in the country where the actual crime occurred. While no rule
of international law prohibits extradition of nationals of the requested
State, there is a long-standing international practice which recognizes
that there is no obligation to extradite one’s own. nationals. The
Montreal Convention is no exception as it does not provide for the extra-
dition of nationals of the requested State even for the punishment of these
universally recognized unlawful acts.

The rule of non-extradition of political criminals has long prevailed
but that rule does not apply in the case of some universal crimes, such as
genocide and acts of terrorism.

21. The Montreal Convention, however, goes one step further in the
event that States do not extradite the accused to other competent States,
by imposing the duty upon the State where the accused is located to bring
the case before its own competent authorities for prosecution. Under the
Montreal Convention, Libya would thus assume the responsibility to
prosecute the accused if it did not extradite them. Libya has not chal-
lenged this point at all. Libya has claimed that it was proceeding to the
prosecution of the suspects and it has also expressed its willingness to
extradite them to what it maintains are certain politically neutral States.

C. Conclusion

22. Thus conceived, the question relating to the United States’ demand
that Libya surrender the two suspects and Libya’s refusal to accede to
that demand is not a matter of rights or legal obligation concerning the
extradition of accused persons between the United States and Libya
under international law nor is it a matter falling within the provisions of
the Montreal Convention. Or, at least, there is no legal dispute concern-
ing the interpretation or application of the Montreal Convention between
Libya and the United States which could have been brought to arbitra-
tion or to the Court.

If there is any difference between them on this matter, that could
simply be a difference between their respective policies towards criminal
justice in connection with the question of which State should properly
do justice on the matter. That issue does not fall within the ambit of
the Montreal Convention.

From the outset, no dispute has existed between Libya and the United
States “concerning the interpretation or application of the [Montreal]
Convention” as far as the demand for the surrender of the suspects and
the refusal to accede to that demand — the main issue in the present case
— are concerned. Libya neither presented any argument contrary to that
viewpoint nor proved the existence of such a legal dispute.

II. THE QUESTION OF ADMISSIBILITY — THE EFFECT
OF THE SECURITY CoUNCIL RESOLUTIONS

24. As I have stated abeve, I am firmly of the view that the Court
lacks the jurisdiction to consider this Application filed by Libya. If the
Court’s jurisdiction is denied, as I believe it should be, the issue of
whether the Application is or is not admissible does not arise. For me, at
least, it is meaningless to discuss the question of admissibility. However,
the Court, after it

“finds that it has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 14, paragraph 1,
of the Montreal Convention . . . to hear the disputes between
Libya and the United States as to the interpretation or application
of the provisions of that Convention” (Judgment, operative para-
graph 53 (1) (b)),
continues to deal with the question of admissibility and finds that
“the Application filed by Libya . . . is admissible” (para. 53 (2) (b))

43. Even though I found that Libya’s Application should be dismissed
owing to the Court’s lack of jurisdiction, I nonetheless wanted to express
my view that these Security Council resolutions, which have a political
connotation in dealing with broader aspects of threats to the peace or
breaches of the peace, have nothing to do with the present case, which,
had there been jurisdiction, could have been submitted to the Court as
a legal issue which existed between the United States and Libya, and
between the United Kingdom and Libya, before the resolutions were
adopted by the Security Council.
