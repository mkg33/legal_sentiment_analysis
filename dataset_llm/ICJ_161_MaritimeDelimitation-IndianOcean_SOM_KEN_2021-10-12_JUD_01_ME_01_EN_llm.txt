                         Reasons for vote in favour of subparagraph (5) of the dispositive paragraph of
                      the Judgment — Both Parties consider that the Court has sufficient information to
                      delimit the outer continental shelf — However, Court has scant evidence regarding
                      any outer continental shelf — Methodology that achieves an equitable delimitation
                      of the 200‑nautical‑mile zones does not necessarily result in equitable delimitation
                      of the outer continental shelf.

                         1. I have voted in favour of subparagraph (5) of the dispositive para-
                      graph of the Judgment, pursuant to which the maritime boundary contin-
                      ues beyond 200 nautical miles until it reaches the outer limits of the
                      continental shelf or the area where the rights of third States may be
                      affected. I submit this opinion in order to indicate the reasons why I have
                      cast this vote and why I do so with reluctance.

                         2. As the Court notes, both Parties have asked the Court to delimit the
                      continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which
                      the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (the “outer continental shelf”).
                      Each Party has proposed that the Court do so by extending the boundary
                      line that it proposes — an equidistance line on the part of Somalia and the
                      parallel of latitude on the part of Kenya. The Court can reasonably assume
                      that each Party has called upon the Court to delimit the outer continental
                      shelf in full awareness of the fact that a maritime boundary established by
                      the Court need not follow the course proposed by a party.
                         3. Each Party also has a comprehensive appreciation of the strength,
                      and potential weaknesses, of its own submission to the Commission on the
                      Limits of the Continental Shelf (the “CLCS” or “the Commission”).
                      ­Neither Party has questioned the other Party’s entitlement to outer contin­
                       ental shelf or the other Party’s claim that, in certain parts of the area
                       in which the Parties’ claims overlap, such entitlement extends to the
                       350-­nautical‑mile constraint set out in Article 76, paragraph 5, of the United
                       Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”). All indications,
                       therefore, are that both Parties consider that the Court has sufficient infor-
                       mation to arrive at an equitable delimitation of the outer continental
                       shelf. It is on this basis that I have reached the conclusion that the Court
                       should delimit the outer continental shelf in this case.

                        4. My hesitancy about the Court’s decision to delimit the outer conti-
                      nental shelf in this case stems from the fact that the Court has scant evi-
                      dence regarding the existence, shape, extent and continuity of any outer
                      continental shelf that might appertain to the Parties. The Court is not

                           5. For avoidance of doubt, I note that my misgivings about the Court’s
                       decision to delimit the outer continental shelf are not animated by proce-
                       dural concerns. The fact that the CLCS has not yet made a recommenda-
                       tion relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf of either State is
                       not in itself an obstacle to equitable delimitation of the outer continental
                       shelf.
                           6. This case is entirely different from other cases in which a tribunal
                       has delimited the outer continental shelf of two States. In Delimitation of
                       the Maritime Boundary in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar), the
                       International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (“ITLOS”) noted that there
                       was “uncontested scientific evidence” that “practically the entire floor of
                       the Bay of Bengal, including areas appertaining to [both Parties]”, was
                       covered with a “thick layer of sedimentary rocks” (Delimitation of the
                       Maritime Boundary in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar),
                      ­Judgment, ITLOS Reports 2012, p. 115, paras. 445-446). The Annex VII
                       ­Tribunal in the Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary Arbitration between
                       Bangladesh and India took note of the reasoning of ITLOS and of
                       the maritime delimitation between Bangladesh and Myanmar and
                        ­concluded that both Bangladesh and India had entitlements to outer con-
                       tinental shelf (Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary Arbitration (Bangla‑
                       desh v. India), Award of 7 July 2014, Reports of International Arbitral
                       Awards, Vol. XXXII, p. 138, paras. 457‑458).


                         7. In Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire, the Special Chamber of ITLOS had the ben-
                      efit of an affirmative CLCS recommendation in relation to Ghana. It
                      observed that the geological situation of Côte d’Ivoire was “identical” to
                      that of Ghana (Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Atlantic
                      Ocean (Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire), Judgment, ITLOS Reports 2017, p. 136,
                      para. 491).
                         8. In the present case, the Court has no comparable evidence regarding
                      the existence, extent, shape or continuity of any outer continental shelf
                      appertaining to either Party. The Parties submitted to the Court the exec-
                      utive summaries of their submissions to the Commission (although not
                      the submissions themselves). Submissions by States to the CLCS are uni-
                      lateral assertions made with a view towards maximizing the area of con-
                      tinental shelf that the State can claim. It cannot be assumed that the
                      Commission will adopt any State’s submission.

                         9. My doubts about the Court’s decision to delimit the outer continen-
                      tal shelf do not result from the particular course of the boundary that the
                      Court has established. The lack of information about any area of over-
                      lapping entitlement would be of concern whether that delimitation had
                      proceeded along the parallel of latitude, as Kenya proposed, along an

                      equidistance line, as Somalia proposed, or along the adjusted equidis-

                         10. I also offer a brief observation about the methodology that is
                      appropriate to the delimitation of the outer continental shelf.
                         11. In relation to delimitation of the 200-nautical‑mile zones, the key
                      determinant of an equitable delimitation is normally the coastal configu-
                      ration of the two States (represented by base points when an equidistance
                      methodology is applied). The area of overlapping entitlement is identified
                      on the basis of the projection in the seaward direction of each party’s
                      relevant coast, i.e. “the coast [of each Party] . . . [that] generate[s] projec-
                      tions which overlap with projections from the coast of the other Party”
                      (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine), Judgment,
                      I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 97, para. 99). An equidistance line, constructed
                      using base points on the parties’ coasts, provides an initial indication of
                      an equitable apportionment of the area of overlap, to be adjusted if spe-
                      cial and/or relevant circumstances so warrant.

                         12. Beyond 200 nautical miles from the coasts of two adjacent States,
                      on the other hand, any area of overlapping entitlement is not determined
                      by the configuration of the coasts of the two States, but rather by applica-
                      tion of the geomorphological and geological criteria set out in Article 76
                      of UNCLOS. Coastal configuration only becomes relevant to a State’s
                      entitlement to outer continental shelf if it has been established (on the
                      basis of the criteria set out in Article 76, paragraph 4, of UNCLOS) that
                      the outer edge of a State’s continental margin extends so far as to reach a
                      distance of 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth
                      of its territorial sea is measured, where the State’s entitlement is limited
                      by the 350-nautical‑mile constraint contained in Article 76, paragraph 5,
                      of UNCLOS.
                         13. In delimitation between two adjacent States, it is simple (and there-
                      fore inviting) to continue a delimitation line past the 200-nautical‑mile
                      limit, using a directional arrow. However, because the juridical basis for
                      entitlement to outer continental shelf is entirely different from the basis
                      for entitlement within 200 nautical miles, it cannot be presumed that a
                      line that achieves an equitable delimitation of the 200-nautical‑mile zones
                      will also result in equitable delimitation of overlapping areas of two
                      States’ outer continental shelf.
