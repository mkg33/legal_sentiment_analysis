       1. I agree with the Court’s determination that Bank Markazi cannot be considered a “company”
under the Treaty of Amity (hereinafter the “Treaty”), and with the ultimate conclusion that the
defence of “unclean hands” cannot be upheld in this case. I also agree that the defence under
Article XX (1) (c) cannot be upheld, although I reach that conclusion on the ground that the
challenged United States measures were not enacted for the purpose of regulating the production or
trafficking of items “for the purpose of supplying a military establishment” 1. I also agree with the
Court’s partial dismissal of Iran’s claim under Article IV (2), as I believe that the term “most constant
protection and security” only requires physical and not legal protection or security, and with the
Court’s rejection of Iran’s claims under Articles V (1) and VII (1).


      2. On the other hand, I believe the Court erred in denying the United States’ objection based
on exhaustion of local remedies and its defences based on abuse of rights and Article XX (1) (d), as
well as its resolution of Iran’s claims under Articles III (1), IV (1), IV (2) (as regards expropriation)
and X (1). Accordingly, I dissent as to these issues for the reasons discussed below 2.

                                                 A. Abuse of rights

      3. I agree with the Court that, although the United States’ defence of abuse of rights raises
substantially “similar” arguments to those it made in its preliminary objections, the Court’s
2019 Judgment 3 does not preclude the United States from invoking an abuse of rights defence on the
merits (see paragraph 88 of the present Judgment). I disagree, however, with the Court’s finding that
the United States has failed to demonstrate that Iran now seeks to exercise its rights under the Treaty
for purposes other than those for which the rights at issue were established to the detriment of the
United States.


       4. In its present Judgment, the Court finds that it

       “could only accept the abuse of rights defence . . . if it were demonstrated by the
       Respondent, on the basis of compelling evidence, that the Applicant seeks to exercise
       rights conferred on it by the Treaty of Amity for purposes other than those for which
       the rights at issue were established, and that it was doing so to the detriment of the
       Respondent” 4.

I believe that this is precisely what the United States has demonstrated. Concluding that Iran is
seeking to exercise rights under the Treaty for the purpose for which they were created is inconsistent
with the facts of this case. As described below, the underlying circumstances of this case are so far
removed from the object, purpose, context and provisions of the Treaty that Iran’s attempt to rely on
and apply the Treaty to these circumstances constitutes an abuse of rights.

       5. The Treaty’s preamble clearly states that its purpose is to “encourag[e] mutually beneficial
trade and investments and closer economic intercourse generally between their peoples, and [to]
regulat[e] consular relations” 5. Accepting this purpose, the Court has expressly noted that the object
and purpose of the Treaty are not to “regulate peaceful and friendly relations between the two States
in a general sense” 6, but to address “rules providing for freedom of trade and commerce” 7.


       6. However, none of the United States’ measures concern the preamble’s stated purpose of
“encouraging mutually beneficial trade and investments and closer economic intercourse generally
between their peoples, and of regulating consular relations”. The statutes in question were not
concerned with giving advantages to American businesses, or stimulating foreign investments, or
increasing trade between the two countries, or opening markets to successful industries, or adding
jobs. Their one and only purpose was to assist United States citizens in recovering money damages
as a result of injuries and deaths caused by terrorist acts proven in United States courts to have been
perpetrated or sponsored by Iran, which Iran refused to pay. The United States did not act for reasons

                                         B. Exhaustion of local remedies

       8. I first note that the Iranian companies that were given the opportunity to be heard in
United States lawsuits seeking attachment of assets did not in any way respond to those lawsuits 10 or
otherwise respond in United States courts. It is unreasonable to say that the companies in question
“had no reasonable possibility of successfully asserting their rights in United States court
proceedings” 11 when they did not even attempt to do so, and the record indicates that others had
prevailed on factually similar claims. Thus, Iran cannot present a claim here in respect of those
companies that did not exhaust all local remedies. The Court concludes, however, that exhaustion is
not necessary based on Article 15 (a) of the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) 2006 Draft
Articles on Diplomatic Protection. Article 15 (a) provides an exception to the requirement of
exhaustion if an injured party had no reasonable possibility of obtaining redress 12. I believe the Court
misunderstands the law of the United States and erroneously applies the Article 15 (a) exception to
reach an incorrect conclusion on this issue.



        8 These acts encompassed attacks against American, French, British, Swiss, German, Israeli and Argentine citizens.

Specifically, these acts included suicide attacks on the United States’ embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including
17 Americans, and the bombing of United States Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 United States
Marines and injuring many others. A simultaneous attack killed 58 French soldiers in a neighbouring location. The results
of investigations are summarized in the evidence presented to United States courts, including testimony from experts who
studied Iran; senior officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence personnel; and fact witnesses who were
either Iranian officials or actual participants in the terrorist attacks and testified that Iran was responsible for the acts
committed by Hezbollah and Hamas. The United States submitted statements from Iranian officials and six participants in
the Khobar Towers bombing, implicating Iran as having organized, funded, and supported the attack. See e.g. Peterson v.
Islamic Republic of Iran, 264 F. Supp. 2d 46 (D.D.C. 2003); Holland v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 496 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C.
2005); Blais v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 459 F. Supp. 2d 40 (D.D.C. 2006); Heiser v. Islamic Republican of Iran, 466 F.
Supp. 2d 229 (D.D.C. 2006). The United States also referenced the testimony obtained under oath by French investigators
of individuals implicated in the assassination of an American citizen. This testimony was to the effect that the then Iranian
Minister of Intelligence and Head of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, Ayatollah Fallahian, was involved in
ordering the killings of Iranian dissidents in Paris. Elahi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 124 F. Supp. 2d 97 (D.D.C. 2000).
Much other direct testimony of Iran’s responsibility for the terrorist attacks can be found in the various opinions of United
States courts submitted by the parties in those cases. Iran never contested this evidence in United States courts.

       9. The Court says that because later-enacted statutes such as the measures at issue here, take
precedence over conflicting provisions of earlier-enacted treaties under United States law, Iranian
companies had no reasonable possibility of obtaining redress from United States courts based on the
provisions of the Treaty 13. The first problem with this holding is the underlying and unwarranted
assumption that Iranian companies had to be able to prevail in United States courts specifically under
the provisions of the Treaty rather than under United States law. But there is no support for the
Court’s apparent requirement that, under Article 15 (a), Iran must have been able to prevail on its
claim under the Treaty alone, rather than on any other basis 14. International law, as reflected in
Article 15 (a), does not say the exception applies only where a specific remedy is unavailable. Rather,
its language is far broader, providing an exception only where redress is impossible. That scenario is
clearly inapplicable to Iranian companies here, where other Iranian parties had previously prevailed
in United States courts under the very same factual circumstances.


       10. For example, in Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, the claimants argued that they were
entitled to attach property of Iran in the possession of the University of Chicago pursuant to the same
United States measures at issue here. The district court agreed with Iran that the property in question
was not subject to attachment and execution based on the court’s interpretation of the relevant
statutes. Notwithstanding this perfect example where Iran prevailed in United States courts, this
Court, without explanation or support, nevertheless dismisses the relevance of Rubin because the
district court’s decision was based on United States law rather than on the provisions of the Treaty 15.
As noted, there is no support for the proposition that Article 15 (a) requires that a company must be
able to prevail on a particular theory.


      11. Additionally, the Court should not conflate  as it does here  the legitimate
consideration and failure of a specific claim with the impossibility of redress 16. The Court cites to
the examples in the commentary wherein the Article 15 (a) exception might apply 17, but completely
ignores the most relevant part of the commentary, which notes in no uncertain terms that proving the
exception imposes a “heavy burden” and explains that,

        “[i]n order to meet the requirements of paragraph [15] (a), it is not sufficient for the
        injured person to show that the possibility of success is low or that further appeals are
        difficult or costly. The test is not whether a successful outcome is likely or possible, but
        whether the municipal system of the respondent State is reasonably capable of
        providing effective relief.” 18

Islamic Republic of Iran, 76 F. Supp. 2d 16 (D.D.C. 1999); Hegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2003 WL 25952462
(N.D. Ill. 2003).
        16 Judgment, para. 72.

        17 Of the examples listed in the commentary, only one is relevant to this case. See ILC, Draft Articles on Diplomatic

Protection with Commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2006, Vol. II, Part Two, p. 47 (“[T]he local
court has no jurisdiction over the dispute in question; the national legislation justifying the acts of which the alien complains
will not be reviewed by local courts; the local courts are notoriously lacking in independence; there is a consistent and
well-established line of precedents adverse to the alien; the local courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate
and adequate remedy to the alien; or the respondent State does not have an adequate system of judicial protection.”). Only
the reference to the existence of “a consistent and well-established line of precedents adverse to the alien” has any possible
relevance here.

Notwithstanding the caution of the commentary, this Court improperly bases its conclusion on the
possibility that success might be low or unlikely, rather than on whether the municipal legal system
of the United States is reasonably capable of providing effective relief.

relief, a court would have to be certain that no alternative outcome could be reached, which could
only be achieved after analysing the nature of the claim and all possible defences available to the
parties. Certainly, that has not occurred here.


       15. In short, the principle of United States law providing that the latest in time between a
statute and a treaty prevails has no application here. Moreover, a fair reading of the totality of the
commentary of the exception in Article 15 (a) indicates that it is meant to apply to an entire judicial

that the Peterson litigation involved the question of a conflict between 28 U.S.C. §8772 and the Treaty. §8772 is no longer

and V of the Treaty to the extent they concern Bank Markazi.

system and not to the result of a few cases 25. To conclude that there is no possibility of redress for
Iranian companies in the United States based on the result of a few cases in which Iranian companies
did not even appear to defend themselves (despite the success other Iranian companies had enjoyed
before United States courts 26) is, in my view, an erroneous reading of Article 15 (a).


      16. Ultimately, the record indicates that Iranian companies have exhausted local remedies in
only two cases, Bennett and Weinstein, in which only Banks Melli, Saderat and Sepah were
involved 27. Those cases were considered by United States district and appeals courts, before being
appealed to the Supreme Court, but denied certiorari. For that reason, all claims relating to the
remaining cases, in which local remedies were not exhausted, should be dismissed as inadmissible.


                                                 C. Article XX (1) (d)

       17. I agree with the Court that the defence regarding Article XX (1) (c) is unavailing, albeit on
a different basis. However, the resolution of the Article XX (1) (d) issue is a different matter. There,
the Court finds that “it was for the United States to show that Executive Order 13599 was a measure
necessary to protect its essential security interests, and that it has not convincingly demonstrated that
this was so” 28. The Court bases its conclusion only on its view that Executive Order (“EO”) 13599
focuses on financial matters rather than matters of national security29. The problem with the Court’s
decision is that it has considered EO 13599 in a vacuum as a stand-alone measure, without
considering the totality of the evidence and arguments presented by the United States.


       18. First, the Court ignores the opening sentence of EO 13599, which specifically references
and incorporates a prior executive order 30, the historical purpose of which was to enact measures
“necessary to protect [the United States’] essential security interests”. These measures begin with
EO 12957 in 1995, which was enacted “in response to the actions and policies of the Government of
Iran, including support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace
process, and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them” 31. In
2001, EO 13224 blocked property of and prohibited transactions with persons who commit, threaten
to commit or support terrorism. In 2005, EO 13382 blocked the property of those who engage in or
support the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Thus, while these
EOs may have had an impact on the financial sector, their purpose was firmly and explicitly rooted
in ensuring United States national security, and, as EO 13599 itself states, it constituted an




        25 See  e.g. Chittharanjan F. Amerasinghe, Diplomatic Protection, pp. 153-154 (domestic courts lacking
jurisdiction); Gerald Fitzmaurice, The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice, p. 692 (domestic judiciary
notoriously under the influence of the executive).
         26 See e.g. Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1003 (N.D. Ill., 2014); Ministry of Defense and Support

of Iran, 515 F. Supp. 2d 25, 44-45 (D.D.C. 2007) (some family members of the Marines and other servicemen who were
killed in the 1983 terrorist bombing were barred from asserting intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, because
they lacked standing under the applicable state tort law).
         27 While Bank Markazi did litigate the constitutional separation of powers issue to the Supreme Court in the

Peterson case, it has not exhausted all remedies, as the case was remanded to the district court. In addition, Bank Markazi
is not a “company” within the meaning of the Treaty, as held by this Court.

      22. Although, as noted above, I do not believe that the Treaty applies to the challenged
United States measures, I nevertheless address the Court’s decision with regard to specific articles
below.


                                                A. Article III (1)

        23. The Court conflates its analysis of Articles III (1) and IV (1). It finds that because the
challenged United States measures violated Article IV (1) as “manifestly excessive” and thus
“unreasonable”, they automatically “also” violated Article III (1) 35. But neither the language nor the
context of Article III supports this conclusion. Article III (1) only calls for a simple recognition of
juridical status, that is, legal existence enabling Iranian companies to operate within the territory of
the United States. Why exactly unreasonableness is equated to non-recognition of juridical status is
left entirely unexplained. And whether a measure is manifestly excessive has no bearing on whether
its juridical status has been recognized.

      24. Moreover, examining these claims under the rubric of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties requires first that the Court should accord the terms of a treaty their ordinary meaning.

                                                          -8-

The plain meaning of Article III (1), as noted above, suggests a simple acknowledgment that the
juridical status of “companies” be recognized, without implicating additional legal rights. This is
made clear by the provision’s explicit limitation that “recognition of juridical status does not of itself
confer rights upon companies to engage in the activities for which they are organized”. Although the
majority mentions this explicit limitation as part of the language of Article III (1), it treats that
passage as inconsequential 36. Moreover, the Court ignores the Treaty’s negotiating history, to which
we must turn in the absence of a definition in the Treaty itself. As noted by the United States on the
second day of the hearing on 21 September 2022, the instructions to United States State Department
negotiators at the time explained that Article III (1) “merely provides their [i.e. Iranian companies’]
recognition as corporate entities principally in order [that] they may prosecute or defend their rights
in court as corporate entities”. The instructions continue to state: “Corporate status should be
recognized [to] assure [the] right [of] foreign corporate entities . . . [to] free access [to] courts [to]
collect debts, protect patent rights, enforce contracts, etc.” 37. Throughout, the United States has taken
the position that the provision in Article III (1) requires each country to simply acknowledge that a
corporation is existent and endowed with legal being.


       25. These communications, which Iran did not challenge, were unambiguous and contradict
any alleged requirement that Iranian companies be treated in all cases as entities separate from the
Iranian state. Accordingly, they do not preclude the piercing of the corporate veil of these companies
to reach assets of Iranian-owned companies.


       26. The Court finds in regard to Article IV (1) that,

       “[i]n the present case, the rights of Iranian companies to appear before the courts in the
       United States, to make legal submissions and to lodge appeals, have not been curtailed.
       The enactment of legislative provisions removing legal defences based on separate legal
       personality, and their application by the courts, do not in themselves constitute a serious
       failure in the administration of justice amounting to a denial of justice.” 38

In other words, United States courts recognized the juridical status of Iranian companies, and they
participated freely in the United States’ legal process. Yet, the Court finds — without support and in
direct contradiction of its earlier statement that the requirement to recognize juridical status is not
absolute — that recognition of juridical status means that Iranian companies must absolutely be
treated as separate and independent legal entities, thereby precluding the ability of the United States
to pierce the corporate veil in the interests of justice 39. Nowhere does Article III (1) require the
recognition of the companies’ legal “separateness”, and this alleged requirement, which was a critical
point in dispute between the Parties, is neither explained by the majority nor supported by the
language of Article III (1) or its negotiating history.


       27. Because I believe the majority errs in failing to adequately consider the defences posed to
an alleged breach of Article III (1), as well as in its conclusion with respect to Article III (1), I dissent.

      28. In addition to disagreeing with the Court’s erroneous conflation of Articles III (1) and
IV (1), I also disagree with the Court’s holding that the United States breached Article IV (1).


        29. The Court finds that Article IV (1) is comprised of three distinct obligations and discusses
the first two. The first obligation requires each State to treat the Parties fairly and equitably, including
protection against the denial of justice, which the Court correctly finds did not occur here 40. The
second obligation prohibits the application of “unreasonable or discriminatory measures”. Here, the
majority finds the United States measures “unreasonable” and does not address whether the measures
were discriminatory.


       30. The Court’s finding that the United States measures were unreasonable is both convoluted
and, I believe, incorrect. First, the Court says that “unreasonable” means “lacking in justification
based on rational grounds” 41. It then adds that “a measure is unreasonable within the meaning of the
Treaty of Amity if it does not meet certain conditions” 42. A measure is thus unreasonable where it
(1) does not have “a legitimate public purpose”; (2) does not contain an “appropriate relationship
between the purpose pursued and the measure adopted”; or (3) has an “adverse impact [that] is
manifestly excessive in relation to the purpose pursued” 43.


       31. The Court’s treatment of “reasonableness” ultimately focuses exclusively on the third
condition of its definition, finding that the alleged adverse impact of the United States measures was
manifestly excessive in relation to the protection afforded to the purposes invoked and, consequently,
unreasonable 44. Presumably, the allegedly adverse impact of the measures was the attachment of
assets that were in the possession of companies entirely or majority owned by Iran (the United States
legislation in question applies only to companies in which Iran has full or a majority ownership),
while the “purpose pursued” by the United States was enabling compensation for victims of terrorist
acts. But the Court does not consider this purpose or explain why measures invoked for such a
legitimate purpose were “manifestly excessive” in relation to the impact on Iranian companies that
were wholly or primarily owned by Iran.


       32. The catalysts for the United States measures were cases involving more than
1,300 individuals who were victims or family members of victims who had won legitimate judgments
in separate cases against Iran for its role in several severe bombing incidents, including the
1983 Beirut barracks bombings and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, as well as in assassinations
and kidnappings 45. The Court does not answer the question of why discouraging or impeding these
terrorist bombings, murders or kidnappings is manifestly excessive compared to the attachment of
assets held by companies wholly or majority owned by Iran. The Court’s failure to engage in any
comparison at all between the United States’ reasons for implementing the challenged measures and
their impact on Iran and Iranian companies is itself unreasonable.

or in investment protection treaties, but certain international tribunals have attempted to give more
specific content to the term. The prevailing view is that no matter what the exact definition, the term
creates a high threshold. In Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of
Colombia, for example, the tribunal held by majority with respect to the term “unreasonable or
discriminatory measures” in Article 4 (1) of the Colombia-Switzerland bilateral investment treaty
that the threshold for showing that a measure is unreasonable is a high one 46. It then added:

              “Investment arbitration tribunals are not called to adjudicate appeals against
       measures adopted by States or their agencies. Their task is to establish whether the
       state’s conduct vis-à-vis protected foreign investors is tainted by prejudice, preference
       or bias or is so totally incompatible with reason that it constitutes an international
       wrong.” 47

The Court, without any explanation or support, simply chooses a much lower threshold.


       34. Finally, it is incorrect to say that both the FSIA and TRIA “employ very broad terms,
which are capable of encompassing any legal entity, regardless of Iran’s type or degree of control
over them” 48. Rather, these statutes apply to a specific subset of companies and are tailored precisely.
Section 201 of TRIA, for example, applies explicitly to “agencies and instrumentalities” of a terrorist
party. The reference in the statute to “agencies and instrumentalities” is not an open-ended provision
applying to any agency or company within a State’s jurisdiction, but is qualified by the phrase “of
that terrorist party” and, most importantly, the fact that, by specific legislative definition (as
explained further below), an entity must be owned in whole or in the majority by Iran in order to
qualify as an agency or instrumentality of Iran.


       35. In this connection, the majority also ignores or overlooks relevant provisions of the FSIA
that limit its scope, including Section 1603 (b), which defines “agency or instrumentality of a foreign
state” as any entity “which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority
of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision
thereof”. In the specific context of collecting a liability judgment against a State-sponsor of terrorism,
enforcing that judgment against the assets of an agency or instrumentality, thus defined, is justified
through the accepted doctrine of piercing the corporate veil. In addition, Section 1610 (g) (3)
provides that, for third-party joint property holders,

       “[n]othing in this subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority of a court to
       prevent appropriately the impairment of an interest held by a person who is not liable in
       the action giving rise to a judgment in property subject to attachment in aid of execution,
       or execution, upon such judgment”.

In other words, United States courts had the authority to prevent the impairment of interests held by
Iranian companies not liable in a given action, that is, an Iranian company that is owned in whole or
in the majority by a third party, or that is not an agency or instrumentality of Iran. Among other
defences, Iranian companies could have sought such protection of available rights. These companies
should not now be rewarded for their failure to appear in the enforcement proceedings brought
against them, or for their failure to raise defences and exhaust local remedies.

      36. For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.


      37. While I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the most constant security and protection
provision in Article IV (2) only requires physical and not legal protection and security, I disagree
with its finding that the challenged executive, legislative or judicial acts in question constitute a
taking, and are thereby expropriatory.


       38. It is extremely difficult to see how attachment to obtain satisfaction of a money judgment,
lawfully obtained, can amount to an expropriation. The Court’s observation that it is not “disputed
that the Iranian companies concerned did not receive any payment” 49, encapsulates the difficulty of
finding expropriation in this case. Iran has never disputed in United States courts that it owed the
money in question by virtue of liability judgments. Nor has it disputed, in the present proceedings,
that the United States liability judgments created a debt. If the money was owed, it seems absurd to
require the United States Government to pay it back. In that case, the United States would simply be
compensating the victims itself for wrongs for which Iran is responsible. The money that was in the
possession of the agencies and instrumentalities of Iran was essentially Iran’s money. Assets that
were attached in legal proceedings exclusively against companies wholly or majority owned by Iran
to pay Iran’s undisputed debt cannot constitute a taking by the State. Moreover, the effect of paying
a judgment debt is economically neutral and legally required, not expropriatory 50.


       39. The Court correctly states in relation to judicial decisions ordering the attachment and
execution of property that these do not by themselves amount to expropriations. It then says that a
judicial decision does amount to an expropriation if it applies legislative or executive measures that
infringe international law and thereby causes a deprivation of property51. I find no support for such
a stark and extraordinarily broad pronouncement that recasts the notion of judicial expropriation.
Recall that, in the Court’s own view, the rights of Iranian companies to appear before United States
courts and make submissions or lodge appeals had not been curtailed. It also found specifically that
enacting legislative provisions removing legal defences, and the United States courts’ application of
these provisions, did not in themselves constitute a failure in the administration of justice amounting
to a denial of justice 52. Considering that there was also no violation of due process in these domestic
proceedings, it is difficult to accept that a violation of international law occurred in this regard, even
if the Court’s unusual and expansive definition of judicial expropriation were to be acceptable.


      40. Again, the only rationale offered by the majority to demonstrate a violation of international
law is that it has found, in relation to Iran’s Article IV (1) claim, that the United States measures
were unreasonable 53. How can the concept of unreasonableness, which appears only in that one
provision, be read into two additional, yet totally different contexts? The Court applies
unreasonableness, easily the most nebulous of the three standards under Article IV (1), to thereby
find breaches of Article III (1) and now also Article IV (2). I cannot imagine that the parties to the
Treaty would have intended for the entirely imprecise concept of “unreasonableness” to have such


                                                   D. Article X (1)

      44. While I agree with the Court’s finding that “commerce” in this provision is not limited to
maritime commerce or to trade in goods and associated transactions 55, I disagree with the Court’s
holding that the United States measures limited Iranian companies’ freedom of commerce and
navigation.


       45. Article X (1) and the obligations it establishes are general and lack specificity. In its
2019 Judgment, in the context of its discussion concerning sovereign immunity, the Court confirmed
its holding in Oil Platforms that the term referred to “commercial exchanges in general” and was
“not limited to the mere acts of purchase and sale”56. Nonetheless, the Court added that “even if
understood in this sense, freedom of commerce cannot cover matters that have no connection, or too
tenuous a connection, with the commercial relations between the States Parties to the Treaty” 57.


       46. But this is precisely what the United States’ measures cover. They cover matters “that have
no connection, or too tenuous a connection, with the commercial relations between the State Parties
to the Treaty”. While a blocking order, the enforcement of a judgment, or a measure of constraint
could conceivably have an effect on commerce, any government measure could if that approach is
taken be regarded as having such an effect. I find it impossible to read Article X (1) as prohibiting

any such measure whatsoever, and an interpretation that would result in a nearly limitless
interpretation of the phrase “freedom of commerce” is not logical. I find no correlation between the
United States’ measures and Article X (1), and no textual support for the view that the Parties
intended to prohibit the payment of any judgment debt when they entered into the Treaty.
“Commerce” has many features, and one of these features is commercial disputes. Litigation between
commercial parties results in the creation of judgment debts with frequency. To say that this core
aspect of commerce is prohibited under the Treaty on the basis that it impedes freedom of
commerce  the very thing of which it forms part  is ironic.


       47. More generally, the majority’s conclusion that commerce existed between the territories
of the two Parties strikes me as peculiar for two reasons. First, in Oil Platforms, the Court referred
to the “important territorial limitation” in Article X (1), stating that “[i]n order to enjoy the protection
provided by that text, the commerce or the navigation is to be between the territories of the
United States and Iran” 58. Here, it is not clear that any affected “commerce” was “between the
territories” of the two Parties, as all transactions occurred via intermediaries based outside of the
United States. Second, there was and is very little commerce between these two States, and it is
difficult to see how those low levels of commerce could have meaningfully been disrupted. For these
reasons, I would also dismiss this claim.
