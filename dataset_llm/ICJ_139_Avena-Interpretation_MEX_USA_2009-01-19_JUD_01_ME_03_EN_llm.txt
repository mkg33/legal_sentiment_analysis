quences flowing from this breach — The Avena Judgment remains binding.

 ished what is meant by an obligation of result : it is “an obligation
which requires a specific outcome” (Judgment, paragraph 27). It is clear
 hat an obligation falls upon the United States to provide the Mexican
nationals named in the Avena Judgment who remain on death row with
review and reconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 of the
Avena Judgment. But then the Court construes the scope of the obliga-
 ion :
       “The Court observes that this obligation of result is one which
     must be met within a reasonable period of time. Even serious efforts
     of the United States, should they fall short of providing review and
     reconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 of the Avena
     Judgment, would not be regarded as fulfilling this obligation of
     result.” (Para. 27 ; emphasis added.)

Almost five years have elapsed since the Avena Judgment was handed
down. Since, as the Court considers, time is of the essence and the actual
compliance performance has been poor, to say the least, the specific out-
come associated with the obligation of result cannot be regarded as
having been brought about by the United States.

     “while it seems both Parties regard paragraph 153 (9) of the Avena
     Judgment as an international obligation of result, the Parties none-
     theless apparently hold different views as to the meaning and scope


     of that obligation of result, namely, whether that understanding is
     shared by all United States federal and state authorities and whether
     that obligation falls upon those authorities” (Order, p. 326, para. 55).

   5. Although the Court reaches the conclusion that the matters claimed
by Mexico as requiring an interpretation are not matters decided by the
Court in its Avena Judgment and thus cannot give rise to the interpreta-
 ion requested by Mexico (Judgment, operative clause, paragraph 59 (1)),
 he Court accepts that “[o]n the one hand, it could be said that a variety
of factors suggest that there is a difference of perception that would con-
stitute a dispute under Article 60 of the Statute” (ibid., paragraph 31).
And then, after reviewing some of Mexico’s contentions, the Court
“observes that these elements could suggest a dispute between the Parties
within the sense of Article 60 of the Statute” (ibid., paragraph 35). Addi-
 ionally, the Court indicates — in a paragraph to be examined later, for
 t gives rise to divergent interpretations — that
        “Mexico did not specify that the obligation of the United States
     under the Avena Judgment was directly binding upon its organs,
     subdivisions or officials, although this might be inferred from the
     arguments it presented, in particular in its further written explana-
     tions.” (Ibid., paragraph 41 ; emphasis added.)

and scope of the Avena Judgment when it states that
     “considerations of domestic law which have so far hindered the imple-
     mentation of the obligation incumbent upon the United States, can-
     not relieve it of its obligation. A choice of means was allowed to the
     United States in the implementation of its obligation and, failing
     success within a reasonable period of time through the means chosen,
     it must rapidly turn to alternative and effective means of attaining
     that result.” (Ibid., paragraph 47 ; emphasis added.)

  9. The Court has clearly established that José Ernesto Medellín Rojas
     “was executed without being afforded the review and reconsidera-
     tion provided for by paragraphs 138 to 141 of the Avena Judgment,
     contrary to what was directed by the Court in its Order indicating
     provisional measures of 16 July 2008” (Judgment, paragraph 52).
In the operative clause of the Judgment, the Court has found unani-
mously that the United States “has breached the obligation incumbent
upon it” under the Court’s Order (ibid., paragraph 61 (2)). The Court
 eaves no doubt in its decision that the obligation upon the United States
not to execute the other four Mexican nationals named in the Order of
16 July 2008 “pending review and reconsideration being afforded to them
 s fully intact by virtue” of the Avena Judgment itself (ibid., para-
graph 54). In the operative clause of the Judgment, the Court reaffirms
“the continuing binding character of the obligations of the United States
of America under paragraph 153 (9) of the Avena Judgment” (ibid., para-
graph 61 (3)).
   10. The Court has found that the United States is in breach of its obli-
gations for having executed Mr. Medellín in violation of the Order of
16 July 2008. What is missing from the present Judgment is a determina-
 ion of the legal consequences which flow from the serious failure by the
United States to comply with the Order and the Avena Judgment.

 o “reiterate that its Avena Judgment remains binding and that the
United States continues to be under an obligation fully to implement it”
 Judgment, paragraph 60). It is to be hoped that the United States Con-

Court found, unanimously, that

     “should Mexican nationals nonetheless be sentenced to severe pen-
     alties, without their rights under Article 36, paragraph 1 (b), of the
     Convention having been respected, the United States of America
     shall provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsidera-
     tion of the conviction and sentence, so as to allow full weight to be
     given to the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention”
     (Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of
     America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 73, para. 153 (11)).

  18. In the Amicus Curiae Brief in support of Sanchez-Llamas as pet-
tioner for the writ of certiorari before the United States Supreme Court,
Mexico emphatically stated :

     “the Avena Judgment reaffirmed in the clearest possible terms that
     Article 36 of the Vienna Convention confers individual rights on all
     Mexican nationals who are detained or arrested in the United States”
     (Brief Amicus Curiae of the Government of the United Mexican
     States in support of Petitioner 3, 4, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon,
     126 S. Ct 2669 (2006) ; emphasis added).


        “The United States has no obligation to accept the reasoning under-
     lying the ICJ’s Judgments . . . As we have demonstrated, the
     ICJ’s reasoning is inconsistent with principles of treaty construc-
     tion . . . Moreover, the weight to be given an ICJ Judgment is at its
     nadir where, as here, the Executive Branch, whose views on treaty
     interpretation are entitled to at least ‘great weight’, has considered
     the ICJ’s decisions and determined that its own long standing inter-
     pretation of the treaty is the correct one. Notably, the withdrawal of
     the United States from the Optional Protocol will ensure that the
     United States incurs no further international legal obligations to
     review and reconsider convictions and sentences in light of violations
     of Article 36 based on the ICJ’s interpretation of the Convention.
     Under these circumstances and in light of the considerations dis-
     cussed above, this Court should conclude that Article 36 does not
     give a criminal defendant a private right to challenge his conviction
     and sentence on the ground that Article 36 (consular access) was
     breached.” (Ibid., p. 30 ; emphasis added.)

   28. This Court, in its LaGrand and Avena Judgments, has ruled that
Article 36, paragraph 1, creates individual rights for those in detention.
That pronouncement runs counter to the legal arguments advanced by
United States federal authorities and sustained by state and federal
courts. In LaGrand, the Court stated that it

     “cannot accept the argument of the United States which proceeds, in
     part, on the assumption that paragraph 2 of Article 36 applies only
     to the rights of the sending State and not also to those of the
     detained individual. The Court has already determined that Arti-
     cle 36, paragraph 1, creates individual rights for the detained person
     in addition to the rights accorded the sending State, and that conse-
     quently the reference to ‘rights’ in paragraph 2 must be read as
     applying not only to the rights of the sending State, but also to the
     rights of the detained individual.” (LaGrand (Germany v. United
     States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 497, para. 89 ;
     emphasis added.)
In the present case, the Court could have better fulfilled its judicial func-
 ion by dispelling all doubts raised by federal and state authorities in the
executive and judicial branches of government in the United States. That
should have been done by reaffirming the binding force of the LaGrand
and Avena Judgments and the existence of individual rights under Arti-
cle 36, even if that had meant acting on its own initiative, in order prop-
erly to construe the meaning or scope of the Avena Judgment.

default rule has not been revised, nor has any provision been made to
prevent its application” (ibid., p. 57, para. 113). Then the Court added :

        “The crucial point in this situation is that, by the operation of the
     procedural default rule as it is applied at present, the defendant is
     effectively barred from raising the issue of the violation of his rights
     under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention . . .” (ibid., p. 63,
     para. 134).

        “Medellín filed an initial application for a writ of habeas corpus,
     claiming for the first time, among other things, that his rights under


     Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated because he
     had not been advised of his right to contact the Mexican consular
     official after he was arrested. The district court found that Medellín
     failed to object to the violation of his Vienna Convention rights at
     trial and, as a result, concluded that his claim was procedurally
     barred from review.

        Medellín appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
     cuit, which also denied his application. The Fifth Circuit noted the
     I.C.J. decision in Avena, but determined that it was bound by the
     Supreme Court’s decision in Breard v. Greene, which held that
     claims based on a violation of the Vienna Convention are subject to
     procedural default rules.

       [W]e are bound by the Supreme Court’s determination that I.C.J.
     decisions are not binding on United States courts. As a result,
     Medellín . . . cannot show that Avena requires us to set aside Section
     5 and review and reconsider his Vienna Convention claim.” (Ex Parte
     Medellín, 223 S.W. 3d 315, 321, 332 (2006) ; emphasis added.)

     to the President’s Memorandum and his power ‘to establish binding
     rules of decision that preempt contrary state law’” (ibid., p. 1367).


   42. After making clear that unilaterally converting a non-self-executing
 reaty into a self-executing one is not among the means available to
 he United States President to enforce an international obligation, the
Supreme Court stated :

   44. It is justifiable to conclude that a dispute arises in the present case
out of the fundamentally different views taken by Mexico and the United
States on the interpretation to be given to the obligation imposed by the
Avena Judgment. But there is not only a conflict of legal views and of
 nterests between the two countries. There is a disagreement on several
points of law and, also, on the facts.

     “the [United States Supreme] Court found that the expression of the
     obligation to comply in Article 94 (1) somehow precluded the judi-
     cial branch — the authority best suited to implement the obligation
     imposed by Avena — from taking steps to comply. There is nothing
     in the text or object and purpose of Article 94 (1) that suggests such
     an incongruous result. It is moreover fundamentally inconsistent
     with the interpretation of the Avena Judgment as imposing an obli-
     gation of result incumbent on all constituent organs, including the
     judiciary. Needless to say, Mexico does not agree with the Supreme
     Court’s interpretation.” (Submission of Mexico in Response to the
     Written Observations of the United States of America, 17 Septem-
     ber 2008, p. 15, para. 53 ; emphasis added.)


  49. Clearly, this is an issue on which Mexico has indicated “the precise

     “(a) That the correct interpretation of the obligation incumbent
          upon the United States under paragraph 153 (9) of the Avena
          Judgment is that it is an obligation of result . . .
          and that, pursuant to the interpretation of the foregoing obliga-
          tion of result,
           (1) the United States, acting through all of its competent
               organs and all its constituent subdivisions, including all
               branches of government and any official, state or federal,
               exercising government authority, must take all measures
               necessary to provide the reparation of review and recon-
               sideration mandated by the Avena Judgment in para-
               graph 153 (9)” (Submission of Mexico in Response to the
               Written Observations of the United States of America,
               17 September 2008, p. 24, para. 86 ; emphasis added ;
               Judgment, paragraph 10).

        “Whereas the international responsibility of a State is engaged by
     the action of the competent organs and authorities acting in that
     State, whatever they may be ; whereas the United States should take
     all measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand is not
     executed pending the final decision in these proceedings ; whereas,
     according to the information available to the Court, implementation
     of the measures indicated in the present Order falls within the juris-
     diction of the Governor of Arizona ; whereas the Government of the
     United States is consequently under the obligation to transmit the
     present Order to the said Governor ; whereas the Governor of Arizona
     is under the obligation to act in conformity with the international under-
     takings of the United States” (LaGrand (Germany v. United
     States of America), Provisional Measures, Order of 3 March 1999,
     I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), p. 16, para. 28 ; emphasis added).

Responsibility provides :
        “1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of
     that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legis-
     lative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position
     it holds in the organization, and whatever its character as an organ
     of the central government or of the territorial unit of the State.”
     (Report of the International Law Commission, Fifty-third Session,
     General Assembly Official Records, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10).)

   64. In its Commentary to Article 4, the International Law Commis-
sion holds that the “reference to a ‘State organ’ covers all the individual
and collective entities which make up the organization of the State and
act on its behalf”. It adds that “the State is responsible for the conduct of
 ts own organs, acting in that capacity”, something that has long been
recognized in international judicial decisions. The Commission also points
out that
     “the reference to a State organ in Article 4 is intended in the most
     general sense. It is not limited to the organs of the central govern-
     ment, to officials at a high level or to persons with responsibility for
     the external relations of the State. It extends to organs of govern-
     ment of whatever kind or classification, exercising whatever func-
     tions, and at whatever level in the hierarchy, including those at pro-
     vincial or even local level.” (International Law Commission, Draft
     Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful
     Acts, with commentaries Ch. II, Art. 4, Yearbook of the International
     Law Commission, 2001, Vol. II, Part Two ; emphasis added.)
