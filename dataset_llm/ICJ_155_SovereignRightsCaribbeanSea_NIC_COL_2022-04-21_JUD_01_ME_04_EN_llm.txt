                       1. To my regret, I had to vote against the decision of the Court, which
                    found that it had jurisdiction ratione temporis to entertain facts and
                    events alleged by Nicaragua to have occurred after 27 November 2013
                    (Judgment, para. 261, subpara. 1). Indeed, this is the date on which the
                    Pact of Bogotá, the basis of the Court’s jurisdiction, ceased to be in force
                    in relations between the two Parties.
                       2. Under the terms of Article XXXI, subparagraph (c), of the Pact,
                    the Parties recognize “the jurisdiction of the Court . . . in all disputes of a
                    juridical nature that arise among them concerning . . . [t]he existence of
                    any fact which, if established, would constitute the breach of an interna-
                    tional obligation”. Article XXXI also states that this recognition is valid
                    only “so long as the present Treaty is in force”.
                       3. In my view, the Court should have interpreted the Pact, and in par-
                    ticular the compromissory clause contained in its Article XXXI, using the
                    means of interpretation provided for in the 1969 Vienna Convention on
                    the Law of Treaties (hereinafter the “VCLT”), which have customary sta-
                    tus (Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea‑Bissau v. Senegal), Judg‑
                    ment, I.C.J. Reports 1991, pp. 69‑70, para. 48). Thus, pursuant to
                    Article 31, paragraph 1, of the VCLT, “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in
                    good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the
                    terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and pur-
                    pose”. The Court has emphasized that “[i]nterpretation must be based
                    above all upon the text of the treaty” (Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab
                    Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 22, para. 41; Legal‑
                    ity of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary
                    Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 318, para. 100).
                       4. Pursuant to Article LVI of the Pact,
                          “[t]he present Treaty shall remain in force indefinitely, but may be
                          denounced upon one year’s notice, at the end of which period it shall
                          cease to be in force with respect to the State denouncing it, but shall
                          continue in force for the remaining signatories. The denunciation
                          shall be addressed to the Pan American Union, which shall transmit
                          it to the other Contracting Parties.
                             The denunciation shall have no effect with respect to pending pro­
                          cedures initiated prior to the transmission of the particular notification.”
                    Colombia proceeded to denounce the Pact on 27 November 2012, and
                    that denunciation took effect from 27 November 2013.
                      5. Clearly, the termination of the Pact of Bogotá after the filing of the
                    Application cannot affect the Court’s jurisdiction, established by its





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 258                                                                                   10/09/23 09:40

                    2016 decision, to entertain the dispute as it existed on 26 November 2013,
                    the date on which the Application was filed by Nicaragua. In my view,
                    however, that jurisdiction cannot extend to facts and events which
                    occurred after the critical date of 27 November 2013.
                       6. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of Arti-
                    cle XXXI, subparagraph (c), of the Pact, from that date onwards the
                    Court was unable to entertain a dispute between the Parties concerning
                    “[t]he existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute the
                    breach of an international obligation”. In order to comply with this pro-
                    vision, the Court should thus have declared that it lacked jurisdiction to
                    rule on all incidents alleged by the Applicant to have occurred after the
                    critical date of 27 November 2013.
                       7. Instead of adopting this approach and interpreting the compromis-
                    sory clause in a manner consistent with the consent given by the Parties
                    to its jurisdiction, the Court invokes precedents (Judgment, para. 44)
                    relating to jurisdiction ratione materiae and, above all, the admissibility of
                    late claims made after the filing of the application, in cases where the
                    jurisdictional title was still valid. It derives from that jurisprudence
                    two criteria which apply only to late claims, and which have no bearing
                    on determining jurisdiction ratione temporis when the parties’ consent to
                    that jurisdiction has lapsed. None of the cases to which the Court refers
                    (ibid.) concerns facts or events that occurred after the jurisdictional title
                    was no longer in force between the parties. It is clear, therefore, that the
                    present case cannot be treated in the same way as the precedents men-
                    tioned by the Court, since the situation concerned is not comparable to
                    theirs. The Court acknowledges that “the question posed by Colombia
                    has not previously been presented to the Court” (ibid., para. 43), and this
                    is, moreover, why this decision is so important. Unable to rely on prece-
                    dent in this case, the Court was forced to break new ground, but it has
                    failed to properly produce reasoning in support of this.


                       8. The Court, thus, has not provided a solution founded on the com-
                    promissory clause of the Pact of Bogotá, which instrument does not allow
                    it to rule on the incidents alleged to have occurred after 27 November
                    2013, the date on which the Pact ceased to be in force and to have any
                    effect in relations between the two Parties.
                       9. It should be noted that the Court places particular emphasis on the
                    case concerning Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Mat‑
                    ters (Djibouti v. France). In that case, however, it ruled on the basis of
                    forum prorogatum in order to establish its jurisdiction ratione materiae.
                    The Court assessed the scope of the consent given by France to Djibouti’s
                    application, from which it followed that “the claims relating to the arrest
                    warrants arise in respect of issues which are outside the scope of the
                    Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008,
                    p. 212, para. 88).

                       10. Nicaragua, aware of the inadequacy of its argument seeking to link
                    the present case to the criteria relating to the admissibility of late claims,
                    described the facts and events in question as “composite and continuing”
                    (Judgment, para. 38). The Court, moreover, did not comment on this
                    expression, which is borrowed from the law on international responsibil-
                    ity and is of no help in answering the question of jurisdiction ratione tem‑
                    poris.
                       11. The absence of a title of jurisdiction ratione temporis after the crit-
                    ical date of 27 November 2013 should, in my view, have prompted the
                    Court to refuse to rule on the events that occurred after that date. Even if
                    the issues raised by the incidents in question in the present case do not
                    have profound consequences, the fact remains that by adopting such a
                    broad interpretation of consent to its jurisdiction under the Pact of
                    Bogotá, the Court risks undermining one of the pillars of its relationship
                    with the States parties under the Statute.
                       12. In view of the foregoing, I also voted against subparagraph 2 of the
                    operative clause relating to Colombia’s violations of Nicaragua’s sover-
                    eign rights and jurisdiction (ibid., para. 261, subpara. 2).
                       13. I likewise voted against the third point of the operative clause
                    relating to the granting of fishing permits by Colombia (ibid., subpara. 3).
                    First, because, here too, the Court should not have ruled on some of the
                    alleged incidents, since they occurred after the critical date of 27 Novem-
                    ber 2013. Second, because the Court did not rely on evidence capable of
                    demonstrating that Colombia granted fishing permits relating to Nicara-
                    gua’s exclusive economic zone. The Court refers to a number of resolu-
                    tions, stating that Colombia continues to assert “the right to authorize
                    fishing activities in parts of Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone” (ibid.,
                    para. 119). Nevertheless, this does not prove that Colombia granted per-
                    mits authorizing fishing in the zone attributed to Nicaragua.

                      14. Finally, I voted against subparagraph 7 of the operative clause,
                    which states that Nicaragua’s straight baselines are not in conformity
                    with customary international law (ibid., para. 261, subpara. 7). This is a
                    counter‑claim relating to alleged violations of Colombia’s sovereign rights
                    and maritime spaces resulting from the use of straight baselines by Nica-
                    ragua. In my view, the Court would only be able to assess whether Nica-
                    ragua’s straight baselines were consistent with international law if
                    Colombia could prove that the drawing of such baselines by Nicaragua
                    specially affected its own rights in its exclusive economic zone.

                       15. Nicaragua argued before the Court that the straight baselines
                    established by Decree No. 33‑2013 did not call into question the delimita-
                    tion of the maritime areas carried out in 2012 and did not shift seaward
                    the outer limit of its exclusive economic zone.

                    baselines by a coastal State. It is for each State to assess and take those
                    conditions into account. One limitation is that “[t]he system of straight
                    baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off the
                    territorial sea of another State from the high seas or an exclusive eco-
                    nomic zone” (UNCLOS, Art. 7, para. 6). The Court emphasizes that the
                    straight baselines “convert into internal waters certain areas which other-
                    wise would have been part of Nicaragua’s territorial sea or exclusive eco-
                    nomic zone and convert into territorial sea certain areas which would
                    have been part of Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone” (Judgment,
                    para. 259). It adds that “[t]he establishment of Nicaragua’s straight base-
                    lines limits the rights that Colombian vessels would have had in those
                    areas” (ibid.). I am of the opinion, however, that such a limitation affects
                    Colombia in the same way as all other States. Therefore, Colombia can-
                    not be considered a State specially affected, that is to say an injured State,
                    under the law of international responsibility, by Nicaragua’s use of
                    straight baselines (Article 42 of the International Law Commission’s Arti-
                    cles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts).
                    This is, in effect, the sole basis on which Colombia could have brought
                    before the Court its allegations that its sovereign rights and maritime
                    spaces had been violated by Nicaragua’s use of straight baselines.

                       17. By granting Colombia’s request, the Court is creating a precedent
                    which may result in an increase in cases of this kind, given the existence
                    of a number of straight baselines not wholly consistent with the criteria
                    set out in Article 7 of UNCLOS. Under Article 16 of that instrument,
                    charts or lists of geographical co-­ordinates relating to the drawing of
                    straight baselines are deposited with the Secretary-­    General of the
                    United Nations, and they are thus sufficiently publicized to other States.
                    It is through diplomatic means that coastal States have protested against
                    the drawing of certain baselines.
