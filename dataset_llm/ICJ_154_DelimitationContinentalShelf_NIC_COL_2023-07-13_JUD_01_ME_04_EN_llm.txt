        1. Much of law is about reasonableness. The unreasonableness in the approach of the majority
is revealed in their conclusion that “even if a State can demonstrate that it is entitled to an extended
continental shelf, that entitlement may not extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of
another State” (Judgment, para. 81). Thus, even if a State establishes that its outer continental shelf
meets the criteria for natural prolongation, according to the majority it cannot benefit from the full
extent of its shelf  that is, it cannot extend within 200 nautical miles of the baselines of another
State 1. Ordinarily, a coastal State would benefit from the full extent of such a shelf, subject, of course,
to the application of Article 83 on maritime delimitation. The proposition in paragraph 81 is an
extraordinary one, and it finds no support in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS) or in customary international law; it strikes a jangling, discordant note in the
otherwise harmonious relationship between the various maritime zones in the law of the sea.
Regrettably, the majority judgment fails to substantiate its proposition, which assumes that a coastal
State’s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) with its attendant distance-determined
continental shelf has priority over another State’s outer continental shelf based on natural
prolongation. In that regard, it is to be noted that Article 77 of the Convention, which reflects
customary international law, in setting out the rights of the State over the continental shelf, does not
distinguish between a shelf that is based on natural prolongation and a shelf that is
distance-determined. A coastal State enjoys the same sovereign rights in respect of its continental
shelf, whether in relation to a natural prolongation-determined shelf or a distance-determined shelf.
The relevant provisions of UNCLOS are set out in the Annex to this opinion. It is important to note
that these provisions reflect customary international law; they are applicable in the current case
because, unlike Nicaragua, Colombia is not a party to UNCLOS.

       2. The Judgment does not establish that, under customary international law, there is a
hierarchical relationship between continental shelf entitlements based on the criteria of natural
prolongation and distance set out in Article 76 (1) of the Convention. The majority’s negative
response to the first question requires a demonstration that there is an intrinsic, inherent limitation
on the extent of a State’s continental shelf entitlement based on the criterion of natural prolongation.
Under customary international law, there is no inherent limitation on the extent of a State’s
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles such that it cannot extend into a neighbouring coastal
State’s exclusive economic zone with its attendant continental shelf. In effect, the Judgment has
denied a coastal State the full benefit of the natural prolongation criterion in Article 76 (1) of the
Convention, which reflects customary international law. The position taken by the majority is all the
more strange given that in the Tunisia/Libya case, the Court concluded that “[a]ccording to the first
part of paragraph 1 the natural prolongation of the land territory is the main criterion” (Continental
Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1982, p. 48, para. 47). It must be
emphasized, however, that, in that case, the Court did not suggest that there was a hierarchy between
the criterion of natural prolongation and the criterion of distance.

      3. The Judgment fails to identify any quality or element in title to a distance-determined
continental shelf that would make it prevail over title to a shelf based on natural prolongation.

       4. In Guinea/Guinea-Bissau, the question of the relationship between the two criteria in
Article 76 was considered. In that case, speaking of the distance criterion in Article 76 (1), the
tribunal held that

       “[t]his second rule for determining the continental shelf by reference to distance,
       without derogating from the rule of natural prolongation, reduces its scope by
       substituting it in certain circumstances specified in the above-mentioned paragraph of
       Article 76 of the 1982 Convention, and through the other provisions of that Article”.
       (Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary between Guinea and Guinea-Bissau
       (Guinea/Guinea-Bissau), 1985, United Nations, RIAA, Vol. XIX, p. 191, para. 115
       (French) and International Law Reports (ILR), Vol. 77, p. 686, para. 115 (English).)

What is significant here is that the tribunal emphasizes that the distance criterion does not derogate
from the rule of natural prolongation, and then states that there are “therefore two rules between
which there is neither priority nor precedence” (ibid., para. 116). It is, of course, true that this decision
did not address the precise circumstances of the present case. However, the statement of law that
there is neither priority nor precedence between the two criteria is, in principle, beyond question.

       5. Since, under Article 76 of UNCLOS, title to a continental shelf based on natural
prolongation is co-equal with title to a continental shelf based on distance, a continental shelf based
on natural prolongation that overlaps with a shelf based on distance is as amenable to delimitation as
overlapping continental shelves based on natural prolongation or distance. Indeed, there is scholarly
writing that Article 83 on the delimitation of the continental shelf “confirms that no distinction is
made between the continental shelf within and beyond 200 nautical miles” (see Xuexia Liao, “Is
There a Hierarchical Relationship between Natural prolongation and Distance in the Continental
Shelf Delimitation?”, International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law, 2018, Vol. 33 (1),
pp. 79-115); certainly, there is nothing in Article 83 to indicate that it is not applicable to the
delimitation of the maritime boundary between the continental shelf of a coastal State beyond
200 nautical miles from the relevant baselines and the continental shelf of another State within
200 nautical miles from the relevant baselines. Indeed, the Convention must be seen as proceeding
on the basis of co-equality between title to a continental shelf based on natural prolongation and title
based on distance. Since there is co-equality, one title cannot extinguish the other title because both
titles have the same valency; consequently, there may be an overlap, in which case maritime
delimitation under Article 83 comes into play. More generally, this is also true of the relationship
between the maritime zone of one State and a similar maritime zone of another State. Thus, the
exclusive economic zone of State A has the same valency as the exclusive economic zone of State B,
to which it is adjacent or opposite. The law of the sea is so configured that a coastal State benefits
from the full extent of its maritime zones — whether territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or
continental shelf, to name a few — subject, of course, to maritime delimitation. The principle of
co-equality of maritime zones is a necessary feature of the Convention, whose aim is to establish,
“with due regard for the sovereignty of all States, a legal order for the seas and oceans” (UNCLOS,
preamble). Co-equality of maritime zones, an assumption of the Convention, gives rise to
overlapping entitlements which call for maritime delimitation. The approach of the majority is
antithetical to maritime delimitation, a tool essential for the “legal order for the seas and oceans”,
because that approach sees title to the maritime zone of one State extinguishing title to a similar
maritime zone of another State.

      6. The Judgment in paragraph 58 cites Nicaragua’s submission that the decision in the Bay of
Bengal cases means that a grey area is created in which the two States “must co-operate”
(Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar), Judgment,
ITLOS Reports 2012, pp. 64-68, paras. 225-240; Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary Arbitration

                                                 -3-

(Bangladesh v. India), Award of 7 July 2014, RIAA, Vol. XXXII, pp. 104-106, paras. 336-346). It is
true that this result is untidy since one State has sovereign rights over the superjacent waters while
another State has sovereign rights over the sea-bed. However the obligation to co-operate should not
be undervalued. It should not be overlooked that Article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the
United Nations provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is “to achieve international
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian
character”. Indeed, in 1945, one of the great hopes of the international community was that after the
atrocities of the Second World War, the era of national sovereignty would be replaced by an era of
international co-operation.

       7. The Judgment refers to Colombia’s submissions emphasizing that the EEZ was the result of
a compromise reached at the Conference and which took into account proposals by developing Latin
American and African countries. Colombia is correct in outlining the general features of the EEZ,
which is neither territorial sea nor high sea, but in which the coastal State has exclusive sovereign
rights over the living and non-living resources. The Judgment cites Colombia as contending “that an
exclusive economic zone the water column of which is divorced from the sea-bed and subsoil is no
longer an exclusive economic zone” (para. 64). However, by the same token, it could be said that a
continental shelf that may not extend within 200 nautical miles of the baselines of another State, even
though it satisfies the scientific criteria for natural prolongation, is no longer a continental shelf.
Moreover, although the concept of the EEZ emanated from developing States, it was not part of the
bargain that they would surrender the benefits of an outer continental shelf based on natural
prolongation; the bargain was that, in respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, a payment would be made to the International Seabed
Authority (ISA) to be distributed to States parties to the Convention, taking into account the needs
of developing States, on the basis of equitable sharing criteria (see UNCLOS, Article 82).

       8. The majority advance two main arguments for the conclusion that “under customary
international law, a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured may not extend within 200 nautical
miles from the baselines of another State” (Judgment, para. 79). The first main argument is that,
under customary international law, there is a rule prohibiting a State’s outer continental shelf from
extending within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State.


                        THE FIRST MAIN ARGUMENT: THERE IS A RULE OF
                                CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW

       9. In the 1969 North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the Court held that customary international
law had two elements: extensive and virtually uniform practice, and opinio juris. The International
Law Commission (ILC), the United Nations body charged with the responsibility of the codification
and progressive development of international law, has concluded that these two elements must be
separately determined (see the ILC’s 2018 Draft conclusions on identification of customary
international law, Conclusion 3, paragraph 2), no doubt to guard against the temptation of simply
snatching opinio juris from practice. Paragraph 8 of the ILC’s draft Commentary on its Conclusion 3
emphasizes that “the existence of one element may not be deduced merely from the existence of the
other”; but, in the circumstances of this case, this is precisely what the Judgment does: it deduces
opinio juris merely from the existing practice of 39 States.


       10. In the Lotus case, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) found that the
practice of abstention was, by itself, not sufficient to constitute customary international law; it was
necessary to provide separately evidence of opinio juris, that is evidence that the practice was

                                                        -4-

prompted by a sense of legal obligation (see “Lotus”, Judgment No. 9, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A,
No. 10, p. 28). In the words of the PCIJ, “for only if such abstention were based on [States] being

if there is such a presumption, it must be one that is rebuttable. In the circumstances of this case, any
presumption of opinio juris is rebutted by the very clear possibility, as set out below, that the practice
of self-constraint may be explained by considerations other than a sense of legal obligation.


       11. Against this background, the opinion now proceeds to examine, first, the evidence relating
to State practice and, secondly, the evidence relating to opinio juris.


       12. Article 76, paragraph 7, requires the coastal State to delineate the outer limits of its
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the
territorial sea is measured. Article 76, paragraph 8, requires the coastal State to submit to the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS or the Commission) information on the
limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth
of the territorial sea is measured. The evidence before the Court is that 55 submissions have been
made to the CLCS in which coastal States could have, on geological or geomorphological grounds,
extended their continental shelves within the 200-nautical-mile zones of other States; of that number,
51 submissions made by 39 States refrained from asserting limits that extended within 200 nautical
miles of the baselines of another State.


       13. It is acknowledged that there is a basis for the Court’s conclusion that, “[t]aken as a whole,
the practice of States may be considered sufficiently widespread and uniform for the purpose of the
identification of customary international law” (Judgment, para. 77). This is so because the evidence
shows that of 43 States that could have claimed an outer continental shelf that extends within
200 nautical miles of the baselines of another State, 39 have chosen not to so extend their shelves.
There is therefore practice that can be considered sufficiently widespread and uniform. However, the
reasoning in the Judgment completely breaks down in relation to the element of opinio juris.


       14. The Court found that the practice before the CLCS “is indicative of opinio juris, even if
such practice may have been motivated in part by considerations other than a sense of legal
obligation” (ibid.). This conclusion is unsafe, because the possibility that the practice was motivated
by considerations other than a sense of legal obligation permeates and infects that practice in its

determined inferentially from all the relevant circumstances. In the absence of clear evidence to the
contrary, it is simply impossible in this case to separate practice that is properly motivated by a sense
of legal obligation from practice that is not so motivated. Nicaragua has submitted that the
self-constraint of States “is motivated by considerations other than a sense of legal obligation, in
particular a desire to avoid the possibility of their submission giving rise to a dispute with the result
that the Commission would not consider it” (Judgment, para. 57). Indeed, Nicaragua points out that
not even one CLCS submission “states directly or even indirectly that they refrain from encroaching
into the EEZ of third States because the EEZ has priority over any claim of an extended continental
shelf” 2. It also points out that, in respect of the protests filed in relation to the CLCS submissions of
the four States that claim an outer continental shelf within 200 nautical miles of the baselines of
another State, “not a single one of the protests has alleged that there was a rule of customary
international law that automatically gave priority to the EEZ or 200 [nautical miles] continental shelf

       15. The CLCS procedure set out in paragraph 8 of Article 76 of the Convention has special
significance for the coastal State. Under that paragraph, after the Commission has received the
information submitted to it by the coastal State, it makes recommendations on matters related to the
establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf. In accordance with the last sentence of
paragraph 8, the “limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these
recommendations shall be final and binding”. Every coastal State would wish to be in a position to
establish limits of the shelf that are final and binding. Every coastal State, therefore, has an incentive
to ensure that it does not take any action that would prevent the Commission from making
recommendations on the basis of the information that it has submitted to the Commission. One such
action that would have that result is addressed by Article 5 (a) of Annex I of the Rules of Procedure
of the CLCS, which reads: “In cases where a land or maritime dispute exists, the Commission shall
not consider and qualify a submission made by any of the States concerned in the dispute.”


       16. It is therefore likely that the reason for the States’ self-constraint is the very real possibility
that the claim to an outer continental shelf which extends within 200 nautical miles of the baselines
of another State would lead to a protest, giving rise to a dispute, thereby preventing the Commission
from qualifying or considering the coastal State’s submission. We know that this has happened to
the four States that have claimed such an extension. There were protests; in accordance with
Article 5 (a) of Annex 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the CLCS, their submissions would not have
been processed 4.


       17. The possibility that the self-constraint is explicable by other than legal considerations is,
therefore, very live in the circumstances of this case, and it is a possibility that affects every single
claim made by the 39 States. It is not confined, as the Judgment claims, to a part of those claims
because the entirety of the claims may have been motivated by considerations other than a sense of
legal obligation. Moreover, it is notable that in describing Nicaragua’s submission, in paragraph 57
of the Judgment, the Court uses the language “in particular a desire to avoid the possibility of their
submission giving rise to a dispute with the result that the Commission would not consider it”
(emphasis added). Thus, there might have been other examples of a situation in which the submission
to the CLCS was motivated by considerations other than a sense of legal obligation. Notably,
although the Judgment in paragraph 57 makes reference to Nicaragua’s submission, nowhere in its
later analysis (see paragraphs 68-79) does it address that submission.


        18. The Judgment places great reliance on the Gulf of Maine case to support its conclusion that

        “given its extent over a long period of time, this State practice may be seen as an
        expression of opinio juris, which is a constitutive element of customary international
        law. Indeed, this element may be demonstrated ‘by induction based on the analysis of a
        sufficiently extensive and convincing practice’ (Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary
