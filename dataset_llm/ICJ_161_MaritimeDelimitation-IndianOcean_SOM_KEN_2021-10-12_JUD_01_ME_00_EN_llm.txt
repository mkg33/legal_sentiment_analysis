                         15. By letters dated 23 December 2020, the Parties were informed that, in
                      light of the restrictions in place across the globe as a result of the COVID‑19
                      pandemic, the hearings due to open on 15 March 2021 would be held by video
                      link. A modified detailed schedule was transmitted to them at the same time.

                     214 	                maritime delimitation (judgment)

                        16. By a letter dated 28 January 2021, Kenya, referring to “serious difficulties in
                     preparing for the hearing due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic” and
                     expressing concerns about proceeding with hearings by video link, requested “that
                     the hearing be postponed until such a time as the pandemic conditions would have
                     subsided”. By a letter dated 3 February 2021, Somalia objected to this request. Fur-
                     ther communications on the subject were exchanged between the Parties. By letters
                     dated 12 February 2021, the Parties were informed that the Court had decided to
                     maintain the hearings as scheduled, starting on 15 March 2021, in a hybrid format,
                     with some judges attending the oral proceedings in person in the Great Hall of Jus-
                     tice and others participating remotely by video link, and with the representatives of
                     the Parties to the case participating either in person or by video link.
                        17. On 5 March 2021, Kenya presented a request to produce “new documen-
                     tation and evidence”. Enclosed with Kenya’s letter were Appendix 1, accompa-
                     nied by two annexes, and Appendix 2, consisting of eight volumes with annexes.
                     Kenya’s letter stated that Volume I of Appendix 2 explained “the nature and
                     relevance of the new and additional evidence”. By a letter dated 9 March 2021,
                     Somalia informed the Court that it did not object to the production of the mat­
                     erials that Kenya wished to submit, except for Volume I of Appendix 2. With
                     respect to Volume I of Appendix 2, Somalia indicated, however, that it would
                     withdraw its objection if it were given the opportunity to respond to it.           `

                         18. By letters dated 11 March 2021, the Parties were informed that, in light
                     of the absence of an objection on the part of Somalia and pursuant to Arti-
                     cle 56, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the documents contained in Appen-
                     dix 1 and in Volumes II to VIII of Appendix 2 could be produced and would
                     form part of the case file. Having considered the views of the Parties and the
                     particular circumstances of the case, the Court decided to authorize the produc-
                     tion of Volume I of Appendix 2 (hereinafter “Appendix 2”) by Kenya, on the
                     understanding that Somalia would have the opportunity to comment thereon
                     during the hearings. In addition, the Court decided that if Somalia wished to
                     comment in writing on the materials that were produced by Kenya and to sub-
                     mit documents in support of its comments, it should do so no later than
                     22 March 2021. Somalia commented on these materials during the hearings and
                     filed written comments on 22 March 2021.
                         19. By a letter dated 11 March 2021 and received in the Registry on 12 March
                     2021, the Agent of Kenya informed the Court that his Government would not
                     be participating in the hearings in the case and indicated the reasons for that
                     decision. The Agent requested the opportunity to address the Court orally
                     before the commencement of the hearings and to submit a “position paper”, a
                     copy of which was enclosed with his letter. By a letter dated 12 March 2021,
                     Somalia objected to the two requests made by the Agent of Kenya. By letters
                     dated 15 March 2021, the Parties were informed that the Court had decided not
                     to grant either of the two requests made by Kenya.
                         20. By a letter dated 15 March 2021, the Co-Agent of Kenya stated that
                     “while affirming that it [would] not participate in the hearings on the merits,
                     Kenya wishe[d] to inform the Court that it nevertheless intend[ed] to utilize
                     thirty minutes out of the time allocated to it on the 18th March, 2021, to orally
                     address the Court”. Somalia responded by a letter of the same date, stating that
                     it welcomed Kenya’s decision to participate in the hearings. By letters dated
                     16 March 2021, the Parties were informed that the Court was prepared to give
                     Kenya the opportunity to address it on 18 March 2021 (during the session orig-
                     inally scheduled for Kenya’s oral pleadings), for the purpose of Kenya’s partici-

                     pation in the oral proceedings and the presentation of its contentions on the
                     merits of the case. By a letter dated 17 March 2021, Kenya indicated that it
                     would “not utilize the opportunity provided by the Court” to participate in the
                     oral proceedings on 18 March 2021.
                        21. By a letter dated 18 March 2021, Kenya submitted four new documents
                     “for the Court’s information and consideration”. By a letter dated 22 March
                     2021, Somalia argued that these documents were neither new nor critical and
                     were of no probative value in support of Kenya’s arguments. By letters dated
                     23 March 2021, the Parties were informed that the Court had decided that these
                     four new documents and Somalia’s observations thereon would be included in
                     the case file.
                        22. Pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 2, of its Rules, the Court, after ascer-
                     taining the views of the Parties, decided that copies of the pleadings and docu-
                     ments annexed would be made accessible to the public on the opening of the
                     oral proceedings. It also decided that the additional materials submitted by
                     Kenya prior to and during the hearings and the written comments of Somalia
                     thereon (see paragraphs 17, 18 and 21 above) would be made public.

                       23. Public hearings were held from 15 to 18 March 2021, at which the Court
                     heard the oral arguments of:
                     For Somalia: H.E. Mr. Mahdi Mohammed Gulaid,
                                   Mr. Alain Pellet,
                                   Mr. Philippe Sands,
                                   Ms Alina Miron,
                                   Mr. Paul S. Reichler,
                                   Mr. Edward Craven,
                                   Mr. Mohamed Omar Ibrahim.
                        24. At the hearings, a Member of the Court put a question to Somalia, to
                     which a reply was given in writing, in accordance with Article 61, paragraph 4,
                     of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to Article 72 of the Rules of Court, Kenya was

                          4.   To adjudge and declare that Kenya, by its conduct in the disputed area,
                               has violated its international obligations and is responsible under inter-
                               national law to make full reparation to Somalia, including inter alia by
                               making available to Somalia all seismic, geologic, bathymetric and
                               other technical data acquired in areas that are determined by the Court
                               to be subject to the sovereignty and/or sovereign rights and jurisdiction
                               of Somalia.”
                       28. Since Kenya did not participate in the oral proceedings, no formal sub-
                     missions were presented on behalf of its Government at the hearings.

                         29. The Court regrets Kenya’s decision not to participate in the oral
                      proceedings held in March 2021. Nevertheless, the Court had extensive
                     information about Kenya’s views, having received its Counter-­Memorial
                      and Rejoinder, as well as numerous volumes containing additional evi-
                      dence and arguments it submitted to the Court in March 2021 (see para-
                     graphs 17, 18 and 21 above).
                         30. The Court recalls that the oral proceedings were conducted in a
                      hybrid format, in accordance with Article 59, paragraph 2, of the Rules
                     of Court and on the basis of the Court’s Guidelines for the parties on the
                     organization of hearings by video link, adopted on 13 July 2020 and
                     ­communicated to the Parties on 12 February 2021. Prior to the opening
                      of the hybrid hearings, the Parties were invited to participate in compre-
                      hensive technical tests, and Somalia did so. During the oral proceedings,
                      a number of judges were present in the Great Hall of Justice, while others
                      joined the proceedings via video link, allowing them to view and hear the
                      speaker and see any demonstrative exhibits displayed. Each Party was
                      permitted to have up to four representatives present in the Great Hall of
                      Justice at any one time and was offered the use of an additional room in
                      the Peace Palace from which members of the delegation were able to par-
                      ticipate via video link. Members of the delegations were also given the
                      opportunity to participate via video link from other locations of their
                      choice.

                        31. Somalia and Kenya are adjacent States on the coast of East Africa.
                     Somalia is located in the Horn of Africa. It borders Kenya to the
                     south‑west, Ethiopia to the west and Djibouti to the north‑west. Soma-
                     lia’s coastline faces the Gulf of Aden to the north and the Indian Ocean
                     to the east. Kenya, for its part, shares a land boundary with Somalia to
                     the north‑east, Ethiopia to the north, South Sudan to the north‑west,





8 Ord_1229.indb 30                                                                                          5/12/22 08:27

                     Uganda to the west and Tanzania to the south. Its coastline faces the
                     Indian Ocean (see sketch-map No. 1 below, p. 221).
                         32. On 15 July 1924, Italy and the United Kingdom concluded a treaty
                     regulating certain questions concerning the boundaries of their respective
                     territories in East Africa, including what Somalia describes as “the Italian
                     colony of Jubaland”, located in present-day Somalia, and the British
                     ­colony of Kenya. By an Exchange of Notes dated 16 and 26 June 1925,
                      the boundary between the Italian and British colonial territories was
                      redefined in its southernmost section. Between 1925 and 1927, a joint
                      British-­Italian commission surveyed and demarcated the boundary. Follow-­
                      ing the completion of this exercise, the commission recorded its decisions
                      in an Agreement signed by British and Italian representatives on 17 Decem-
                      ber 1927 (hereinafter the “1927 Agreement”). That Agreement was for-
                      mally confirmed by an Exchange of Notes of 22 November 1933 between
                     the British and Italian Governments. The Court will collectively refer to
                     the 1927 Agreement and this Exchange of Notes as the “1927/1933 treaty
                      arrangement”. Somalia and Kenya gained their independence in 1960 and
                      1963, respectively.
                         33. Both Parties signed UNCLOS on 10 December 1982. Kenya and
                      Somalia ratified it on 2 March 1989 and 24 July 1989, respectively, and
                      the Convention entered into force for them on 16 November 1994.
                         34. Both Somalia and Kenya have filed submissions with the Commis-
                      sion on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (hereinafter the “CLCS” or
                      the “Commission”) in order to obtain its recommendations on matters
                      related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelves
                      beyond 200 nautical miles, in accordance with Article 76, paragraph 8, of
                      UNCLOS. While they previously objected to the consideration by the
                      Commission of each other’s submissions, these objections were subse-
                      quently withdrawn. As of the date of the present Judgment, the Commis-
                      sion has yet to issue its recommendations in respect of the Parties’
                      submissions.


                                  II. Overview of the Positions of the Parties

                        35. The Parties have adopted fundamentally different approaches to
                     the delimitation of the maritime areas. Somalia argues that no maritime
                     boundary exists between the two States and asks the Court to plot a
                     boundary line using the equidistance/special circumstances method (for
                     the delimitation of the territorial sea) and the equidistance/relevant cir-
                     cumstances method (for the maritime areas beyond the territorial sea). In
                     its view, an unadjusted equidistance line throughout all maritime areas
                     achieves the equitable result required by international law. Kenya, for its
                     part, contends that there is already an agreed maritime boundary between
                     the Parties, because Somalia has acquiesced to a boundary that follows
                     the parallel of latitude at 1° 39ʹ 43.2ʺ S (hereinafter “the parallel of lati-
                     tude”). Kenya further contends that the Parties have considered this to be





8 Ord_1229.indb 32                                                                                    5/12/22 08:27

8 Ord_1229.indb 34                                              5/12/22 08:27

                     222 	              maritime delimitation (judgment)

                     an equitable delimitation, in light of both the geographical context and
                     regional practice. Kenya submits that, even if the Court were to conclude
                     that there is no maritime boundary in place, it should delimit the mari-
                     time areas following the parallel of latitude, and that, even if the Court
                     were to employ the delimitation methodology suggested by Somalia, the
                     outcome, following adjustment to reach an equitable result, would be a
                     delimitation that follows the parallel of latitude (see sketch‑map No. 2
                     below, p. 223, depicting the maritime boundaries claimed by the Parties).
                     


                          III. Whether Somalia Has Acquiesced to a Maritime Boundary
                                      Following the Parallel of Latitude

                       36. The Court will first ascertain whether there is an agreed maritime
                     boundary between the Parties on the basis of acquiescence by Somalia.


                                                         * *
                        37. Kenya maintains that Somalia has acquiesced to its claim that the
                     maritime boundary between the Parties follows the parallel of latitude
                     and that there is thus an agreed boundary between them. According to
                     Kenya, acquiescence requires three elements: first, a course of conduct or
                     omission by one State indicative of its view regarding the content of the
                     applicable legal rule; secondly, another State’s knowledge (actual or con-
                     structive) of such conduct or omission; and, thirdly, a failure by the latter
                     State, when a reaction is called for, to reject or dissociate itself within a
                     reasonable time from the position taken by the first State. Thus, the
                     Respondent’s argument is not that a maritime boundary can result from
                     unilateral acts, but that it can be established by consent resulting from the
                     prolonged absence of protest against a claim. Kenya regards acquiescence
                     as a form of consent that can be equated to tacit agreement. In support of
                     its claim, it invokes decisions by international courts and tribunals refer-
                     ring to acquiescence and tacit agreement.


                        38. Kenya contends that by failing to respond to the Proclamation by
                     the President of the Republic of Kenya of 28 February 1979 (hereinafter
                     the “1979 Proclamation”; see paragraph 54 below), to the Proclamation
                     by the President of the Republic of Kenya of 9 June 2005 (hereinafter the
                     “2005 Proclamation”; see paragraph 61 below) and to Kenya’s Submis-
                     sion on the Continental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles deposited with
                     the CLCS on 6 May 2009 (hereinafter the “2009 Submission to the
                     CLCS”; see paragraph 65 below), Somalia has acquiesced to Kenya’s
                     claim that the maritime boundary between the Parties follows the parallel
                     of latitude. In Kenya’s view, a reaction is called for where there has been

8 Ord_1229.indb 38                                              5/12/22 08:27

                     224 	              maritime delimitation (judgment)

                     an express, official and public notification, through formal United Nations
                     procedures, of a State’s position concerning maritime delimitation and
                     the sovereign rights of adjacent coastal States. It argues that the absence
                     of protest in such circumstances constitutes acquiescence under interna-
                     tional law. The Respondent asserts that if Somalia disagreed with Kenya’s
                     claim, it should have protested promptly, since circumstances such as the
                     proximity of the States concerned and the giving of formal notice call for
                     a quick and, in some cases, immediate response to a maritime or territo-
                     rial claim. According to Kenya, Somalia continued to play an active role
                     in international relations during its civil war; it was represented at the
                     United Nations throughout this period and has had an internationally
                     recognized government since 2000. Kenya argues that Somalia was thus
                     in a position to protest against Kenya’s claim.



                       39. Kenya states that the Applicant’s failure to react immediately to
                     the 1979 Proclamation or the 2005 Proclamation was particularly signifi-
                     cant given that, pursuant to the 1972 Law on the Somali Territorial Sea
                     and Ports, Somalia claimed a territorial sea extending to 200 nautical
                     miles and, therefore, its claim of sovereignty in that area was at stake. In
                     Kenya’s view, Somalia’s acquiescence was made clear by its agreement to
                     the principle of equitable delimitation during the negotiations held at the
                     Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and by its insis-
                     tence on deleting any reference to equidistance in Articles 74 and 83 of
                     UNCLOS, a position that was shared by other African States. Kenya
                     considers it significant that Somalia initiated a rapprochement with
                     Kenya in 1978 and points out that Somalia did not raise the issue of the
                     1979 Proclamation during bilateral meetings held between the Parties in
                     1980 and 1981.

                        40. Kenya also argues that Somalia’s Maritime Law of 1988, which
                     mentions a “straight line” in respect of the territorial sea boundary, refers
                     to the parallel of latitude rather than an equidistance line. In addition,
                     Kenya highlights Somalia’s lack of reaction or protest when, in 2007 and
                     2008, Kenya sent two Notes Verbales in which it stated that it had drawn
                     the boundaries with Somalia “using the parallel of latitude” and requested
                     that Somalia confirm its agreement to such boundaries.
                        41. Kenya considers that the terms of the “Memorandum of Under-
                     standing between the Government of the Republic of Kenya and the
                     Transitional Federal Government of the Somali Republic to grant to
                     each other no‑objection in respect of submissions on the outer limits of
                     the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the
                     Limits of the Continental Shelf” (hereinafter the “MOU”), signed by the
                     Parties in 2009, are consistent with Somalia’s acquiescence. In Kenya’s
                     view, the Court has already found that the MOU does not concern the
                     delimitation of the maritime boundary between the Parties and was





8 Ord_1229.indb 40                                                                                   5/12/22 08:27

                     225 	              maritime delimitation (judgment)

                     intended merely to allow them to make their CLCS submissions before
                     the relevant deadline. It adds that the reference in the MOU to an unset-
                     tled maritime boundary “dispute” concerns only the delimitation of the
                     outer continental shelf and simply recognizes that the Parties have not yet
                     negotiated a formal agreement.

                       42. Kenya contends that a letter sent by the Prime Minister of Somalia
                     to the Secretary‑General of the United Nations on 19 August 2009 did
                     not contain a claim to an “equidistant maritime boundary” or a protest
                     against Kenya’s maritime boundary claim. It asserts that Somalia’s first
