                           1. I have accompanied the majority in voting in favour of the adoption
                      today, 16 December 2015, of the present Judgment of the International
                      Court of Justice (ICJ) in the two joined cases of Certain Activities
                      ­Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)
                       and of the Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River
                      (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica). Yet, there are certain points ensuing from the
                      Court’s decision which, though not dwelt upon at depth by the Court in
                      its reasoning, are in my view endowed with importance, related as they
                      are to the proper exercise of the international judicial function. I feel thus
                      obliged to dwell upon them, in the present separate opinion, nourishing
                      the hope that the considerations that follow may be useful for the han-
                       dling of this matter by the ICJ in future cases.
                           2. I start drawing attention to the manifestations, in the cas d’espèce, of
                       the preventive dimension in contemporary international law. I then turn
                       attention to the key point, which I have been sustaining in the adjudica-
                       tion of successive cases in this Court, namely, that of the conformation of
                       the autonomous legal regime of provisional measures of protection, in the
                       course of their evolution (after their transposition from comparative
                       domestic procedural law into international law). Next, I consider the
                       ­widening of the scope of protection by means of provisional measures, and
                        the breach of these latter as an autonomous breach, engaging State respon-
                        sibility by itself. I then proceed to examine the determination by the ICJ of
                        breaches of obligations under provisional measures of protection.
                           3. In sequence, I present a plea for the prompt determination by the
                        Court of breaches of provisional measures of protection. My next line of
                        consideration is on the supervision of compliance with provisional mea-
                        sures of protection. Following that, I examine the interrelationship
                        between the breach of provisional measures and the duty of reparation
                        (in its distinct forms) for damages. I then turn attention to due diligence,
                        and the interrelatedness between the principle of prevention and the pre-
                        cautionary principle. Next, I purport to detect the path towards the pro-
                        gressive development of provisional measures of protection. Last but not
                        least, I present, in an epilogue, my final considerations on the matter, in
                        the form of a recapitulation of the main points sustained herein, in the
                        course of the present separate opinion.

                         4. May I begin by observing that the two joined cases of Certain Activ‑
                      ities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area and of the Construction
                      of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River bring to the fore the
                      relevance of the preventive dimension in contemporary international law,
                      as reflected in the present Judgment, of 16 December 2015, in the finding

                      760 	certain activities and construction of a road (sep. op. cançado trindade)

                       and legal consequences of breaches of provisional measures of protection
                       (in the Certain Activities case), as well as in the acknowledgment of the
                       obligation of conducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA) (in
                       the Construction of a Road case as well). This preventive dimension grows
                       in importance in the framework of regimes of protection (such as those,
                       e.g., of the human person, and of the environment). Moreover, it brings
                       us particularly close to general principles of law. Such preventive dimen-
                       sion stands out clearly in the succession of the Court’s Orders of provi-
                       sional measures of protection of 8 March 2011, 16 July 2013 and
                       22 November 2013 1.
                          5. The question of the non‑compliance with, or of breaches of, the
                       aforementioned Orders of provisional measures of protection, was care-
                       fully addressed by the two contending Parties in the course not only of
                       the Court’s proceedings pertaining to such Orders 2, but also in the
                       course of its proceedings (written and oral phases) as to the merits of the
                       Certain Activities case. Concern with the issue of non‑compliance with, or
                       breaches of the Court’s Order of 8 March 2011, for example, was in effect
                       expressed in Costa Rica’s Memorial 3 — a whole chapter — as well as in
                       its oral arguments 4; Nicaragua, likewise, devoted a chapter of its
                      ­Counter‑Memorial 5, as well as its oral arguments 6, to the issue. The
                       same concern was expressed, in respect of the Court’s subsequent Order
                       on provisional measures of 16 July 2013 — and of events following it —
                       in the oral arguments of Costa Rica 7 and of Nicaragua 8. Again, in respect
                       of the Court’s third Order on provisional measures, of 22 November
                       2013, reference can further be made to the oral arguments of both
                       Costa Rica 9 and Nicaragua 10.



                                  III. The Autonomous Legal Regime of Provisional
                                               Measures of Protection

                        6. The autonomous legal regime of provisional measures of protection
                      has been quite discernible to me : I have been drawing attention to it, in
                           Reference can further be made to the Court’s subsequent Order of 13 December 2013.

                      the way I conceive such autonomous legal regime, in successive dissenting
                      and individual opinions in this Court. The present Judgment of the ICJ in
                      the two joined cases of Certain Activities and of the Construction of a
                      Road is a proper occasion to dwell further upon it. The Court has duly
                      considered the submissions of the Parties, Costa Rica and Nicaragua
                      (Judgment, paras. 121‑129), and has found that the respondent State
                      incurred into a breach of the obligations under its Order on provisional
                      measures of protection of 8 March 2011 by the excavation of two caños
                      in 2013 and the establishment of a military presence in the disputed terri-
                      tory (ibid., paras. 127 and 129, and resolutory point No. 3 of the disposi‑
                      tif). The ICJ has pointed out that the respondent State itself had
                      acknowledged, in the course of the oral hearings, that “the excavation of
                      the second and third caños represented an infringement of its obligations
                      under the 2011 Order” (ibid., para. 125) 11.

                                  1. The Evolution of Provisional Measures of Protection
                         7. There are, as from this finding of the Court of a breach of provisio-
                      nal measures in the cas d’espèce, several points that come to my mind, all
                      relating to what I have been conceptualizing, along the years, as the auto-
                      nomous legal regime of provisional measures of protection 12. This regime
                      can be better appreciated if we consider provisional measures in their his-
                      torical evolution. May I recall that, in their origins, in domestic procedu-

                      telar), aiming at guaranteeing, not directly subjective rights per se, but
                      rather the jurisdictional process itself. They had not yet freed themselves
                         11 In the oral hearing of 16 April 2015, the Agent of the respondent State asserted that

                      “Nicaragua deeply regrets the actions following the 2011 Order on provisional measures
                      that led the Court to determine, in November 2013, that a new Order was required” ;
                      CR 2015/5, of 16 April 2015, p. 8, para. 42. On the following day counsel recalled this
                      (CR 2015/7, of 17 April 2015, p. 45, para. 14), and again it did so in the hearing of 29 April
                      2015, adding that there was thus “no need for future remedial measures” ; CR 2015/15, of
                      29 April 2015, p. 44, paras. 23-24.

                      from a certain juridical formalism, conveying the impression of taking the
                      legal process as an end in itself, rather than as a means for the realization
                      of justice. With the gradual transposition of provisional measures from
                      domestic into international law level, they came to be increasingly resorted
                      to, in face of the most diverse circumstances disclosing the probability or
                      imminence of an irreparable damage, to be prevented or avoided.

                         9. Their transposition into international legal procedure, and the

                      tion (e.g., of the human person or of the environment), had the effect, in
                      my perception, of enlarging the scope of international jurisdiction, and of
                      refining their conceptualization. International case law on provisional
                      measures of protection expanded considerably over the last three decades,
                      making it clear to the contending parties that they are to abstain from
                      any action which may aggravate the dispute pendente lite, or may have a
                      prejudicial effect on the compliance with the subsequent judgment as to
                      the merits.
                         10. Their rationale stood out clearer, turning to the protection of
                      rights, of the equality of arms (égalité des armes), and not only of the
                      legal process itself. Over the last three decades, provisional measures of
                      protection have freed themselves from the juridical formalism of the pro-
                      cedural doctrine of over a century ago, and have, in my perception, come
                      closer to reaching their plenitude. They have become endowed with a
                      character, more than precautionary, truly tutelary. When their basic req-
                      uisites — of gravity and urgency, and the needed prevention of irrepara-
                      ble harm — are met, they have been ordered, in the light of the needs of
                      protection, and have thus conformed a true jurisdictional guarantee of a
                      preventive character.

                      recall but one example, already by the turn of the century, in another
                      international jurisdiction, in my concurring opinion appended to the
                      Order of 25 May 1999 of the Inter‑American Court of Human Rights
                      (IACtHR) in the case of James et al., concerning Trinidad and Tobago, I
                      deemed it fit to draw attention to the configuration, in provisional mea-
                      sures of protection of our times, of a true jurisdictional guarantee of a
                      preventive character (para. 10). I further drew attention to the inherent

                      provisional measures that it decided to order (para. 7). All this comes to
                      reinforce the preventive dimension, proper of those measures.

                         12. In the case of the ICJ (like in that of the IACtHR), such provi-
                      sional measures do have a conventional basis (Article 41 of the ICJ’s Stat-
                      ute). But even if an international tribunal does not count on such a
                      conventional basis, it has, in my understanding, inherent powers to indi-
                      cate such measures, so as to secure the sound administration of justice (la
                      bonne administration de la justice). Contemporary international tribunals
                      have the compétence de la compétence (Kompetenz‑Kompetenz) in the





5 Ord 1088.indb 198                                                                                    19/10/16 12:01

                      domain of provisional measures as well, so as to safeguard the respective

                      grant of those measures is a significant manifestation of the preventive
                      dimension in contemporary international law.

                              2. The Conformation of Their Autonomous Legal Regime
                         13. In effect, the evolution of provisional measures in recent years has,
                      in my perception, made very clear that they operate within an autono-
                      mous legal regime of their own, encompassing their juridical nature, the
                      rights and obligations at issue, their legal effects, and the duty of compli-
                      ance with them. It is now the duty of contemporary international tribu-
                      nals to elaborate on such autonomous legal regime, and to extract the
                      legal consequences ensuing therefrom. In order to do so, it is necessary, in
                      my understanding, to keep in mind — may I reiterate — their juridical
                      nature, the rights to be preserved and the corresponding obligations in
                      their wide scope, and their legal effects (cf. infra).

                      the case of Questions Relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite
                      (Belgium v. Senegal), wherein the Court decided not to indicate or order
                      provisional measures, I pondered that provisional measures of protection
                      have lately much evolved, and appear nowadays as being “endowed with
                      a character, more than precautionary, truly tutelary” (I.C.J. Reports
                      2009, p. 170, para. 13). Their development — I added — has led the
                      Court gradually to overcome the strictly inter‑State outlook in the
                      acknowledgment of the rights to be preserved (ibid., p. 174, para. 21,
                      p. 175, para. 25 and p. 190, para. 72). Such rights to be protected by pro-
                      visional measures have encompassed, in the cas d’espèce, the right to the
                      realization of justice, — i.e., the right to see to it that justice is done, —
                      “ineluctably linked to the rule of law at both national and international
                      levels” (ibid., pp. 196‑197, paras. 92‑95 and p. 199, para. 101).

                         15. Four years later, in my dissenting opinion in the Court’s Order
                      (of 16 July 2013) in the joined cases of Certain Activities Carried Out by
                      Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction
                      of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v.
                      Costa Rica), wherein the Court simply reaffirmed a previous Order
                      (of 8 March 2011) and decided not to indicate or order new provisional
                      measures or modify the previous Order, I drew attention to the overcom-
                      ing of the inter‑State outlook in the present domain of provisional mea-
                      sures (I.C.J. Reports 2013, p. 261, para. 49), given that they came to
                      extend protection also to the human person (ibid., pp. 257‑258,
                      paras. 39‑42). I further warned that non‑compliance with provisional
                      measures of protection amounts to a breach of an international obliga-
                      tion, engaging State responsibility per se (ibid., p. 267‑268, paras. 70‑72).
                      Provisional measures have an autonomous legal regime of their own, I
                      concluded, and they have grown in importance — with their preventive

                      dimension underlined by their juridical nature — “in respect of regimes of
                      protection, such as those of the human person as well as of the environ-
                      ment” (I.C.J. Reports 2013, pp. 268‑269, paras. 73 and 75).

                         16. Shortly afterwards, in my subsequent separate opinion in the
                      Court’s following Order on provisional measures (of 22 November 2013)
                      in the same two joined cases opposing the two Central American coun-
                      tries, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, wherein the Court decided to indicate or
                      order new provisional measures, I observed that the duty of compliance
                      with provisional measures of protection outlines their autonomous legal
                      regime (ibid., pp. 379‑380, paras. 23‑24). Provisional measures — I pro-
                      ceeded — generate per se obligations, irrespective of, or independently
                      from, those ensuing from the Court’s Judgments on the merits or on rep-
                      arations (ibid., pp. 382‑383, para. 29). I insisted that provisional measures
                      of protection, in their evolution, have become, more than precautionary,
                      truly tutelary (ibid., p. 381, para. 26), and I then added, moving into their
                      effects, that non‑compliance with provisional measures of protection
                      engages autonomously the international responsibility of the State (ibid.,
                      p. 380, para. 24 and p. 387, paras. 39‑40). Such non‑compliance is “an
                      autonomous breach of a conventional obligation (concerning provisional
                      measures), without prejudice to what will later be decided by the Court as
                      to the merits” (ibid., p. 386, para. 37).


                                   IV. Provisional Measures : The Enlargement
                                           of the Scope of Protection

                         17. In the present Judgment in the two joined cases of Certain Activi‑
                      ties and of the Construction of a Road, the Court has found, in Sec-
                      tion III.C concerning the Certain Activities case, that the excavation of
                      the second and the third caños and the establishment of a military pres-
                      ence in the disputed territory breached the obligations of the provisional
                      measures of protection it had ordered (on 8 March 2011), and constituted
                      “a violation of the territorial sovereignty” of the applicant State (Judg-
                      ment, para. 129). Beyond that, provisional measures, in my perception,
                      do widen the scope of protection ; it is not only a matter of State sover-
                      eignty. Protection extends to the environment, and the right to life ; their
