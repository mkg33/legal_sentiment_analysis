The Court finds in this Judgment that the Australian claim ‘‘no longer
has any object and that” it “is therefore not called upon to give a decision
thereon”.

That the Australian claim was without object was apparent to me
from the very first, and not merely subsequent to the recent French
statements: in my view it lacked object ab initio, and radically.

The recent French statements adduced in the reasoning of the Judgment
do no more than supplement (to useful purpose, I admit) what I con-
ceived to be the legal arguments for removal of the case from the Court’s
list. But there would be no point in rehearsing these arguments now that
the proceedings are over.

I wish, finally, to state in terms that I personally have noted nothing in
the French statements which could be interpreted as an admission of any
breach of positive international law; neither have I observed in them
anything whatever bearing any resemblance to a concession wrested from
France by means of the judicial proceedings and implying the least
abandonment of that absolute sovereignty which France, like any other
State, possesses in the domain of its national defence.
