the pleadings and documents annexed would be made available to the public as
from the opening of the oral proceedings.

10. By a letter dated 16 June 1995, the Agent of Slovakia invited the Court



to visit the locality to which the case relates and there to exercise its functions
with regard to the obtaining of evidence, in accordance with Article 66 of the
Rules of Court. For his part, the Agent of Hungary indicated, by a letter dated
28 June 1995, that, if the Court should decide that a visit of that kind would be
useful, his Government would be pleased to co-operate in organizing it. By a
letter dated 14 November 1995, the Agents of the Parties jointly notified to the
Court the text of a Protocol of Agreement, concluded in Budapest and New
York the same day, with a view to proposing to the Court the arrangements
that might be made for such a visit in situ; and, by a letter dated 3 February
1997, they jointly notified to it the text of Agreed Minutes drawn up in Buda-
pest and New York the same day, which supplemented the Protocol of Agree-
ment of 14 November 1995. By an Order dated 5 February 1997, the Court
decided to accept the invitation to exercise its functions with regard to the
obtaining of evidence at a place to which the case relates and, to that end, to
adopt the arrangements proposed by the Parties. The Court visited the area
from 1 to 4 April 1997; it visited a number of locations along the Danube and
took note of the technical explanations given by the representatives who had
been designated for the purpose by the Parties.

11. The Court held a first round of ten public hearings from 3 to 7 March
and from 24 to 27 March 1997, and a second round of four public hearings on
10, 11, 14 and 15 April 1997, after having made the visit in siru referred to in
the previous paragraph. During those hearings, the Court heard the oral argu-
ments and replies of:

For Hungary: HE. Mr. Szénasi,
Professor Valki,
Professor Kiss,
Professor Vida,
Professor Carbiener,
Professor Crawford,
Professor Nagy,

Dr. Kern,
Professor Wheater,
Ms Gorove,
Professor Dupuy,
Professor Sands.

For Slovakia: H.E. Dr. Tomka,
Dr. Mikulka,
Mr. Wordsworth,
Professor McCaffrey,
Professor Mucha,
Professor Pellet,
Mr. Refsgaard,
Sir Arthur Watts.

12. The Parties replied orally and in writing to various questions put by
Members of the Court. Referring to the provisions of Article 72 of the Rules of
Court, each of the Parties submitted to the Court its comments upon the replies
given by the other Party to some of those questions.



13. In the course of the written proceedings, the following submissions were

presented by the Parties:

On behalf of Hungary,

15. The present case arose out of the signature, on 16 September 1977,
by the Hungarian People’s Republic and the Czechoslovak People’s
Republic, of a treaty “concerning the construction and operation of the
Gabtikovo-Nagymaros System of Locks” (hereinafter called the “1977
Treaty”). The names of the two contracting States have varied over the
years; hereinafter they will be referred to as Hungary and Czechoslo-
vakia. The 1977 Treaty entered into force on 30 June 1978.

It provides for the construction and operation of a System of Locks by
the parties as a “joint investment”. According to its Preamble, the bar-
rage system was designed to attain

“the broad utilization of the natural resources of the Bratislava-
Budapest section of the Danube river for the development of water



resources, energy, transport, agriculture and other sectors of the
national economy of the Contracting Parties”.

The joint investment was thus essentially aimed at the production of
hydroelectricity, the improvement of navigation on the relevant sec-
tion of the Danube and the protection of the areas along the banks
against flooding. At the same time, by the terms of the Treaty, the con-
tracting parties undertook to ensure that the quality of water in the Dan-
ube was not impaired as a result of the Project, and that compliance with
the obligations for the protection of nature arising in connection with the
construction and operation of the System of Locks would be observed.
16. The Danube is the second longest river in Europe, flowing along or
across the borders of nine countries in its 2,860-kilometre course from the
Black Forest eastwards to the Black Sea. For 142 kilometres, it forms the
boundary between Slovakia and Hungary. The sector with which this
case is concerned is a stretch of approximately 200 kilometres, between
Bratislava in Slovakia and Budapest in Hungary. Below Bratislava, the
river gradient decreases markedly, creating an alluvial plain of gravel and
sand sediment. This plain is delimited to the north-east, in Slovak terri-
tory, by the Maly Danube and to the south-west, in Hungarian territory,
by the Mosoni Danube. The boundary between the two States is consti-
tuted, in the major part of that region, by the main channel of the river.
The area lying between the Maly Danube and that channel, in Slovak
territory, constitutes the Zitny Ostrov; the area between the main chan-
nel and the Mosoni Danube, in Hungarian territory, constitutes the
Szigetkôz. Cunovo and, further downstream, Gabtikovo, are situated in
this sector of the river on Slovak territory, Cunovo on the right bank and
Gabéëikovo on the left. Further downstream, after the confluence of the
various branches, the river enters Hungarian territory and the topo-
graphy becomes hillier. Nagymaros lies in a narrow valley at a bend in the
Danube just before it turns south, enclosing the large river island of Szen-
tendre before reaching Budapest (see sketch-map No. 1, p. 19 below).

17. The Danube has always played a vital part in the commercial and
economic development of its riparian States, and has underlined and
reinforced their interdependence, making international co-operation
essential. Improvements to the navigation channel have enabled the Dan-
ube, now linked by canal to the Main and thence to the Rhine, to become
an important navigational artery connecting the North Sea to the Black
Sea. In the stretch of river to which the case relates, flood protection
measures have been constructed over the centuries, farming and forestry
practised, and, more recently, there has been an increase in population
and industrial activity in the area. The cumulative effects on the river and
on the environment of various human activities over the years have not
all been favourable, particularly for the water régime.

Only by international co-operation could action be taken to alleviate
these problems. Water management projects along the Danube have fre-
quently sought to combine navigational improvements and flood protec-
tion with the production of electricity through hydroelectric power plants.
The potential of the Danube for the production of hydroelectric power
has been extensively exploited by some riparian States. The history of
attempts to harness the potential of the particular stretch of the river at
issue in these proceedings extends over a 25-year period culminating in
the signature of the 1977 Treaty.

18. Article 1, paragraph 1, of the 1977 Treaty describes the principal
works to be constructed in pursuance of the Project. It provided for the
building of two series of locks, one at Gabtikovo (in Czechoslovak ter-
ritory) and the other at Nagymaros (in Hungarian territory), to consti-
tute “a single and indivisible operational system of works” (see sketch-
map No. 2, p. 21 below). The Court will subsequently have occasion to
revert in more detail to those works, which were to comprise, inter alia, a
reservoir upstream of Dunakiliti, in Hungarian and Czechoslovak terri-
tory; a dam at Dunakiliti, in Hungarian territory; a bypass canal, in
Czechoslovak territory, on which was to be constructed the Gabéikovo
System of Locks (together with a hydroelectric power plant with an
installed capacity of 720 megawatts (MW)); the deepening of the bed of
the Danube downstream of the place at which the bypass canal was to
rejoin the old bed of the river; a reinforcement of flood-control works
along the Danube upstream of Nagymaros; the Nagymaros System of
Locks, in Hungarian territory (with a hydroelectric power plant of a
capacity of 158 MW); and the deepening of the bed of the Danube down-
stream.

Article |, paragraph 4, of the Treaty further provided that the techni-
cal specifications concerning the system would be included in the “Joint
Contractual Plan” which was to be drawn up in accordance with the
Agreement signed by the two Governments for this purpose on 6 May
1976; Article 4, paragraph 1, for its part, specified that “the joint invest-
ment [would] be carried out in conformity with the joint contractual
plan”.

According to Article 3, paragraph 1:

“Operations connected with the realization of the joint investment
and with the performance of tasks relating to the operation of the
System of Locks shall be directed and supervised by the Govern-
ments of the Contracting Parties through . . . (. . . ‘government
delegates’).”

Those delegates had, inter alia, “to ensure that construction of the Sys-
tem of Locks is . . . carried out in accordance with the approved joint
contractual plan and the project work schedule”. When the works were
brought into operation, they were moreover “To establish the operating

ance therewith.”
Article 4, paragraph 4, stipulated that:

“Operations relating to the joint investment [should] be organized
by the Contracting Parties in such a way that the power generation
plants [would] be put into service during the period 1986-1990.”

Article 5 provided that the cost of the joint investment would be borne
by the contracting parties in equal measure. It specified the work to be
carried out by each one of them. Article 8 further stipulated that the
Dunakiliti dam, the bypass canal and the two series of locks at Gab-
tikovo and Nagymaros would be “jointly owned” by the contracting
parties “in equal measure”. Ownership of the other works was to be
vested in the State on whose territory they were constructed.

The parties were likewise to participate in equal measure in the use of
the system put in place, and more particularly in the use of the base-load
and peak-load power generated at ,the hydroelectric power plants
(Art. 9).

According to Article 10, the works were to be managed by the State on
whose territory they were located, “in accordance with the jointly-agreed
operating and operational procedures”, while Article 12 stipulated that
the operation, maintenance (repair) and reconstruction costs of jointly
- owned works of the System of Locks were also to be borne jointly by the
contracting parties in equal measure.

According to Article 14,

“The discharge specified in the water balance of the approved
joint contractual plan shall be ensured in the bed of the Danube
[between Dunakiliti and Sap] unless natural conditions or other cir-
cumstances temporarily require a greater or smaller discharge.”

Paragraph 3 of that Article was worded as follows:

“In the event that the withdrawal of water in the Hungarian-
Czechoslovak section of the Danube exceeds the quantities of water
specified in the water balance of the approved joint contractual plan
and the excess withdrawal results in a decrease in the output of
electric power, the share of electric power of the Contracting Party
benefiting from the excess withdrawal shall be correspondingly
reduced.”

Article 15 specified that the contracting parties

“shall ensure, by the means specified in the joint contractual plan,
that the quality of the water in the Danube is not impaired as a
result of the construction and operation of the System of Locks”.



Article 16 set forth the obligations of the contracting parties concern-
ing the maintenance of the bed of the Danube.
Article 18, paragraph 1, provided as follows:

“The Contracting Parties, in conformity with the obligations pre-
viously assumed by them, and in particular with article 3 of the Con-
vention concerning the regime of navigation on the Danube, signed
at Belgrade on 18 August 1948, shall ensure uninterrupted and safe
navigation on the international fairway both during the construction
and during the operation of the System of Locks.”

It was stipulated in Article 19 that:

“The Contracting Parties shall, through the means specified in the
joint contractual plan, ensure compliance with the obligations for
the protection of nature arising in connection with the construction
and operation of the System of Locks.”

Article 20 provided for the contracting parties to take appropriate
measures, within the framework of their national investments, for the
protection of fishing interests in conformity with the Convention con-
cerning Fishing in the Waters of the Danube, signed at Bucharest on
29 January 1958.

According to Article 22, paragraph 1, of the Treaty, the contracting
parties had, in connection with the construction and operation of the
System of Locks, agreed on minor revision to the course of the State
frontier between them as follows:

“(d) In the Dunakiliti-Hruäov head-water area, the State frontier
shall run from boundary point 161.V.0.4. to boundary stone
No. LS. in a straight line in such a way that the territories
affected, to the extent of about 10-10 hectares shall be offset
between the two States.”

It was further provided, in paragraph 2, that the revision of the State
frontier and the exchange of territories so provided for should be effected
“by the Contracting Parties on the basis of a separate treaty”. No such
treaty was concluded.

Finally a dispute settlement provision was contained in Article 27,
worded as follows:

“1. The settlement of disputes in matters relating to the realiza-
tion and operation of the System of Locks shall be a function of the
government delegates.

2. If the government delegates are unable to reach agreement on
the matters in dispute, they shall refer them to the Governments of
the Contracting Parties for decision.”

19. The Joint Contractual Plan, referred to in the previous paragraph,
set forth, on a large number of points, both the objectives of the system



and the characteristics of the works. In its latest version it specified in
paragraph 6.2 that the Gabéikovo bypass canal would have a discharge
capacity of 4,000 cubic metres per second (m?/s). The power plant would
include “Eight . . . turbines with 9.20 m diameter running wheels” and
would “mainly operate in peak-load time and continuously during high
water”. This type of operation would give an energy production of
2,650 gigawatt/hours (GWh) per annum. The Plan further stipulated in
paragraph 4.4.2:

“The low waters are stored every day, which ensures the peak-
load time operation of the Gabëikovo hydropower plant . . . a mini-
mum of 50 m“/s additional water is provided for the old bed [of the
Danube] besides the water supply of the branch system.”

The Plan further specified that, in the event that the discharge into the
bypass canal exceeded 4,000-4,500 m?/s, the excess amounts of water
would be channelled into the old bed. Lastly, according to paragraph 7.7
of the Plan:

“The common operational regulation stipulates that concerning the
operation of the Dunakiliti barrage in the event of need during the
growing season 200 m“/s discharge must be released into the old Dan-
ube bed, in addition to the occasional possibilities for rinsing the bed.”

The Joint Contractual Plan also contained “Preliminary Operating and
Maintenance Rules”, Article 23 of which specified that “The final oper-
ating rules [should] be approved within a year of the setting into opera-
tion of the system.” (Joint Contractual Plan, Summary Documentation,
Vol. O-1-A.)

Nagymaros, with six turbines, was, according to paragraph 6.3 of
the Plan, to be a “hydropower station . . . type of a basic power-station
capable of operating in peak-load time for five hours at the discharge
interval between 1,000-2,500 m°/s” per day. The intended annual produc-

. tion was to be 1,025 GWh (i.e., 38 per cent of the production of Gabèikovo,
for an installed power only equal to 21 per cent of that of Gabtikovo).

20. Thus, the Project was to have taken the form of an integrated joint
project with the two contracting parties on an equal footing in respect of
the financing, construction and operation of the works. Its single and
indivisible nature was to have been realized through the Joint Contrac-
tual Plan which complemented the Treaty. In particular, Hungary would
have had control of the sluices at Dunakiliti and the works at Nagy-
maros, whereas Czechoslovakia would have had control of the works at
Gabtikovo.

*

21. The schedule of work had for its part been fixed in an Agreement
on mutual assistance signed by the two parties on 16 September 1977, at



the same time as the Treaty itself. The Agreement moreover made some
adjustments to the allocation of the works between the parties as laid
down by the Treaty.

Work on the Project started in 1978. On Hungary's initiative, the two
parties first agreed, by two Protocols signed on 10 October 1983 (one
amending Article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1977 Treaty and the other the
Agreement on mutual assistance), to slow the work down and to post-
pone putting into operation the power plants, and then, by a Protocol
signed on 6 February 1989 (which amended the Agreement on mutual
assistance), to accelerate the Project.

22. As a result of intense criticism which the Project had generated in
Hungary, the Hungarian Government decided on 13 May 1989 to sus-
pend the works at Nagymaros pending the completion of various studies
which the competent authorities were to finish before 31 July 1989. On
21 July 1989, the Hungarian Government extended the suspension of the
works at Nagymaros until 31 October 1989, and, in addition, suspended
the works at Dunakiliti until the same date. Lastly, on 27 October 1989,
Hungary decided to abandon the works at Nagymaros and to maintain
the status quo at Dunakiliti.

23. During this period, negotiations were being held between the
parties. Czechoslovakia also started investigating alternative solutions.
One of them, subsequently known as “Variant C”, entailed a unilateral
diversion of the Danube by Czechoslovakia on its territory some 10 kilo-
metres upstream of Dunakiliti (see sketch-map No. 3, p. 26 below). In its
final stage, Variant C included the construction at Cunovo of an overflow
dam and a levee linking that dam to the south bank of the bypass canal.
The corresponding reservoir was to have a smaller surface area and pro-
vide approximately 30 per cent less storage than the reservoir initially
contemplated. Provision was made for ancillary works, namely: an intake
structure to supply the Mosoni Danube; a weir to enable, inter alia,
floodwater to be directed along the old bed of the Danube; an auxiliary
shiplock; and two hydroelectric power plants (one capable of an annual
production of 4 GWh on the Mosoni Danube, and the other with a pro-
duction of 174 GWh on the old bed of the Danube). The supply of water
to the side-arms of the Danube on the Czechoslovak bank was to be
secured by means of two intake structures in the bypass canal at
Dobrohoëst’ and Gabtikovo. A solution was to be found for the Hungar-
ian bank. Moreover, the question of the deepening of the bed of the Dan-
ube at the confluence of the bypass canal and the old bed of the river
remained outstanding.

On 23 July 1991, the Slovak Government decided “to begin, in Sep-
tember 1991, construction to put the Gabcikovo Project into operation
by the provisional solution”. That decision was endorsed by the Federal
Czechoslovak Government on 25 July. Work on Variant C began
in November 1991. Discussions continued between the two parties but to
no avail, and, on 19 May 1992, the Hungarian Government transmitted

“In order to provide reliable and undisputed data on the most
important effects of the current water discharge and the remedial
measures already undertaken as well as to make recommendations
for appropriate measures.”

On | December 1993, the experts designated by the Commission of the
European Communities recommended the adoption of various measures
to remedy the situation on a temporary basis. The Parties were unable to
agree on these recommendations. After lengthy negotiations, they finally
concluded an Agreement “concerning Certain Temporary Technical Meas-
ures and Discharges in the Danube and Mosoni branch of the Danube”,



on 19 April 1995. That Agreement raised the discharge of water into the
Mosoni Danube to 43 m/s. It provided for an annual average of 400 m*/s
in the old bed (not including flood waters). Lastly, it provided for the con-
struction by Hungary of a partially underwater weir near to Dunakiliti
with a view to improving the water supply to the side-arms of the Danube
on the Hungarian side. It was specified that this temporary agreement
would come to an end 14 days after the Judgment of the Court.

26. The first subparagraph of the Preamble to the Special Agreement
covers the disputes arising between Czechoslovakia and Hungary con-
cerning the application and termination, not only of the 1977 Treaty, but
also of “related instruments”; the subparagraph specifies that, for the
purposes of the Special Agreement, the 1977 Treaty and the said instru-
ments shall be referred to as “the Treaty”. “The Treaty” is expressly
referred to in the wording of the questions submitted to the Court in
Article 2, paragraph |, subparagraphs (a) and (cj, of the Special
Agreement.

The Special Agreement however does not define the concept of “related
instruments”, nor does it list them. As for the Parties, they gave some
consideration to that question — essentially in the written proceedings —
without reaching agreement as to the exact meaning of the expression or
as to the actual instruments referred to. The Court notes however that
the Parties seemed to agree to consider that that expression covers at
least the instruments linked to the 1977 Treaty which implement it, such
as the Agreement on mutual assistance of 16 September 1977 and its
amending Protocols dated, respectively, 10 October 1983 and 6 February
1989 (see paragraph 21 above), and the Agreement as to the common
operational regulations of Plenipotentiaries fulfilling duties related to the
construction and operation of the Gabtikovo-Nagymaros Barrage Sys-
tem signed in Bratislava on 11 October 1979. The Court notes that Hun-
gary, unlike Slovakia, declined to apply the description of related instru-
ments to the 1977 Treaty to the Joint Contractual Plan (see paragraph 19
above), which it refused to see as “an agreement at the same level as the
other . . . related Treaties and inter-State agreements”.

Lastly the Court notes that the Parties, in setting out the replies which
should in their view be given to the questions put in the Special Agree-
ment, concentrated their reasoning on the 1977 Treaty; and that they
would appear to have extended their arguments to “related instruments”
in considering them as accessories to a whole treaty system, whose fate
was in principle linked to that of the main part, the 1977 Treaty. The
Court takes note of the positions of the Parties and considers that it does
not need to go into this matter further at this juncture.

27. The Court will now turn to a consideration of the questions
submitted by the Parties. In terms of Article 2, paragraph 1 (a), of the
Special Agreement, the Court is requested to decide first

and on the part of the Gabèikovo Project for which the Treaty
attributed responsibility to the Republic of Hungary”.

28. The Court would recall that the Gab¢ikovo-Nagymaros System of
Locks is characterized in Article |, paragraph 1, of the 1977 Treaty as a
“single and indivisible operational system of works”.

The principal works which were to constitute this system have been
described in general terms above (see paragraph 18). Details of them are
given in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 1 of the Treaty.

For Gabcikovo, paragraph 2 lists the following works:

“(a) the Dunakiliti-Hrusov head-water installations in the Danube
sector at r.km. (river kilometre(s)) 1860-1842, designed for a
maximum flood stage of 131.10 m.B. (metres above sea-level,
Baltic system), in Hungarian and Czechoslovak territory;

(b) the Dunakiliti dam and auxiliary navigation lock at r.km.
1842, in Hungarian territory;

(¢) the by-pass canal (head-water canal and tail-water canal) at
r.km. 1842-1811, in Czechoslovak territory;

(d) series of locks on the by-pass canal, in Czechoslovak territory,
consisting of a hydroelectric power plant with installed capa-
city of 720 MW, double navigation locks and appurtenances
thereto;

(e) improved old bed of the Danube at r.km. 1842-1811, in the
joint Hungarian-Czechoslovak section;

(f) deepened and regulated bed of the Danube at r.km. 1811-
1791, in the joint Hungarian-Czechoslovak section.”

For Nagymaros, paragraph 3 specifies the following works:

“(a) head-water installations and flood-control works in the

29. Moreover, the precise breakdown of the works incumbent on each
party was set out in Article 5, paragraph 5, of the 1977 Treaty, as fol-
lows:

30. As the Court has already indicated (see paragraph 18 above), Ar-
ticle 1, paragraph 4, of the 1977 Treaty stipulated in general terms that
the “technical specifications” concerning the System of Locks would be
included in the “joint contractual plan”. The schedule of work had for its
part been fixed in an Agreement on mutual assistance signed by the two
parties on 16 September 1977 (see paragraph 21 above). In accordance
with the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 1, of that Agreement, the
whole of the works of the barrage system were to have been completed in
1991. As indicated in paragraph 2 of that same article, a summary con-
struction schedule was appended to the Agreement, and provision was
made for a more detailed schedule to be worked out in the Joint Con-
tractual Plan. The Agreement of 16 September 1977 was twice amended
further. By a Protocol signed on 10 October 1983, the parties agreed first
to postpone the works and the putting into operation of the power plants
for four more years; then, by a Protocol signed on 6 February 1989, the
parties decided, conversely, to bring them forward by 15 months, the
whole system having to be operational in 1994. À new summary con-
struction schedule was appended to each of those Protocols; those sched-
ules were in turn to be implemented by means of new detailed schedules,
included in the Joint Contractual Plan.

31. In spring 1989, the work on the Gabtikovo sector was well
advanced: the Dunakiliti dam was 90 per cent complete, the Gabéikovo
dam was 85 per cent complete, and the bypass canal was between 60 per
cent complete (downstream of Gabétikovo) and 95 per cent complete
(upstream of Gabtikovo) and the dykes of the Dunakiliti-Hrusov reser-
voir were between 70 and 98 per cent complete, depending on the loca-
tion. This was not the case in the Nagymaros sector where, although
dykes had been built, the only structure relating to the dam itself was the
coffer-dam which was to facilitate its construction.

32. In the wake of the profound political and economic changes which
occurred at this time in central Europe, the Gabtikovo-Nagymaros
Project was the object, in Czechoslovakia and more particularly in Hun-
gary, of increasing apprehension, both within a section of public opinion
and in some scientific circles. The uncertainties not only about the eco-
nomic viability of the Project, but also, and more so, as to the guarantees
it offered for preservation of the environment, engendered a climate of
growing concern and opposition with regard to the Project.

33. It was against this background that, on 13 May 1989, the Govern-
ment of Hungary adopted a resolution to suspend works at Nagymaros,
and ordered

“the Ministers concerned to commission further studies in order to
place the Council of Ministers in a position where it can make well-
founded suggestions to the Parliament in connection with the amend-
ment of the international treaty on the investment. In the interests of



the above, we must examine the international and legal conse-
quences, the technical considerations, the obligations related to con-
tinuous navigation on the Danube and the environmental/ecological
and seismic impacts of the eventual stopping of the Nagymaros
investment. To be further examined are the opportunities for the
replacement of the lost electric energy and the procedures for mini-
mising claims for compensation.”

The suspension of the works at Nagymaros was intended to last for the
duration of these studies, which were to be completed by 31 July 1989.
Czechoslovakia immediately protested and a document defining the posi-
tion of Czechoslovakia was transmitted to the Ambassador of Hungary
in Prague on 15 May 1989. The Prime Ministers of the two countries met
on 24 May 1989, but their talks did not lead to any tangible result. On
2 June, the Hungarian Parliament authorized the Government to begin
negotiations with Czechoslovakia for the purpose of modifying the 1977
Treaty.

34. At a meeting held by the Plenipotentiaries on 8 and 9 June 1989,
Hungary gave Czechoslovakia a number of assurances concerning the
continuation of works in the Gabéikovo sector, and the signed Protocol
which records that meeting contains the following passage:

“The Hungarian Government Commissioner and the Hungarian
Plenipotentiary stated, that the Hungarian side will complete con-
struction of the Gabtikovo Project in the agreed time and in accord-
ance with the project plans. Directives have already been given to
continue works suspended in the area due to misunderstanding.”

These assurances were reiterated in a letter that the Commissioner of the
Government of Hungary addressed to the Czechoslovak Plenipotentiary
on 9 June 1989.

35. With regard to the suspension of work at Nagymaros, the Hungar-
ian Deputy Prime Minister, in a letter dated 24 June 1989 addressed to his
Czechoslovak counterpart, expressed himself in the following terms:

“The Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) has studied the envi-
ronmental, ecological and water quality as well as the seismological
impacts of abandoning or implementing the Nagymaros Barrage of
the Gabtikovo-Nagymaros Barrage System (GNBS).

Having studied the expected impacts of the construction in accord-
ance with the original plan, the Committee [ad hoc] of the Academy
[set up for this purpose] came to the conclusion that we do not have
adequate knowledge of the consequences of environmental risks.

In its opinion, the risk of constructing the Barrage System in
accordance with the original plan cannot be considered acceptable.
Of course, it cannot be stated either that the adverse impacts will



ensue for certain, therefore, according to their recommendation,
further thorough and time consuming studies are necessary.”

36. The Hungarian and Czechoslovak Prime Ministers met again on
20 July 1989 to no avail. Immediately after that meeting, the Hungarian
Government adopted a second resolution, under which the suspension of
work at Nagymaros was extended to 31 October 1989. However, this
resolution went further, as it also prescribed the suspension, until the
same date, of the “Preparatory works on the closure of the riverbed at
. .. Dunakiliti”; the purpose of this measure was to invite “international
scientific institutions [and] foreign scientific institutes and experts” to co-
operate with “the Hungarian and Czechoslovak institutes and experts”
with a view to an assessment of the ecological impact of the Project and
the “development of a technical and operational water quality guarantee
system and . . . its implementation”.

37. In the ensuing period, negotiations were conducted at various levels
between the two States, but proved fruitless. Finally, by a letter dated
4 October 1989, the Hungarian Prime Minister formally proposed to
Czechoslovakia that the Nagymaros sector of the Project be abandoned
and that an agreement be concluded with a view to reducing the ecologi-
cal risks associated with the Gabcikovo sector of the Project. He pro-
posed that that agreement should be concluded before 30 July 1990.

The two Heads of Government met on 26 October 1989, and were
unable to reach agreement. By a Note Verbale dated 30 October 1989,
Czechoslovakia, confirming the views it had expressed during those talks,
proposed to Hungary that they should negotiate an agreement on a sys-
tem of technical, operational and ecological guarantees relating to the
Gabeikovo-Nagymaros Project, “on the assumption that the Hungarian
party will immediately commence preparatory work on the refilling of the
Danube’s bed in the region of Dunakiliti”. It added that the technical
principles of the agreement could be initialled within two weeks and that
the agreement itself ought to be signed before the end of March 1990.
After the principles had been initialled, Hungary “[was to] start the actual
closure of the Danube bed”. Czechoslovakia further stated its willingness

to “conclu[de] . . . a separate agreement in which both parties would
oblige themselves to limitations or exclusion of peak hour operation
mode of the . . . System”. It also proposed “to return to deadlines indi-

cated in the Protocol of October 1983”, the Nagymaros construction
deadlines being thus extended by 15 months, so as to enable Hungary to
take advantage of the time thus gained to study the ecological issues and
formulate its own proposals in due time. Czechoslovakia concluded by
announcing that, should Hungary continue unilaterally to breach the
Treaty, Czechoslovakia would proceed with a provisional solution.

In the meantime, the Hungarian Government had on 27 October
adopted a further resolution, deciding to abandon the construction of the



Nagymaros dam and to leave in place the measures previously adopted
for suspending the works at Dunakiliti. Then, by Notes Verbales dated
3 and 30 November 1989, Hungary proposed to Czechoslovakia a draft
treaty incorporating its earlier proposals, relinquishing peak power opera-
tion of the Gabéikovo power plant and abandoning the construction of
