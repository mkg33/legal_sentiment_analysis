3. I find the foregoing arguments of Spain — which may not be wholly
consistent — unpersuasive for the following reasons.

4, If Spain means to maintain that a reservation is ineffective in so far
as it excludes measures or actions by the declarant State that are illegal
under international law, I cannot agree. As the Court’s Judgment
acknowledges, the very purpose, or one of the purposes, of States in mak-
ing reservations may be to debar the Court from passing upon actions of
the declarant State that may be or are legally questionable. If States by
their reservations could withhold jurisdiction only where their measures
and actions are incontestably legal, and not withhold jurisdiction where
their measures or actions are illegal or arguably illegal, much of the
reason for making reservations would disappear.

5. For the reason also stated in the Judgment of the Court, the conten-
tion of Spain that Canada’s reservation as Canada interprets it deprives
the Court of the authority to decide whether the Court has jurisdiction,
and hence violates Article 36, paragraph 6, of its Statute, is without
merit. The proceedings in the Court and the resultant Judgment more
than amply demonstrate that the Court has freely considered whether it
has jurisdiction. The Court has concluded, for the reasons meticulously
set out in the Judgment which have nothing to do with “self-judging” res-
ervations, that it has not.

6. Nor can I agree that reservation 2 (d), as interpreted by Canada to
apply (as its terms provide) to “disputes arising out of or concerning con-



servation and management measures taken by Canada with respect to
vessels fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area, as defined . . . and the
enforcement of such measures” can, as a counsel for Spain contended,
“apply to nothing”. Those measures, as explained in the Court’s Judg-
ment, are no less measures of conservation and management because
they are meant to apply, and by their terms and the regulations imple-
menting those terms, do apply, “in the NAFO Regulatory Area...” not
only to vessels that are stateless or flying flags of convenience but to other
foreign vessels.

7. But if it were to be accepted, arguendo, that the foregoing conten-
tions of Spain are correct, and that, by reason of Canada’s interpreting
its reservation to apply to any vessel fishing in the NAFO Regulatory
Area, the reservation lacks validity and is “a nullity” and “can apply
to nothing”, it does not follow that the Court has jurisdiction over
Spain’s cause of action. On the contrary, it follows that the Court is
altogether without jurisdiction since the nullity or ineffectiveness of
reservation 2 (d) entails the nullity or ineffectiveness of the Canadian
declaration as a whole.

9. In implementation of the foregoing reservation, Canada added to
its declaration of 10 September 1985 what appears in its declaration of
10 May 1994, namely and solely, reservation 2 (d). But it did not do this
by way of transmitting an amendment to the earlier declaration which
remained in force. Rather, in paragraph 1 of its declaration of 10 May
1994, Canada gave notice of termination of its acceptance of the Court’s
compulsory jurisdiction made on 10 September 1985. In paragraph 2, it
declared the acceptance by Canada of the Court’s jurisdiction over all
disputes other than those specified. in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and
(d). Since subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) are found in exactly the same
terms in the 1985 declaration, it is clear that the only reason of Canada
for terminating that declaration, and for making a new declaration, was
to add the provisions of subparagraph (d). Moreover, those provisions
do not comprise routine recitations, such as “without special agreement”



and “on condition of reciprocity”, which duplicate those of the Statute.
Subparagraph 2 (d) introduces an entirely new, specific and purpose-
ful reservation. It follows that the reservation contained in sub-
paragraph 2 (d) is not only an important but an essential provision of
Canada’s declaration, but for which, or without which, no new dec-
laration would have been made.

10. The Court has accepted “the close and necessary link that always
exists between a jurisdictional clause and reservations to it” (Aegean Sea
Continental Shelf, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1978, p. 33). Yet there may
be cases of jurisdictional adherence where that link may be severed. One
such has been suggested above, where a provision is redundant. Sever-
ability has been applied by other courts or committees in respect of cer-
tain human rights conventions. While venturing no opinion on the ten-
ability of severability in such circumstances, those are not the circum-
stances now before the Court. When, as in this case, the reservation has
been treated by the declarant State as an essential one but for which — or
without which — the declaration would not have been made, the Court is
not free to treat the reservation as invalid or ineffective, while treating the
remainder of the declaration to be in force. If reservation 2 (d) falls or
fails, so must the Canadian declaration of 10 May 1994 fall or fail. If the
Spanish argument is accepted on the results to be attached to Canada’s
interpretation of the reservation, it follows that there is no basis whatever
in this case for the jurisdiction of the Court.
