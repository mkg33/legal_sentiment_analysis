I agree with the conclusion of the judgment of the Court in
recognizing a right of passage for Portugal between Daman and the
enclaves and between the enclaves as sanctioned by local custom
in respect of private persons, civil officials and goods in general,
but I regret to be unable to concur in excluding from the scope or
content of this right the passage of Portuguese armed forces, armed
police and arms and ammunition. This right admittedly is not an
absolute right, since Portugal claims it only to the extent necessary
for the exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves and
subject to the control and regulation of India. As thus qualified, the
right of passage is, in my opinion, applicable to all the six categories.

1. Although the Government of British India never expressly
recognized passage as a matter of right for any category, in fact
such passage was always granted. As a general rule, after the coming
into force of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of Commerce and Extra-
dition of 26 December 1878, the British authorities required pre-
vious authorization for the passage of armed police, military units
and arms and ammunition in each case, but in fact the practice
of authorizing such passage was more uniform and constant than
in the case of private goods. Throughout the 130 years of British
rule in India, I am not aware of one single instance in the record
before the Court of a Portuguese request for passage of armed
police, military persons or units or arms and ammunition between
Daman and the enclaves ever having been refused. On the contrary,
in respect of ordinary goods there was enforced by the British a
prohibition of such transit for certain goods at different times, such
as rice, salt, liquor, spirits and ingredients for distilling liquor and
spirits, and there was indeed a total prohibition of passage for all
goods during the last war.

5. Earlier, two cases of passage of Portuguese soldiers across British
territory, though they do not bear directly on such transit between
Daman and the enclaves, are particularly significant in considering
the question of a local custom for such passage on the Indian penin-
sula. On 26 November 1901 the Portuguese Consul-General asked
the Governor-General of India for permission to send a detachment
of 20 soldiers from Daman by land through Bombay to Goa and
requested him to issue ‘‘urgently”’ the necessary orders for the
passage. This permission was given two days later in a reply of
28 November 1901 and confirmed on 30 November 1901, adding
a request that:

“...on future occasions the date of the proposed movement of such
detachments may be stated, and that sufficient notice may be given
to enable the orders of the Government to be obtained and instruc-
tions to be issued to the local authorities” (Counter-Memorial,
Annex C. No. 51).

Again, when there was a rebellion in 1912 against the Portuguese
Government in Goa, permission was asked on 5 August 1912 of
the Government of Bombay and it was granted by the Government
of India the following day, stating that they “have no objection
to their proposal to march one officer and sixty men across ten
kilometres of British territory”, “as a special case”. This detach-
ment did not travel as expected. In October of the same year,
however, the Portuguese Government at Goa again requested
permission to send sixty men in the charge of an officer for about
thirty miles across country to the Portuguese border. The reply
of the Government of India was again in the affirmative, stating:
“In the opinion of His Excellency we should not allow them trans-
port by train, but otherwise there is no objection.” The passage of
the detachment in question duly took place on the 15th and 16th
November of the same year (Counter-Memorial, Annex C. No. 52).

Even during the period when the Treaty of 1878 was in force,
though Article XVIII of it expressly provided for the requirement
of a formal request and permission for entry of the troops of one
High Contracting Party into the territory of the other, Portuguese
armed forces on a number of occasions, as indicated by the Govern-
ment of Bombay in its reply to the letter of 22 December 1890 of



the Governor-General of Portuguese India, travelled on duty across
British territory without having applied for and obtained previous
authorization, especially on the Daman-Silvassa (Nagar-Aveli) road.
What appears even more significant is the fact, as cited above, that
the British authorities expressed their preference for the continuance
of this practice of non-interference with such passages, obviously
in recognition of the necessity for them as well as out of considera-
tion for their own convenience on the reciprocal basis.


17. The Government of the Union of India respected and con-
tinued this practice up till 1954.

18. From the foregoing account of the British and Indian practice
in regulating the passage of troops, armed police, and arms and
ammunition from one Portuguese possession to another across inter-
vening British and later Indian territory, it appears clear that such
passage took place constantly and without difficulty, just as in the
case of private persons, civil officials and ordinary goods. In fact,
as pointed out above, the practice of authorizing passage of arms
and ammunition was even more uniform and constant than in the
case of ordinary goods.

19. The requirement of an application to, and a permission by, the
British authorities for the passage of troops and arms and ammu-
nition in each case only meant, in my view, a stricter measure of
control and regulation and did not necessarily signify that the
British considered themselves as warranted to refuse it at will and
did not regard Portugal as entitled to effect such passage. The degree
of control must naturally vary according to the nature of the
passage desired. The relatively simpler and less formal procedure
adopted for the passage of Portuguese armed police, under the
various agreements referred to above for “control of a fairly easily
exercisable type’ in the words of the British authorities cited
above, appears clearly to confirm this view.


20. The right of passage, as claimed and defined by Portugal, has
two concurrent features. Its content is to the extent necessary for
the exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves, and its
exercise is, at the same time, subject to the control and regulation
of India in so far as the passage takes place over the intervening
Indian territory. These two elements are inherent in the principle
of territorial sovereignty from which flows the right of passage on
the one hand and the right of control and regulation on the other.
It means that with the right on each side there also exists an obli-
gation—that of India to accord passage and that of Portugal to
respect the rules of procedure respecting the application for, and
grant of, passage. In other words, the rights and obligations of
both sides are concomitant and correlative. But they are reconcil-
able with each other in the light of how the problem was success-
fully dealt with in the past—in the long period before 1954; that
is, on the basis of the local custom which had crystallized from
the constant and uniform practice of both the British and Indian
authorities before that year.

It appears clear to me that the basic element in the policy of
control and regulation of passage by the intervening territorial
State in the past was consideration in good faith of its own national
interest. Where there was possible prejudice to such interest, pas-
sage was restricted or prohibited as was the case in regard to or-
dinary goods. But where there was no likelihood of such prejudice,
passage was readily granted even in regard to armed forces, armed
police, and arms and ammunition, as has been shown above. This
element of interest was the common denominator in the policy of
control and regulation applied to all categories of passage, whatever
variations there were in the procedure adopted for granting it.



21. If a local custom had evolved, as it undoubtedly had, for a
right of passage between Daman and the enclaves for private
persons, Portuguese civil officials and ordinary goods, a similar
custom, in my opinion based upon the consistent practice in the past,
had likewise come into being for a right of passage in regard to
Portuguese armed forces, armed police, and arms and ammunition.
Whatever distinction was observed by the British and Indian
Governments in granting passage between the enclaves and be-
tween them and coastal Daman for the different categories was a
matter of degree in applying a common policy of control and regu-
lation for all the categories of passage rather than a matter of studied
differentiation of the scope or content of the right of passage as
between one category and another.

implicit right of access to the assigned villages to collect the granted
annual revenue and this right necessarily included access of Portu-
guese troops, armed police, and arms and ammunition over the
intervening Maratha territory from Daman to the villages. In fact
Article 11 of the “Capitulations relating to the conditions in which
Portugal receives the Pragana of Nagar-Aveli”’, dated 1785 (An-
nex 8 to Memorial) reads in part:

“...and the Portuguese will quell any rebellion of the Colys which
might break out in the same Pragana’.

True, thisis of the character of an obligation imposed upon Portu-
gal. But in order to be able to carry out this obligation, she was
entitled, by necessary implication, to use all requisite and reason-
able means. In other words, she had the implicit right to bring
Portuguese troops, armed police, and arms and ammunition into
the villages for the purpose of quelling rebellion. This right of
access had, under the Marathas, as valid a basis as that for Portu-
guese civil officials and non-military goods for their use. Though
not often invoked by Portugal during the Maratha period, it was
more frequently exercised after the fall of the Maratha Empire as
an essential attribute of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves.
Like the right of passage for private persons, civil officials and
ordinary goods, it also developed into a customary right in fact,
as seen from the uniform and constant practice referred to above.

IT

23. Moreover, there are additional grounds for recognizing the
broader scope of the right of passage for Portugal.



Since Portugal bases this claim upon its title of sovereignty, it is
equally justifiable under the principle of territorial sovereignty.
For as to the validity of this title there is little ground for doubt.
Although no such title was acquired under the Marathas, and al-
though during the early years of British succession the attitude of
the British authorities on the subject was obscure, their tacit
recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves became
increasingly clear as time went on. The record of negotiations
between the Portuguese and British Commissioners for ‘the ex-
change of a narrow piece of land which should unite the Pragana of
Nagar-Aveliwith the other Praganasadjacent to the Fort of Daman”,
though the project did not materialize, lends further support to
this conclusion. It is also confirmed by the Treaty of 26 December
1878 concluded between Great Britain and Portugal which in its
preamble states: “being equally animated by the desire … to improve
and extend the relations of commerce between their respective
dominions...”. No exception or exclusion was stipulated as regards
the enclaves in the reference to the ‘respective dominions’; and
British recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves, as
well as over the other parts of the Portuguese dominions, must have
been equally implied. There was nothing in the record to indicate
any modification of the British attitude after the termination of
the treaty in 1801.


“The Government of India have suggested that the principle of
direct transfer should be accepted first and that this should be
followed by a de facto transfer of the administration... The legal
sovereignty of Portugal would continue until the steps then con-
sidered appropriate had been taken to give effect to the decisions
arrived at. The Government of India would be glad if the Govern-
ment of Portugal would accept these suggestions as a basis for the
proposed negotiations.” (Memorial, Annex 31.)

25. Since international law makes no distinction between one sover-
eignty and another, Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves is as
much entitled to exist as the sovereignty of the State by whose
territory it is encircled. And the passage of troops, armed police,
and arms and ammunition is as indispensable to the exercise of the
Portuguese sovereignty as, if not more so than, the passage of
private persons, civil officials and ordinary goods. Even though the
situation of an enclave is a special one, it is inconceivable in inter-
national law that one sovereignty exists only by the will or caprice
of another sovereignty. But on the other hand, while it is true that
this right of passage imposes a correlative obligation binding on
the State through whose territory it has to be effected, it is not an
absolute, unrestricted right; in the nature of things its exercise
must be subject to control and regulation by the sovereign of the
intervening territory.

The existence of two conflicting rights, however, is not an un-
common phenomenon in international law. In the complexities of
intercourse between nations such a situation is often unavoidable.
It is, however, not an intractable problem; its solution only calls
for mutual adaptation and adjustment. By reference to, and appli-
cation of, the general principles of law as stipulated in Article 38,
I, (c), of the Statute, as well as to customary international law,
similar situations have found solutions in the past.

26. In municipal law, as disclosed by a comparative study by
Professor Max Rheinstein, the right of access to enclaved property
is always sanctioned. Admittedly, there are important distinctions
between a right of passage of an international enclave and that of an
enclaved land owned by a private individual. But in whatever
mould municipal law may be cast, in whatever technical frame-
work it may be installed, in harmony with national tradition or
out of preference for a particular legal fiction, the underlying prin-


67 . RIGHT OF PASSAGE (SEP. OP. JUDGE WELLINGTON KOO)

ciple of recognition of such a right, in its essence, is the same. It
is the principle of justice founded on reason.

27. Indeed, in the last analysis, the fact that an enclaved land in
municipal law and an enclaved territory in the international domain
has always been able to enjoy passage through the surrounding
land of another owner or the surrounding territory of another State,
is based upon reason and the elementary principle of justice. For
such land or territory this transit is a necessity and it is reasonable
to provide for this necessity both in municipal law and in customary
international law. As the great Dutch jurisconsult, Cornelius van
Bynkershoek, has so well said: “In the law of nations, reason is
sovereign...” It is reason which dictates the recognition of a rule
of international customary law in application of the principle of
justice. Only by the existence of this rule of customary law can it
be explained that through the centuries, though many territorial
enclaves have existed and disappeared in the course of the develop-
ment of international relations, not a single case of disappearance
has been due to denial of passage and the consequent geographical
suffocation or strangulation. The reasonableness of according
passage through the surrounding territory accounts for the
constancy and uniformity of the usage which has ripened into a
customary right of passage for international enclaves, however
restricted or qualified it may be according to the circumstances of
each case.

28. On the surface, the right of passage of the sovereign of an enclave
and the right of the sovereign of the surrounding territory to
uphold his territorial sovereignty appear to be conflicting, but, as
I have already remarked, they are not incompatible or irreconcil-
able with each other. The fact that enclaves exist and thrive today
in many parts of the world shows that whatever difficulties may
have arisen between the enclaved and enclaving territories from
time to time have always been satisfactorily arranged in good faith
and with goodwill on both sides. The relations between the two
territorial situations are not unlike the relations between the ocean
and the rivers which empty their waters into it. Sometimes the
necessity to exercise the sovereignty over the enclave is more
pressing than the right of the enclaving State to protect its territorial
sovereignty intact and sometimes the reverse istrue; just as during
the spring thaw a river rising high with water discharges it deep
into the ocean and, during the flow of the tide, the ocean pushes its
tide water well up the river, without denying the existence of either.
They co-exist and perform their respective functions. There is no
intrinsic conflict between them and there is none either between the
right of passage of an enclave of one State and the territorial sover-
eignty of the enclosing State. For customary international law is
no less resourceful than the law of geophysics.

29. For the reasons stated above, I hold that Portugal's right of
passage between the enclaves and between them and coastal Daman
embraces all the six categories, to the extent necessary for the
exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves and subject to
control and regulation by India.
