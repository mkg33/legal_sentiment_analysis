                             2. Whether Qatar’s claims are inadmissible on grounds of

                                                      YEAR 2020
       14 July                                        14 July 2020

                      Court’s appellate function.
                      Article II, Section 2, encompasses appeal against decisions on preliminary
                    objections — Court has jurisdiction to entertain appeal — Court’s role is to deter‑
                    mine whether impugned decision is correct.

                      Grounds of appeal — No requirement to follow order of grounds of appeal used
                    by Appellants.

                       Second ground of appeal — Rejection by the Council of first preliminary objec‑
                    tion.
                       Jurisdiction — Disagreement between the Parties before the Council concerns
                    interpretation and application of IASTA and falls within the scope of Article II,






10 CIJ1192_Ord.indb 6                                                                                     10/08/21 10:34


                    Section 2 — Mere fact that disagreement arose in a broader context does not
                    deprive the Council of jurisdiction under Article II, Section 2 — Council did
                    not err when it rejected first preliminary objection in so far as it concerned jurisdic‑
                    tion.
                       Admissibility — Difficulty of applying concept of judicial propriety to the
                    Council — Integrity of the Council’s dispute settlement function under Article II,
                    Section 2, not affected by consideration of issues outside civil aviation — Council
                    did not err when it rejected first preliminary objection in so far as it concerned
                    admissibility.
                       Second ground of appeal cannot be upheld.

                        Third ground of appeal — Rejection by the Council of second preliminary objec‑
                    tion.
                        Jurisdiction — Article II, Section 2, imposes precondition of negotiation —
                    Genuine attempt to negotiate must be made prior to filing of application before the
                    Council — Precondition satisfied if negotiations reach point of futility or dead‑
                    lock — Genuine attempt to negotiate can be made outside of bilateral diplo‑
                    macy — Qatar made a genuine attempt to negotiate both within and outside ICAO
                    to settle disagreement — No reasonable probability of negotiated settlement as of
                    filing of Qatar’s application to the Council — Council did not err when it rejected
                    second preliminary objection in so far as it concerned jurisdiction.


                       Admissibility — Article 2, subparagraph (g), of the ICAO Rules for the Settle‑
                    ment of Differences requires application and memorial filed pursuant to Article 84
                    (incorporated by reference in Article II, Section 2) to include statement that nego‑
                    tiations took place but were not successful — Statement in Qatar’s application and
                    memorial satisfies requirement — Council did not err when it rejected second pre‑
                    liminary objection in so far as it concerned admissibility.

                        Third ground of appeal cannot be upheld.

                                                               *
                       First ground of appeal — Due process in procedure before the Council.
                       Issues presented by the preliminary objections are objective questions of law —
                    Council’s procedures did not prejudice in any fundamental way the requirements of
                    a just procedure.
                       First ground of appeal cannot be upheld.
