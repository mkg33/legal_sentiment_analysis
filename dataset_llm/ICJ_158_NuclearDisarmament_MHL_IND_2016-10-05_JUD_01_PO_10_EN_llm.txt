   1. I have voted against the operative paragraph of the Judgment
because I am unable to agree with the decision of the Court upholding the
ﬁrst preliminary objection of India, as well as the underlying reasoning.
In my view, the majority of the Court has unjustiﬁably departed from the
ﬂexible and discretionary approach that it has hitherto consistently
adopted in determining the existence of a dispute, choosing instead, to
introduce a new rigorous and formalistic test of “awareness” that raises
the evidentiary threshold and that is bound to present the Court with dif-
ﬁculties in future. Furthermore, given the importance of the subject-
matter of this case not only to the Parties involved but to the
international community as a whole, I ﬁnd it regrettable that the Court
has opted to adopt an inﬂexible approach that has resulted in summarily
disposing of this case at this early stage. I explain my views in more detail
in this separate opinion.

  2. If there is one lesson that the international community learnt from
the human catastrophes that were the First and Second World Wars, it
was the need for a concerted, global eﬀort
      “[t]o save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which
      twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to
      reaﬃrm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth


451        nuclear arms and disarmament (sep. op. sebutinde)

      of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of
      nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which jus-
      tice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other
      sources of international law can be maintained . . .” 1.

 3. It is also important to recollect the purpose for which the United
Nations was created, namely,
      “to maintain international peace and security, and to that end : to take
      eﬀective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats
      to peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other
      breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in
      conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjust-
      ment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might
      lead to a breach of the peace” 2.
Under the Charter, although the primary responsibility for the mainte-
nance of international peace and security lies with the Security Council 3,
and to a lesser extent, the General Assembly 4, the International Court of
Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations 5 does con-
tribute to the maintenance of international peace and security through its
judicial settlement of such inter-State disputes as are referred to it for
adjudication 6 and through the exercise of its advisory role in accordance
with the Charter and the Statute of the Court 7. Today there is no greater
threat to international peace and security, or indeed to humanity, than
the threat or prospect of a nuclear war.

  4. It may also be useful to brieﬂy recall the historical background to
the present case. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weap-
ons (NPT) which entered into force in 1970 8 and whose objectives are, to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology ; to pro-
mote co-operation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to further the
goal of achieving nuclear disarmament, currently has 191 States parties

including the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) 9. India has neither
signed nor ratiﬁed the NPT (Judgment, para. 17). However, contrary to
the NPT objectives, State practice demonstrates that for the past nearly
70 years, some States have continued to manufacture, acquire, upgrade,
test and/or deploy nuclear weapons and that a threat of possible use is
inherent in such deployment. Furthermore, State practice demonstrates
that far from proscribing the threat or use of nuclear weapons in all cir-
cumstances, the international community has, by treaty and through the
United Nations Security Council, recognized in eﬀect that in certain
circumstances the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons may even be
justiﬁed.
   5. In December 1994 the United Nations General Assembly sought an
advisory opinion from the Court regarding the legality of the threat or
use of nuclear weapons 10. The question posed by the General Assembly
was quite simply “Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circum-
stance permitted under international law?” In response, the Court consid-
ered that it was being asked “to determine the legality or illegality of the
threat or use of nuclear weapons” 11. After taking into account the body
of international law (including Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of
the United Nations Charter) as well as the views of a vast number of
States that ﬁled their written submissions before the Court, the Court
opined that :
— there is no speciﬁc authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weap-
  ons in either customary or conventional international law 12;

— there is no comprehensive and universal prohibition of the threat or
  use of nuclear weapons as such, in either customary or conventional
  international law 13;
— a threat or use of nuclear weapons that was contrary to Article 2,
  paragraph 4, or that failed to meet all the requirements of Article 51
  of the United Nations Charter ; or that is incompatible with the prin-
  ciples and rules of international humanitarian law applicable in armed
  conﬂict or that is incompatible with treaties speciﬁcally dealing with
  nuclear weapons, is illegal 14.

  6. However, the Court did make one exception to its ﬁndings (albeit in
an evenly divided manner 15) when it opined that :

       “in view of the current state of international law, and of the elements
       of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude deﬁnitively whether
       the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in
       an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of
       a State would be at stake” 16.
  7. Finally, although this does not appear to have been in direct
answer to the question posed by the General Assembly, the Court went
an extra mile in what, in my view, is the real contribution of the Court to
world peace and security as far as the question of nuclear weapons is
concerned. It stated in paragraphs 98 to 100 of the Advisory Opinion, as
follows :
          “Given the eminently diﬃcult issues that arise in applying the
       law on the use of force and above all the law applicable in armed
       conﬂict to nuclear weapons, the Court considers that it now needs to
       examine one further aspect of the question before it, seen in a broader
       context.
          In the long run, international law, and with it the stability of the
       international order which it is intended to govern, are bound to suﬀer
       from the continuing diﬀerence of views with regard to the legal status
       of weapons as deadly as nuclear weapons. It is consequently impor-
       tant to put an end to this state of aﬀairs : the long-promised complete
       nuclear disarmament appears to be the most appropriate means of
       achieving that result.
          In these circumstances, the Court appreciates the full importance
       of the recognition by Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
       of Nuclear Weapons of an obligation to negotiate in good faith a
       nuclear disarmament . . . The legal import of that obligation goes
       beyond that of a mere obligation of conduct ; the obligation involved
       here is an obligation to achieve a precise result — nuclear disarma-
       ment in all its aspects — by adopting a particular course of conduct,
       namely, the pursuit of negotiations on the matter in good faith.
          This twofold obligation to pursue and to conclude negotiations
       formally concerns the 182 States parties to the [NPT], or, in other
       words, the vast majority of the international community . . . Indeed,
       any realistic search for general and complete disarmament, especially
       nuclear disarmament, necessitates the co-operation of all States.”
       (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion,

   8. The Court then unanimously opined in the operative clause that,
“There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a con-
clusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects
under strict and eﬀective international control.” 17 The Advisory Opinion
of the Court, although not legally binding, was well received by the vast
majority of NPT States parties, although it was less welcome by those
nuclear-weapon States that were of the view that the Court had
over-stepped its judicial function by rendering this Opinion. In Decem-
ber 1996 the General Assembly passed a resolution endorsing the conclu-
sion of the Court relating to the existence of “an obligation to pursue in
good faith and to bring to a conclusion, negotiations leading to disarma-
ment in all its aspects under strict and eﬀective international control” and
calling upon all States to immediately commence multilateral negotia-
tions leading to a nuclear weapons convention prohibiting “the develop-
ment, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, threat or use of
nuclear weapons” and providing for their elimination 18.

       The Threshold for Determining the Existence of a Dispute
                and the New Criterion of “Awareness”

   10. The Marshall Islands bases the jurisdiction of the Court on its
optional clause declaration pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 2, of the
Statute of the Court dated 15 March 2013 and deposited on 24 April
2013, recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court ; and that of
India dated 15 September 1974 and deposited on 18 September 1974,
which declarations the Marshall Islands claims are “without pertinent
reservation” 19. India, which is not party to the NPT (Judgment, para. 17),
raised a number of preliminary objections against the Court’s jurisdic-
tion, including the absence of a legal dispute between the Applicant and
Respondent as at 24 April 2014, the date of ﬁling of the Application. The
Marshall Islands disagrees and maintains that a dispute did exist at the
time it ﬁled its Application, the subject-matter of which is “India’s com-
pliance or non-compliance with its obligation under customary interna-
tional law to pursue in good faith, and bring to a conclusion, negotiations
leading to nuclear disarmament” 20. In its Judgment, the Court agrees
with India in this regard and upholds its objection to jurisdiction (ibid.,
para. 56). I respectfully disagree with the majority decision as well as
the underlying reasoning, and set out my reasons in this separate opinion.
In my view, the evidence on record when properly tested against the
criteria well-established in the Court’s jurisprudence, shows that a dispute
did exist between the Parties before the ﬁling of the Application.
I particularly disagree with the new criterion of “awareness” that the
majority introduces, as well as the formalistic and inﬂexible approach
taken in the determination of whether or not a dispute exists (ibid.,
paras. 38-49).


   11. India contends that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the
claim of Marshall Islands on the grounds that :
(a) prior to or at the time the Marshall Islands ﬁled its Application on
    24 April 2014, there was no legal dispute in existence between the
    Parties that could trigger the Court’s jurisdiction under its
    Statute 21;
(b) that the Marshall Islands had never brought its claim to the attention
    of India, nor attempted to hold diplomatic negotiations with India
    before ﬁling the case with the Court. Consequently, there could be no
    conﬂict of legal positions between the two Parties, and as such no
    legal dispute between them 22;

(c) that the claim of the Marshall Islands is artiﬁcial 23 in as far as the
    Applicant cites an “undeﬁned and unstated principle” of customary
    international law 24; and
(d) that the claim of the Marshall Islands constitutes an abuse of process
    in as far as the Marshall Islands is attempting to impose upon India
    the obligations established in the NPT, a treaty that it has systemat-
    ically rejected 25.
   12. For its part, the Marshall Islands maintains that a dispute did exist
between the Parties at the time the Application was ﬁled 26, the subject-
matter of which is “India’s non-compliance with its obligation under cus-
tomary international law to pursue in good faith and to bring to a
conclusion, negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects
under strict and eﬀective international control” 27. It argues further that it
has repeatedly called upon nuclear-weapon States, including India, to
comply with their international obligations and to negotiate nuclear dis-
armament 28. In particular the Marshall Islands refers to two of its state-
ments made publicly in the presence of India before the Application was
ﬁled. First, on 26 September 2013, at the UN High-Level Meeting on
Nuclear Disarmament, the Minister of Foreign Aﬀairs of the Marshall
Islands called upon: “all nuclear weapon States to intensify efforts to
address their responsibilities in moving towards an effective and secure
disarmament” 29. Secondly, on 13 February 2014, during the Second Con-
ference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons at Nayarit,
Mexico, the RMI representative made similar remarks 30.


   13. The Marshall Islands submits that these and other public
statements “illustrate with perfect clarity the content of the claim . . .” 31
and that these statements were “unequivocally directed against all States
possessing nuclear arsenals, including India” (emphasis added) 32. The fact
that India participated in those conferences was, according to the

Marshall Islands, suﬃcient to consider it notiﬁed of the claim of the
Marshall Islands, in particular, because the RMI statements were very
clear on the subject-matter of the dispute, namely, the failure of
nuclear-weapon States to seriously engage in multilateral negotiation
leading to nuclear disarmament arising under the NPT and/or customary
international law. The legal basis of the claim was also clearly identi-
ﬁed 33. Finally, the Marshall Islands considers that its claims have been
positively opposed by India in that the latter, while rhetorically claiming
to be committed to achieving a nuclear-free world, has continued to
“engage in a course of conduct consisting of the quantitative build-up
and qualitative improvement of its nuclear arsenal, which is contrary to
the objective of nuclear disarmament” 34. Furthermore, the Marshall
Islands submits that India positively opposed the Applicant’s claims in its
Letter of 6 June 2014 and in its Counter-Memorial, where it explicitly
disputed the validity of those claims 35, considering that such denial con-
stitutes a legal dispute in itself 36. On the issue of negotiations, the Mar-
shall Islands submits that it was under no obligation to pursue diplomatic
negotiations with India prior to submitting the dispute before the Court 37.
Finally, the Marshall Islands addresses the applicability of the ILC Arti-
cles on State Responsibility to the present dispute and points out that,
according to the ILC commentary, the said Articles do not concern the
jurisdiction of international courts 38. In its Judgment, the Court upholds
India’s preliminary objection to jurisdiction on the ground that there was
no dispute between the Parties prior to the ﬁling of the RMI Application.
I respectfully disagree with that decision as well as the underlying reason-
ing and set out my reasons in this separate opinion. In my view, the evi-
dence on record when properly tested against the criteria well-established
in the Court’s jurisprudence shows that a dispute did exist, albeit in a
nascent form, between the Parties before the ﬁling of the Application and
that this dispute crystallized during the proceedings. I particularly dis-
agree with the new criterion of “awareness” that the majority introduces,
as well as the formalistic and inﬂexible approach taken in the determina-
tion of whether or not a dispute exists.

in determining whether the Parties had “clearly opposite views” 39. The
Court’s jurisprudence clearly demonstrates the Court’s consistent prefer-
ence for a ﬂexible approach that steers clear of formality or proce-
dural rigour, right from the days of the Permanent Court of International
Justice 40, and until more recently in Croatia v. Serbia 41.

achieve its own interests, which conduct is then protested by the other, a
positive opposition of views or interests is demonstrated. The perspective
that takes into account the conduct of the contesting parties in determin-
ing the existence or otherwise of a dispute, and with which I agree, was
aptly expressed by Judge Gaetano Morelli in his dissenting opinion in the
South West Africa cases when he stated as follows :

      as existing.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
         In my opinion, a dispute consists, not of a conﬂict of interests as
      such, but rather in a contrast between the respective attitudes of the
      parties in relation to a certain conﬂict of interests. The opposing atti-
      tudes of the parties, in relation to a given conﬂict of interests, may
      respectively consist of the manifestations of the will by which each of
      the parties requires that its own interest be realized. It is the case of
      a dispute resulting, on one side, from a claim by one of the parties
      and, on the other side, of the contesting of that claim by the other
      party. But it may also be that one of the opposing attitudes of the
      parties consists, not of a manifestation of the will, but rather of a
      course of conduct by means of which the party pursuing that course
      directly achieves its own interest. This is the case of a claim which is
      followed not by the contesting of the claim but by the adoption of a

has raised issue within its Application and Memorial is “India’s continu-
ing breach of its obligations under customary international law to pursue
in good faith, and bring to a conclusion, negotiations leading to nuclear
disarmament” 51. Furthermore, the Marshall Islands has in its Applica-
tion cited India’s nuclear weapons program which India is reportedly
expanding 52. The Marshall Islands refers to this program as “a quantita-
tive build-up and qualitative improvement” 53 of India’s nuclear arsenal
and submits that it is inconsistent with India’s erga omnes obligations
under customary international law to pursue negotiations towards nuclear


India’s commitment to meaningful negotiations towards nuclear disarma-
ment. The Marshall Islands maintains that notwithstanding its voting
patterns, India’s course of conduct consisting, on the one hand, of its
participation in the nuclear arms race and, on the other hand, its failure
to pursue multilateral negotiations towards nuclear disarmament, is
inconsistent with its obligations under customary international law. With-

   22. In this regard, I have taken into account relevant statements of
high-ranking oﬃcials of each of the Parties. The Marshall Islands speciﬁ-
cally mentions the statements it made when it joined the NPT 54, and
those made during the 2010 NPT Review Conference, the 2013 United
Nations High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament 55, and the
2014 Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons 56.
The Marshall Islands argues that those statements were suﬃcient to make
all nuclear-weapon States, including India, aware of the Marshall Islands
position on the matter 57.
   23. First, the views of the Marshall Islands on nuclear disarmament

      overdue. Indeed we believe that States possessing nuclear arsenals are
      failing to fulﬁl their legal obligations in this regard. Immediate com-
      mencement and conclusion of such negotiations is required by legal
      obligation of nuclear disarmament resting upon each and every State
      under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty and customary inter-
      national law.” 59 (Emphasis added.)

  25. In my view, those statements also represent the RMI’s claim that
nuclear-weapon States, including India, are obliged under the NPT and/

for mention by the RMI, it was implicitly included in the category of
nuclear-weapon States that were “failing to fulﬁl their international obli-
gations to carry out multilateral negotiations on achieving sustainable
nuclear disarmament”.

   26. In my view, the “Nayarit Declaration” quoted above did mention
with suﬃcient clarity both the obligation on nuclear-weapon States to
negotiate nuclear disarmament as well as the legal basis upon which the
Marshall Islands based that obligation, namely, “Article VI of the

the present case, where it is well known throughout the international
community, that amongst the over 191 member States to the NPT, only

    60 Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, India, Pakistan and North Korea have all


464         nuclear arms and disarmament (sep. op. sebutinde)

nine possess nuclear weapons. To insist that the Marshall Islands should
in its statements have identiﬁed each of these States by name and men-
tioned the conduct of each one that it objects to, is to apply form over
substance. Similarly, the fact that the Nayarit Declaration was made at a
conference the subject of which was the “broader question of the human-
itarian impact of nuclear weapons” does not detract from the clarity of

the purposes of demonstrating the existence of opposing views, the Mar-
shall Islands has made it clear that it has no issues with India’s rhetoric in
this regard. Its opposition is with regard to India’s failure to pursue in
good faith those obligations. Again, without prejudging the issue of
whether or not India’s nuclear policy is in breach of its international obli-
gations, the above facts clearly demonstrate that there is a course of con-
duct by one of the Parties (India) to achieve its own interests, which the
other Party (Marshall Islands) meets by protest, thus crystalizing the dis-
pute between the Parties.


       “it is well-known that India is committed to the goal of a nuclear-
       weapon-free world through global, veriﬁable and non-discriminatory
       nuclear disarmament. India believes that this goal can be achieved
       through a step-by-step process underwritten by a universal commit-
       ment and an agreed global and non-discriminatory multilateral
       framework. It is also well-known that pending global nuclear disar-
       mament, India is committed for reasons of national security and self-
       defence to building and maintaining a credible minimum nuclear


   29. Thus while both Parties are at least in nominal agreement regard-
ing the desirability of a nuclear-free world, they have diﬀerent notions
regarding how and when to achieve that goal. Both Parties hold opposing
views on certain key issues. First, they disagree on the existence of an
obligation under customary international law to negotiate nuclear disar-
mament and on whether India has breached that obligation 63. Secondly
they hold opposing views regarding the legality of India’s maintenance
and improvement of a nuclear arsenal for “defense purposes” and whether
it is necessarily incompatible with the alleged international obligation to

as “an abuse of process” 66. Without prejudging any of the above ques-
tions (all of which are issues to be addressed at the merits stage), this
divergence of opinions conﬁrms the existence of a dispute for the pur-
poses of determining the Court’s jurisdiction.

           The New Criterion of “Awareness” in Determining
                  the Existence of a Dispute Is Alien
                    to the Court’s Jurisprudence

   30. Hitherto, the Court has not made it a legal prerequisite for an
applicant to prove that before the application was ﬁled, the respondent
State “was aware or could not have been unaware that its views were
positively opposed by the applicant”, before making a determination that

stated in the South West Africa cases that :
        “A mere assertion is not suﬃcient to prove the existence of a dispute
      any more than a mere denial of the existence of the dispute proves its
      non-existence. Nor is it adequate to show that the interests of the two
      parties to such a case are in conﬂict. It must be shown that the claim
      of one party is positively opposed by the other.” 69

Also in Nicaragua v. Colombia the Court stated that, “although a formal
diplomatic protest may be an important step to bring a claim of one party
to the attention of the other, such a formal protest is not a necessary con-

applicant to make some form of formal notiﬁcation or diplomatic pro-
test. The test also introduces subjectivity into an equation previously
reserved “for the Court’s objective determination”.

  32. It is also pertinent to note that paragraph 73 of Nicaragua v.
Colombia cited by the majority at paragraph 38 of the Judgment as the
basis for the new “awareness” test, merely sets out the factual assessment
conducted by the Court to determine whether a dispute existed in that
case 71, and not the legal test applicable. In paragraph 72 of Nicaragua v.
Colombia, immediately preceding, the Court had just observed that,

factual ﬁnding into a formalistic legal requirement of prior notiﬁcation.
In my view, it would be inappropriate to turn what was clearly a factual
observation into a rigid legal test that was rejected by the Court in that
case.
   33. Similarly, Georgia v. Russian Federation 73, also cited in the Judg-
ment at paragraph 38 in support of the majority view, is inapplicable and
should be distinguished. That case involved the interpretation and appli-
cation of a speciﬁc treaty (the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination) to which both Georgia and Russia were

   71 The exact quotation of paragraph 73 is “Colombia was aware that its enactment

of Decree 1946 and its conduct in the maritime areas declared by the 2012 Judgment to
belong to Nicaragua were positively opposed by Nicaragua”. The applicable legal frame-
work regarding the existence of the dispute is quoted at: Alleged Violations of Sovereign
Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), pp. 26-27, paras. 49-52.

logical that the Respondent formally be made “aware” of the Applicant’s
claim before negotiations could take place. That case is in stark contrast
to the present case where no such compromissory clause exists requiring

on which the Application was ﬁled, there existed a dispute between the
Parties concerning the alleged violation, by India, of an obligation under
customary international law to pursue in good faith and bring to a con-
clusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects
under strict and eﬀective international control.
