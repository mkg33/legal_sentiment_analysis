                       First operative paragraph of the 1962 Judgment clear in meaning — Temple

                         The Court,
                         composed as above,
                         after deliberation,
                         delivers the following Judgment :
                         1. On 28 April 2011, the Kingdom of Cambodia (hereinafter “Cambodia”)
                     filed in the Registry of the Court an Application instituting proceedings in
                     which, referring to Article 60 of the Statute of the Court and Article 98 of the
                     Rules of Court, Cambodia requests the Court to interpret the Judgment which
                     it delivered on 15 June 1962 in the case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear
                     (Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 6 (hereinafter





8 Ord 1050.indb 12                                                                                           25/06/14 13:11

                     286 	            request for interpretation (judgment)

                     the “1962 Judgment”). Cambodia on the same day, referring to Article 41 of the
                     Statute and Article 73 of the Rules of Court, also filed a Request for the indica-
                     tion of provisional measures in order to “cause [the] incursions [by Thailand]
                     onto its territory to cease”.
                        2. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Registrar
                     communicated the Application forthwith to the Government of the Kingdom of
                     Thailand (hereinafter “Thailand”) ; and, pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Arti-
                     cle, all other States entitled to appear before the Court were notified of the
                     Application. Pursuant to Article 73, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the
                     Registrar transmitted a certified copy of the Request for the indication of provi-
                     sional measures to Thailand.
                        3. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
                     either of the Parties, each Party exercised its right, conferred by Article 31, para-
                     graph 3, of the Statute, to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the case ; Cambodia
                     chose Mr. Gilbert Guillaume, and Thailand Mr. Jean‑Pierre Cot.

                        4. By an Order of 18 July 2011, the Court, after rejecting Thailand’s request
                     for the case to be removed from the General List of the Court, indicated the
                     following provisional measures :
                         “(1) Both Parties shall immediately withdraw their military personnel cur-
                              rently present in the provisional demilitarized zone, as defined in par-
                              agraph 62 of the present Order, and refrain from any military presence
                              within that zone and from any armed activity directed at that zone ;

                          (2) Thailand shall not obstruct Cambodia’s free access to the Temple of
                              Preah Vihear or Cambodia’s provision of fresh supplies to its non‑­
                              military personnel in the Temple ;
                          (3) Both Parties shall continue the co‑operation which they have entered into
                              within ASEAN and, in particular, allow the observers appointed by that
                              organization to have access to the provisional demilitarized zone ;
                          (4) Both Parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or
                              extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve.”

                              operative part.)
                     It further decided that “each Party shall inform the Court as to its compliance
                     with the above provisional measures” and that, “until the Court has rendered its
                     judgment on the request for interpretation, it shall remain seised of the matters
                     which form the subject of this Order” (ibid., points C and D of the operative

                        8. In accordance with Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the
                     Court decided, after ascertaining the views of the Parties, that copies of the
                     pleadings and documents annexed would be made accessible to the public on the
                     opening of the oral proceedings.
                        9. Public hearings were held from 15 to 19 April 2013, at which the Court
                     heard the oral arguments and replies of :
                     For Cambodia : H.E. Mr. Hor Namhong,

                     For Thailand : H.E. Mr. Virachai Plasai,
                                     Mr. Donald McRae,

                        10. At the hearings, a Member of the Court put a question to the Parties, to
                     which replies were given orally and in writing, in accordance with Article 61,
                     paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to Article 72 of the Rules of
                     Court, each Party presented written observations on the written replies received
                     from the other.

                       11. In the Application, Cambodia presented the following claims :
                              “Given that ‘the Temple of Preah Vihear is situated in territory under the
                          sovereignty of Cambodia’ (first paragraph of the operative clause [of the
                          1962 Judgment]), which is the legal consequence of the fact that the Temple
                          is situated on the Cambodian side of the frontier, as that frontier was
                          ­recognized by the Court in its Judgment, and on the basis of the facts
                           and arguments set forth above, Cambodia respectfully asks the Court to
                           adjudge and declare that :
                              The obligation incumbent upon Thailand to ‘withdraw any military or
                           police forces, or other guards or keepers, stationed by her at the Temple,
                           or in its vicinity on Cambodian territory’ (second paragraph of the operative
                           clause [of the 1962 Judgment]) is a particular consequence of the general
                           and continuing obligation to respect the integrity of the territory of Cam-
                          bodia, that territory having been delimited in the area of the Temple and
                          its vicinity by the line on the Annex I map, on which the Judgment of the
                          Court is based.” (P. 36, para. 45.)
                       12. In the written proceedings, the Parties made the following submissions :

                     On behalf of the Government of Cambodia,
                     in the further explanations presented on 8 March 2012 :
                             “On the basis of the facts and arguments set out in its Application for
                          interpretation and in this Response, Cambodia respectfully asks the Court
                          to adjudge and declare :
