legal foundation in Articles I, X, XV, paragraph 3, of the Treaty
of Commerce and Navigation of November 10th, 1886, and
likewise in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of the Treaty of July 16th, 1926,
which are in identical or equivalent terms to the first two provi-
sions referred to above ;

2. that the British Government has, through its Counsel, Sir Eric
Beckett, expressed its willingness that the Court should under-
take the function of arbitration in the event of its holding that
it has jurisdiction to decide the question whether the Greek
claim should be submitted to arbitration, as provided for by
the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of 1886, and in the event
of the Court’s giving an affirmative decision on this question.

This having been done, for the reasons indicated in the Hellenic
Observations and enlarged upon by Counsel ;

to hold that it has jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the
Hellenic claim, and accordingly to fix time-limits for the filing by
the Parties of the Reply and the Rejoinder on the merits ;

in the alternative, if the Court should hold that it cannot reach
a decision as to its jurisdiction without going into the merits, by
application of Article 62 of its Rules, to join the Objection to the
merits.”



The Treaty provisions herein before mentioned are as follows :

Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of November roth, 1886

“Article I

There shall be between the dominions and possessions of the
two High Contracting Parties reciprocal freedom of commerce
and navigation. The subjects of each of the two Parties shall have
liberty freely to come, with their ships and cargoes, to all places,
ports and rivers in the dominions and possessions of the other
to which native subjects generally are or may be permitted to
come, and shall enjoy respectively the same rights, privileges,
liberties, favours, immunities and exemptions in matters of com-
merce and navigation which are or may be enjoyed by native
subjects without having to pay any tax or impost greater than
those paid by the same, and they shall be subject to the laws and
regulations in force.

Article X

The Contracting Parties agree that, in all matters relating to
commerce and navigation, any privilege, favour, or immunity
whatever which either Contracting Party has actually granted
or may hereafter grant to the subjects or citizens of any other
State shall be extended immediately and unconditionally to the
subjects or citizens of the other Contracting Party ; it being their
intention that the trade and navigation of each country shall be
placed, in all respects, by the other on the footing of the most-
favoured nation.

Article XV

The dwellings, manufactories, warehouses and shops of the
subjects of each of the Contracting Parties in the dominions and
possessions of the other, and all premises appertaining thereto
destined for purposes of residence or commerce shall be respected.

It shall not be allowable to proceed to make a search of, or
a domiciliary visit to, such dwellings and premises, or to examine
and inspect books, papers, or accounts, except under the con-
ditions and with the form prescribed by the laws for subjects of
the country.

The subjects of each of the two Contracting Parties in the
dominions and possessions of the other shall have free access to
the Courts of Justice for the prosecution and defence of their
rights, without other conditions, restrictions, or taxes beyond
those imposed on native subjects, and shall, like them, be at liberty
to employ, in all causes, their advocates, attorneys or agents, from
among the persons admitted to the exercise of those professions
according to the laws of the country.”

Protocol of November 10th, 1886


“At the moment of proceeding this day to the signature of
the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain



and Greece, the Plenipotentiaries of the two High Contracting
Parties have declared as follows :

Any controversies which may arise respecting the interpretation
or the execution of the present Treaty, or the consequences of
any violation thereof, shall be submitted, when the means of
settling them directly by amicable agreement are exhausted, to
the decision of Commissions of Arbitration, and the result of such
arbitration shall be binding upon both Governments.

The members of such Commissions shall be selected by the two
Governments by common consent, failing which each of the Parties
shall nominate an Arbitrator, or an equal number of Arbitrators,
and the Arbitrators thus appointed shall select an Umpire.

The procedure of the Arbitration shall in each case be determined
by the Contracting Parties, failing which the Commission of Arbi-
tration shall be itself entitled to determine it beforehand.

The undersigned Plenipotentiaries have agreed that this Protocol
shall be submitted to the two High Contracting Parties at the
same time as the Treaty, and that when the Treaty is ratified,
the agreements contained in the Protocol shall also equally be
considered as approved, without the necessity of a further formal
ratification.”

Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of July 16th, 1926


“Article 1

There shall be between the territories of the two Contracting
Parties reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation.

The subjects or citizens of each of the two Contracting Parties
shall have liberty freely to come, with their ships and cargoes,
to all places and ports in the territories of the other to which
subjects or citizens of that Contracting Party are, or may be,
permitted to come, and shall enjoy the same rights, privileges,
liberties, favours, immunities and exemptions in matters of
commerce and navigation as are, or may be, enjoyed by subjects
or citizens of that Contracting Party.

Article 3

The subjects or citizens of each of the two Contracting Parties
in the territories of the other shall enjoy, in respect of their persons,
their property, rights and interest, and in respect of their com-
merce, industry, profession, occupation, or any other matter, in
every way the same treatment and legal protection as the subjects
or citizens of that Party or of the most-favoured foreign country,
in as far as taxes, rates, customs, imposts, fees which are sub-
stantially taxes, and other similar charges are concerned.

Article 4

The two Contracting Parties agree that in all matters relating
to commerce, navigation and industry and the exercise of profes-
sions or occupations, any privileges, favour or immunity which
either of the two Contracting Parties has actually granted, or may


hereafter grant, to the ships and subjects or citizens of any other
foreign country shall be extended, simultaneously and uncondition-
ally, without request and without compensation, to the ships and
subjects or citizens of the other, it being their intention that the
commerce, navigation and industry of each of the two Contracting
Parties shall be placed in all respects on the footing of the most-
favoured nation.

Article 29

The two Contracting Parties agree in principle that any dispute
that may arise between them as to the proper interpretation or
application of any of the provisions of the present Treaty shall,
at the request of either Party, be referred to arbitration.

The court of arbitration to which disputes shall be referred
shall sbe the Permanent Court of International Justice at The
Hague, unless in any particular case the two Contracting Parties
agree otherwise.”

Declaration of July 16th, 1926

“It is well understood that the Treaty of Commerce and Navi-
gation between Great Britain and Greece of to-day’s date does not
prejudice claims on behalf of private persons based on the provi-

into force. The Court cannot accept this theory for the following
reasons :

(i) To accept this theory would mean giving retroactive effect to
Article 29 of the Treaty of 1926, whereas Article 32 of this Treaty
states that the Treaty, which must mean all the provisions of the
Treaty, shall come into force immediately upon ratification. Such a
conclusion might have been rebutted if there had been any special
clause or any special object necessitating retroactive interpretation.
There is no such clause or object in the present case. It is therefore
impossible to hold that any of its provisions must be deemed to
have been in force earlier.

It was contended on behalf of the Hellenic Government that the
arbitral procedure stipulated in Article 29 of the Treaty of 1926
differed from that in the Protocol of 1886 only in respect of the
tribunal provided for arbitration : under the Treaty of 1926 the
arbitral tribunal was to be the Permanent Court of International



Justice, while under the Protocol of 1886 the tribunal was to be an
ad hoc commission of arbitration. This, it was argued, was a proce-
dural variation and in matters of procedure, at least in English law,
the presumption as to procedural statutes is in favour of retroactive
application. Now, whatever may be the position in national law in
various countries of the world—a matter which the Court has
not thought it necessary to investigate—and without examining
whether questions of procedure cover questions of jurisdiction, the
Court observes that, in any event, the language of Article 32 of
the Treaty of 1926 precludes any retroactive effect being given to
selected provisions of that Treaty.

(i) Accompanying the Treaty of 1926—whether as a part thereof
or not is a question which will be dealt with later—was a Declara-
tion which provided, in effect, that any differences which might
arise as to the validity of claims based on the Treaty of 1886 should
be referred, at the request of either Government, to arbitration
under the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of 1886. That was the
understanding between the Parties. The language of the Decla-
ration makes no distinction between claims based on one class of
provisions of the 1886 Treaty and those based on another class ;
they are all placed on the same footing and differences relating to
their validity are referable to arbitration under the Protocol of 1886.
To argue that differences relating to claims based on those of the
provisions of the earlier Treaty, which were similar to provisions of
the later Treaty, were intended to be referred to arbitration in
accordance with Article 29 of the later Treaty, while differences
relating to other claims based on the earlier Treaty were meant to
be arbitrated under the Protocol of the earlier Treaty, introduces a
distinction for which the Court sees no justification in the plain
language of the Declaration.

The fifth point raised on behalf of the United Kingdom Govern-
ment is that :

“The Declaration which was signed at the same time as the Treaty
of 1026 was not a part of that Treaty and the provisions of that
Declaration are not provisions of that Treaty within the meaning of
Article 29.”

Both Parties agree that this is the most important issue in the
case. In support of the contention that the Declaration is not a
part of the Treaty, it is said that the Declaration was signed
separately from the Treaty proper, though by the same signatories
and on the same day. It is also pointed out that the Declaration
refers to the Treaty not as ‘‘this Treaty’ or ‘‘the present Treaty’ —
which would have been the proper mode of reference if the Declara-
tion had been regarded as part of the Treaty—but as ‘the Treaty



. of to-day’s date”, thereby indicating that the Treaty had
already been completed and signed. Moreover, it is urged, the
Declaration does not say that it is to be regarded as a part of the
Treaty, presenting in this respect a marked contrast to one of the
Declarations annexed to the Greco-Italian Commercial Treaty of
November 24th, 1926, which is followed by two Declarations, one
expressed to be an integral part of the Treaty and the other not so
expressed, the latter being almost identical in form and purpose
with the 1926 Anglo-Greek Declaration with which the Court is now
concerned.

On the other hand, it is to be noted that the Plenipotentiaries
included the Treaty and the Customs Schedule (which is unques-
tionably a part of the Treaty) and the Declaration in a single docu-
ment of 44 pages, the Declaration being on page 44. Again, shortly
after the exchange of ratifications, the Government of the United
Kingdom issued Treaty Series No. 2 (1927), a single document
entitled “Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United
Kingdom and Greece and accompanying Declaration”, and pre-
sented it to Parliament. Furthermore, the British Foreign Office and
the Chargé d’Affaires of the Hellenic Republic at Berne commun-
icated official texts to the League of Nations at Geneva for registra-
tion, which led to their inclusion in the League of Nations Treaty
Series under a single number, as ‘No. 1425. Treaty of Commerce
and Navigation between the United Kingdom and Greece and
accompanving Declaration signed at London, July 16th, 1926.”

Cogent evidence as to what both Parties intended is furnished by
the instruments of ratification exchanged between the United King-
dom and Greece. The instrument of ratification by Greece was in
the following terms : “We declare that the Treaty of Commerce and
Navigation having been signed in London on the 16th July of this
year between Greece and Great Britain with annexed Customs
Schedule and Declaration, the texts of which follow : [Here follow
the Greek and English texts of the Treaty, Schedule and Decla-
ration.] We accept, approve and ratify the Treaty, the Customs
Schedule and the Declaration in all their provisions, promising to
faithfully observe and not to violate the same, or to permit their
violation by any other person whatsoever”, etc.

Thus, this instrument made no distinction between the Treaty,
on the one hand, and the Customs Schedule which is indisputably a
part of the Treaty, and the Declaration annexed to the Treaty, on
the other. It is clear, therefore, that Greece treated the Declaration
as a part of the Treaty.



The United Kingdom's instrument of ratification is even more
explicit. It reads: “GEORGE, by the Grace of God .... greeting.
Whereas a Treaty between Us and Our good friend the President
of the Hellenic Republic, relative to commerce and navigation,
was concluded and signed at London on the sixteenth day of
July in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and
twenty-six by the Plenipotentiaries of Us and of Our said good
friend duly and respectively authorized for that purpose, which
Treaty is, word for word, as follows: {here follow the English
and Greek texts of the Treaty, Schedule and Declaration.]

“We, having seen and considered the Treaty aforesaid, have
approved, accepted and confirmed the same in all and every one
of its articles and clauses”, etc.

From the words “which Treaty is, word for word, as follows”
and the text that follows the words, it is clear that the United
Kingdom also regarded the Declaration, as well as the Customs
Schedule, as included in the Treaty. The ratification of a treaty
which provides for ratification, as does the Treaty of 1926, is an
indispensable condition for bringing it into operation. It is not,
therefore, a mere formal act, but an act of vital importance. When
the Government of the United Kingdom speaks of the Treaty in
its own instrument of ratification, as being “word for word as
follows” and includes the Declaration in the text that follows,
it is not possible for the Court to hold that the Declaration is not
included in the Treaty.

by thirteen votes to two,

finds that it is without jurisdiction to decide on the merits of
the Ambatielos claim ;

by ten votes to five,

finds that it has jurisdiction to decide whether the United
Kingdom is under an obligation to submit to arbitration, in accord-
ance with the Declaration of 1926, the difference as to the validity
of the Ambatielos claim, in so far as this claim is based on the
Treaty of 1886;

decides that the time-limits for the filing of a Reply and a
Rejoinder shall be fixed by subsequent Order.
