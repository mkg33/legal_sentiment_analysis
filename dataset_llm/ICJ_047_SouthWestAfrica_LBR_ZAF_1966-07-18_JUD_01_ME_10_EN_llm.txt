The Court in its Judgment finds that the Applicants cannot be con-
sidered to have established any substantive right or legal interest apper-
taining to them in the subject-matter of the present claims and that for
that reason the claims must be rejected. I regret I find myself unable,
for reasons which I shall hereinafter state, to agree with those conclusions
and the motivation behind them.

I hold the view that when the Court has found that the dispute in the
present cases is within the ambit of the compromissory clause, Article 7
(2) of the Mandate, as it did in its 1962 Judgment on the preliminary
objections, the Applicants do not have to show again in order to succeed
that they have individual legal interests in the subject-matter of the
dispute unless their claims are founded on damage or prejudice to such
interests; and secondly, that a general interest in the proper carrying out
of the terms of a multilateral treaty like the Mandate is sufficient legal
interest on which an applicant can found its claim.

In their final submissions, the Applicants deleted the above five
submissions and substituted Submissions 3 and 4 which read as follows:

“(3) Respondent, by laws and regulations, and official methods
and measures, which are set out in the pleadings herein, has practised
apartheid, ie, has distinguished as to race, colour, national or
tribal origin in establishing the rights and duties of the inhabitants
of the Territory; that such practice is in violation of its obligations
as stated in Article 2 of the Mandate and Article 22 of the Covenant
of the League of Nations; and that Respondent has the duty forth-
with to cease the practice of apartheid in the Territory.

(4) Respondent, by virtue of economic, political, social and edu-
cational policies applied within the Territory, by means of laws
and regulations, and official methods and measures, which are set
out in the pleadings herein, has, in the light of applicable inter-
national standards or international legal norm, or both, failed to
promote to the utmost the material and moral well-being and social
progress of the inhabitants of the Territory; that its failure to do so
is in violation of its obligations as stated in Article 2 of the Mandate
and Article 22 of the Covenant; and that Respondent has the duty
forthwith to cease its violations as aforesaid and to take all practi-
cable action to fulfil its duties under such Articles.”

The gravamen of the Applicants’ complaint in both sets of submissions
is the practice of apartheid which they say is, by its nature, oppressive,
arbitrary and inhuman, and, therefore, incompatible with the Respon-
dent’s obligations under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate. That
complaint has not changed and remains the same in the original as well
as in the final submissions.

The Applicants by the amendments say that as a matter of governmental
policy they are, judged by acceptable international norms and/or stan-
dards, in violation of the Respondent’s Mandate obligations. By doing
so the Applicants were introducing a measure by which the conduct of
the Respondent should be jugded. What the amendments have done is
to bring out the essentially legal character of the dispute as one relating
to the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Mandate.
They have not in any material sense altered the basic complaint of the
Applicants which is that the practice of apartheid is discriminatory,
unwarranted, inhuman and, therefore, inherently and per se incompatible
with, and in violation of, Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate. The
obligation of the Mandatory under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate
to promote to the utmost the material and moral well-being and the
social progress of the inhabitants of the territory is in terms mandatory
and any action of the Respondent with respect to the Territory must be
judged in that light.

I think it convenient to say straight away that I hold the view that the
Applicants have established sufficient legal interest in the subject-matter
of the claim to entitle them, on the evidence before the Court, to succeed
in some, if not all, of the claims; in particular, I hold that the following
claims have on the evidence and the law been established and that the
Court should have pronounced favourably on them:

(a) that South West Africa is a territory under the Mandate assumed
by the Respondent on 17 December 1920;



(b) that the Respondent continues to have the international obligations
stated in Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and
in the Mandate for South West Africa;

(e) that the policy of apartheid is inherently incompatible with the
mandate obligations of the Respondent and that the Respondent
by practising apartheid has violated its obligations as stated in
Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate;

(d) that the Respondent is legally bound not to modify or to attempt
to modify or to terminate the Mandate without the consent of the
United Nations;

(e) that the Respondent is accountable to the United Nations for the
proper discharge of its obligations under the Mandate and that the
United Nations has a corresponding right of supervision;

(f) that the Respondent has a legal obligation to report to the United
Nations.

I feel rather unhappy about the Court’s analysis of the mandates
system. It pays little attention to the ideals of the Mandate and devotes
a disproportionate amount of space to details. The approach, if I may
be permitted to draw an analogy, is like that of an artist who, perhaps
unconsciously, has distorted the appearance of a building by. over-
emphasizing details of sections of it. The emphasis, it seems to me,
should be on the appearance and framework and not on the components,
some of which might not be necessary to support or characterize the
building.

In its Judgment the Court begins with two fine but in my view un-
necessary distinctions: firstly, a distinction between the Applicants’
standing in the present phase of the proceedings and their standing
before the Court itself and says that the latter was the subject of the
Court’s decision of 1962. This distinction ignores the fact that the
Applicants’ standing before the Court dealt with in the 1962 Judgment
was in respect of the same dispute which the Court has to decide in the
present phase of the proceedings. The Applicants in respect of that
dispute have no two standings before the Court. The need to establish a



substantive right or legal interest in the merits phase of the case will,
in the circumstances of the present case, arise only if, as a matter of
evidence, it is necessary for proving any item of the Applicants’ claims.
That is not the case here where the Applicants have claimed no damages
and where their request is for a declaratory judgment. The question of
Applicants’ interest was treated by the Parties and by this Court in 1962
as an element of the issue of the capacity of the Applicants to invoke
the compromissory clause in respect of the present dispute. The Court
in the present Judgment, although it says that the question of Applicants’
legal interest is an issue on the merits, deals with it in the context of the
scope and applicability of Article 7 (2)—an approach which relates
more to admissibility than to the merits.

Secondly, the Court draws a distinction between what it terms “con-
duct” and “special interests” provisions of the mandate instrument,
and imports the distinction into its interpretation of Article 7 (2) of the
Mandate. Article 7 (2) is a compromissory clause and does not, as it
stands, permit of any such distinction. To do so, as I shall show later,
is to do violence to the actual words of the text and is in the circumstances
impermissible.

The Court’s interpretation of the Mandate, pursued to its logical
conclusion, leaves the Mandatory without any enforceable obligations
except in relation to Article 5 of the Mandate. It is stated in the Judgment
that it was never contemplated that the Council of the League should
ever impose its views on the Mandatory or that the “conduct” clauses
should be subject to adjudication under the compromissory clause of
Article 7 (2). On that view the Mandatory could become as intransigent
as it wished, and could ignore the decisions of the Council of the League
and even modify the terms of the Mandate without any legal sanction.
The only legal sanction envisaged, according to the Judgment, is in
respect of what it calls “special interests” provisions. The Respondent
had the right under the Covenant of the League to participate in the
proceedings of the Council of the League, when the latter was dealing
with matters appertaining to the Mandate for South West Africa and
could thus paralyse the proceedings of the Council by the use of its
right of veto. It is no answer to say that this had not happened throughout
the League’s existence. The fact is that it could have happened and, if
it did, the legal consequences would have been, in the Court’s opinion,
as stated in the Judgment. A consequence of the Court’s interpretation,
if all the Council has to do is to use persuasion on the Respondent,
would be to place the Mandate, juridically, on the same plane with
annexation, the very thing that was condemned by the Peace Treaties,
and which the Principal Allied and Associated Powers wished to avoid
by the creation of the Mandates. If the view expressed in the Judgment
was what the Principal Allied and Associated Powers had in mind when
they set up the mandates system and agreed to Article 7 (2) of the
Mandate for South West Africa, then the operation would appear to look



like a form of chicanery practised on mankind in the name of civilization
—a subterfuge “intended to avoid, through its operation, the appearance
of taking enemy territory as spoils of war”. I do not, however, believe
that that was so and, for that reason, I feel I cannot associate myself
with the Court’s interpretation of the Mandate.

This Court in its Advisory Opinion of 1950 on the Status of South
West Africa said of the Mandate (p. 132):

“The terms of this Mandate, as well as the provisions of Article 22
of the Covenant and the principles embodied therein, show that
the creation of this new international institution did not involve
any cession of territory or transfer of sovereignty to the Union
of South Africa. The Union Government was to exercise an inter-
national function of administration on behalf of the League,
with the object of promoting the well-being and development of
the inhabitants.”

And again in 1962 in its Judgment on the preliminary objections the
Court stated (p. 329):

“The essential principles of the Mandates System consist chiefly
in the recognition of certain rights of the peoples of the under-
developed territories; the establishment of a regime of tutelage for
each of such peoples to be exercised by an advanced nation as a
‘Mandatory’ ‘on behalf of the League of Nations’; and the re-
cognition of ‘a sacred trust of civilization’ laid upon the League
as an organized international community and upon its Member
States. This system is dedicated to the avowed object of promoting
the well-being and development of the peoples concerned and is
fortified by setting up safeguards for the protection of their rights.”

I consider the idea of the sacred trust of civilization given juridical
expression in the mandates system and, in particular, in the “conduct”
clauses, more important and more deserving of judicial protection than
the “special interests” of members of the League. Speaking juridically
such concepts as “rights”, “duties” and “obligations” have no meaning
or effect unless they are legally cognizable, and enforceable in a court
of law.

The League may, in a sense, therefore, be likened to a members’ club
(and here I have in mind the common law concept of such clubs). Any



member of a club can sue for the club’s properties and can by appropriate
action restrain the officers of the club from acting contrary to the aims
and purposes of the club. A member can even proceed against an agent
of the club or a third person in order to protect or recover the club’s
property where the officers of the club fail to do so. That, however,
does not mean that the club cannot legally act as a body through its
executive or trustees, or that it has ceased to possess a separate function.
If the analogy of a members’ club is in that limited sense accepted,
I do not see anything extraordinary in the provision of Article 7 (2)
of the Mandate allowing a member of the League to refer to court
any dispute with the Mandatory, whether or not it relates to what the
Court calls the “conduct” or “special interests” provisions relating
to the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Mandate,
especially as by Article 34 of the Court’s Statute the League, not being
a State, could not itself be a party to an action in the International
Court. Only States or members of the League could be parties in cases
before the Court.

Judgment for adopting such a course. This is particularly important
since the question of Applicants’ legal interest is not an issue for decision
upon the evidence required in support of any of the claims in the Appli-
cants’ final submissions. The Respondent has throughout regarded the
question of Applicants’ legal interest as an issue relevant in the context
of the scope and applicability of Article 7 (2) of the Mandate, and as
such an issue of admissibility. It was in that respect that the issue was
raised and decided in the 1962 Judgment.

In the Judgment of the Court in the present phase of the proceedings
it is stated that the issue before the Court in 1962 was essentially one of
the capacity of the Applicants to invoke the jurisdictional clause and
that the only test of capacity predicated by this clause, the only qualifica-
tion required by it to be fulfilled ratione personae, was that the Applicants
should be members of the League. The Court, in my view, went further
than that, as indeed it was required to do by the Respondent’s submis-
sions, and held that the dispute before it was within the ambit of the
jurisdictional clause, ratione materige. The nature of the dispute appeared
clearly in the Applications and it was on that basis that the Respondent

said that, the Applicants would not, in my view, be required to show
further, as a matter of evidence, that they have a substantive right or
legal interest in the subject-matter of the claim. They would be required
to do so only if they were alleging damage or prejudice to their individual
interests. What the Applicants are asking the Court to do is to declare
that on a proper interpretation of certain provisions of the Mandate the



Respondent by its laws, policies and measures has committed breaches
of those provisions. I find myself unable to accept the view that with
respect to the same dispute the Applicants will have the capacity to
bring the dispute before the Court but cannot recover unless they can
show that their substantive rights or legal interests were directly involved
or prejudiced, even though they have not alleged any damage and have
not asked for reparation.

The Article reads:

“The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should
arise between the Mandatory and another Member of the League
of Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of
the provisions of the Mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled
by negotiation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of
International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant
of the League of Nations.”

nection it may be mentioned, although that point has not been taken up
in the arguments that the apartheid residential laws of the Respondent
in the mandated territory of South West Africa would adversely affect
the freedom of movement of any nationals of the Applicant States who,
not being “Whites” within the census classification of South West Africa,
may choose to go there in the exercise of the rights given to nationals
of members of the League under Article 5 of the Mandate in the same
way as they affect the “Natives” of the territory. “Natives” by the
census classification, as has been noted above, are persons who in fact
are, or who are generally accepted as members of any aboriginal race or
tribe of Africa.

Under the segregation laws Natives can only live in areas set apart
for them. Natives living on land reserved for “European” owned
commercial firms at the time of its allocation may be required under
the land settlement laws either to move or to work for the “European”
firm. A Native missionary from any of the Applicant States will not
enjoy the same or equal right of residence within the territory as a White
missionary. He will be subject to all the apartheid discriminatory laws.
The Minister of Native Affairs has certain powers over “Natives” (in-
cluding “Native” missionaries) which he does not have over “White”
missionaries. It is appreciated that no issue has been raised about
missionaries, if any, from Applicant States, but the question whether
or not the Mandate survives or can unilaterally be modified, which are
some of the issues for decision on the Applicants’ claims, can have
consequences which are likely to affect the rights of nationals of the
Applicant States going to the territory to exercise any of the rights
allowed them under Article 5 of the Mandate. But that notwithstanding,
the Applicants as members of the League have severally an interest in

interpretation of the will of the General Assembly and the parties.



The objects of such a convention must also be considered. The
Convention was manifestly adopted for a purely humanitarian and
civilizing purpose. It is indeed difficult to imagine a convention
that might have this dual character to a greater degree, since its
object on the one hand is to safeguard the very existence of certain
human groups and on the other to confirm and endorse the most
elementary principles of morality. In such a convention the con-
tracting States do not have any interest of their own; they merely
have, one and all, a common interest, namely the accomplishment
of those high purposes which are the raison d’étre of the Convention.
Consequently, in a convention of this type one cannot speak of
individual advantages or disadvantages to States, or of the mainten-
ance of a perfect contractual balance between rights and duties.
The high ideals which inspired the Convention provide, by virtue
of the common will of the parties, the foundation and measure of
all its provisions.”


It has been said that nowhere in the Mandate was it stated that
members of the League should have the right of protecting the Mandate.
The answer is that it does not need to be so stated. The existence of such
a right is inherent in the very act of creating the Mandate on behalf of
the League and Article 7 (2) emphasizes the existence of such a right in
the members of the League. It seems to me that this is a logical reason



for drafting Article 7 (2) in such wide terms. Article 7 (2) of the Mandate
as a provision of the Mandate should be interpreted in a manner to
ensure the purpose of the Mandate. To do otherwise would be to corrupt
both the letter and the spirit of the Article.

The members of the League have, by virtue of their membership, a
common interest in the proper exercise of the Mandate. That interest
is a legal one and in the light of Article 7 (2) gives each member the
right to take a delinquent Mandatory to court.

The Applicants are asking the Court to declare that certain actions
of the Respondent as listed in the Memorials and in the oral hearings
amount to a breach of the obligations of the Respondent as Mandatory
under the Mandate. Assuming that the League was still in existence
and a situation was reached as is the case now, where the Respondent
was bent on pursuing policies which the overwhelming majority of
members of the League felt were out of line with its mandate obligations,
at the same time maintaining that its policies were not in breach of the
mandate provisions and would not agree to change them or agree to
any compromise solution, how was the difference to be resolved? The
Judgment says that the Mandate provides no remedy for such a situation
and that is was a risk the League members took with their eyes wide
open. It seems to me that it was to meet such a situation that Article 7 (2)
was introduced. The League itself cannot invoke the compromissory
clause and I see nothing incompatible with Article 7 (2) in any member
of the League who wished to carry the burden, making the difference
or dispute its own and invoking the compromissory clause in order to
ensure due compliance with the terms of the Mandate. To invoke the
clause in such circumstances does not and cannot destroy the character
of the League nor that of the Mandate. On the contrary, it would be in
keeping with its duty as a member of the League to do so for the safe-
guarding of the sacred trust to which it had subscribed.
