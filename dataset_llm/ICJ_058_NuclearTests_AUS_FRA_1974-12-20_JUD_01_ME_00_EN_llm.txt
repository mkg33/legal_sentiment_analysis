the Court's Order of 22 June 1973, by which the Parties were called upon
to argue, in the first instance, questions of the jurisdiction of the Court
and the admissibility of the Application. For this reason, as already
indicated, not only the Parties but also the Court itself must refrain from
entering into the merits of the claim. However, while examining these
questions of a preliminary character, the Court is entitled, and in some
circumstances may be required, to go into other questions which may not
be strictly capable of classification as matters of jurisdiction or admis-
sibility but are of such a nature as to require examination in priority to
those matters.

23. In this connection, it should be emphasized that the Court pos-
sesses an inherent jurisdiction enabling it to take such action as may be
required, on the one hand to ensure that the exercise of its jurisdiction
over the merits, if and when established, shall not be frustrated, and on
the other, to provide for the orderly settlement of all matters in dispute,
to ensure the observance of the “inherent limitations on the exercise of
the judicial function” of the Court, and to “maintain its judicial char-
acter” (Northern Cameroons, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, at p. 29).
Such inherent jurisdiction, on the basis of which the Court is fully
empowered to make whatever findings may be necessary for the purposes
just indicated, derives from the mere existence of the Court as a judicial



organ established by the consent of States, and is conferred upon it in
order that its basic judicial functions may be safeguarded.

24. With these considerations in mind, the Court has first to examine
a question which it finds to be essentially preliminary, namely the exis-
tence of a dispute, for, whether or not the Court has jurisdiction in the
present case, the resolution of that question could exert a decisive in-
fluence on the continuation of the proceedings. It will therefore be neces-
sary to make a detailed analysis of the claim submitted to the Court by
the Application of Australia. The present phase of the proceedings
having been devoted solely to preliminary questions, the Applicant has
not had the opportunity of fully expounding its contentions on the
merits. However the Application, which is required by Article 40 of the
Statute of the Court to indicate “the subject of the dispute”, must be the
point of reference for the consideration by the Court of the nature and
existence of the dispute brought before it.

29. In the light of these statements, it is essential to consider whether
the Government of Australia requests a judgment by the Court which
would only state the legal relationship between the Applicant and the
Respondent with regard to the matters in issue, or a judgment of a type
which in terms requires one or both of the Parties to take, or refrain from
taking, some action. Thus it is the Court’s duty to isolate the real issue in
the case and to identify the object of the claim. It has never been con-
tested that the Court is entitled to interpret the submissions of the parties,
and in fact is bound to do so; this is one of the attributes of its judicial
functions. It is true that, when the claim is not properly formulated
because the submissions of the parties are inadequate, the Court has no
power to “‘substitute itself for them and formulate new submissions
simply on the basis of arguments and facts advanced” (P.C.1.J., Series A,
No. 7, p. 35), but that is not the case here, nor is it a case of the reformula-
tion of submissions by the Court. The Court has on the other hand
repeatedly exercised the power to exclude, when necessary, certain con-
tentions or arguments which were advanced by a party as part of the
submissions, but which were regarded by the Court, not as indications of
what the party was asking the Court to decide, but as reasons advanced
why the Court should decide in the sense contended for by that party.
Thus in the Fisheries case, the Court said of nine of the thirteen points in
the Applicant's submissions: “These are elements which might furnish
reasons in support of the Judgment, but cannot constitute the decision”



(1.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 126). Similarly in the Minquiers and Ecrehos case,


“The Submissions reproduced above and presented by the United
Kingdom Government consist of three paragraphs, the last two
being reasons underlying the first, which must be regarded as the
final Submission of that Government. The Submissions of the French
Government consist of ten paragraphs, the first nine being reasons
leading up to the last, which must be regarded as the final Submis-
sion of that Government.” (I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 52; see also
Nottebohm, Second Phase, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1955, p. 16.)

30. In the circumstances of the present case, although the Applicant
has in its Application used the traditional formula of asking the Court
“to adjudge and declare’ (a formula similar to those used in the cases
quoted in the previous paragraph), the Court must ascertain the true
object and purpose of the claim and in doing so it cannot confine itself
to the ordinary meaning of the words used; it must take into account the
Application as a whole, the arguments of the Applicant before the Court,
the diplomatic exchanges brought to the Court’s attention, and public
statements made on behalf of the applicant Government. If these clearly
circumscribe the object of the claim, the interpretation of the submissions
must necessarily be affected. In the present case, it is evident that the
fons et origo of the case was the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by
France in the South Pacific region, and that the original and ultimate
objective of the Applicant was and has remained to obtain a termination
of those tests; thus its claim cannot be regarded as being a claim for a
declaratory judgment. While the judgment of the Court which Australia
seeks to obtain would in its view have been based on a finding by the
Court on questions of law, such finding would be only a means to an end,
and not an end in itself. The Court is of course aware of the role of
declaratory judgments, but the present case is not one in which such a
judgment is requested.

consistent public statements concerning future tests, which provide
material facilitating the Court’s task of assessing the Applicant’s interpre-
tation of the earlier documents, and which indeed require to be examined
in order to discern whether they embody any modification of intention as
to France’s future conduct. It is true that these statements have not been
made before the Court, but they are in the public domain, and are
known to the Australian Government, and one of them was commented
on by the Attorney-General in the Australian Senate on 26 September
1974. It will clearly be necessary to consider all these statements, both that
drawn to the Court’s attention in July 1974 and those subsequently made.

33. It would no doubt have been possible for the Court, had it con-
sidered that the interests of justice so required, to have afforded the
Parties the opportunity, e.g., by reopening the oral proceedings, of
addressing to the Court comments on the statements made since the close
of those proceedings. Such a course however would have been fully
justified only if the matter dealt with in those statements had been
completely new, had not been raised during the proceedings, or was
unknown to the Parties. This is manifestly not the case. The essential
material which the Court must examine was introduced into the proceed-
ings by the Applicant itself, by no means incidentally, during the course
of the hearings, when it drew the Court’s attention to a statement by the
French authorities made prior to that date, submitted the documents
containing it and presented an interpretation of its character, touching
particularly upon the question whether it contained a firm assurance.
Thus both the statement and the Australian interpretation of it are before



the Court pursuant to action by the Applicant. Moreover, the Applicant


42. Before considering whether the declarations made by the French
authorities meet the object of the claim by the Applicant that no further
atmospheric nuclear tests should be carried out in the South Pacific, it is
first necessary to determine the status and scope on the international plane
of these declarations.

43. It is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral
acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating
legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very
specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that
it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on
the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being
thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with
the declaration. An undertaking of this kind, if given publicly, and with
an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of inter-
national negotiations, is binding. In these circumstances, nothing in the
nature of a quid pro quo nor any subsequent acceptance of the declaration,
nor even any reply or reaction from other States, is required for the
declaration to take effect, since such a requirement would be inconsistent
with the strictly unilateral nature of the juridical act by which the pro-
nouncement by the State was made.

44. Of course, not all unilateral acts imply obligation; but a State may
choose to take up a certain position in relation to a particular matter
with the intention of being bound—the intention is to be ascertained by
interpretation of the act. When States make statements by which their
freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is called for.

45. With regard to the question of form, it should be observed that
this is not a domain in which international law imposes any special or
strict requirements. Whether a statement is made orally or in writing
makes no essential difference, for such statements made in particular
circumstances may create commitments in international law, which does
not require that they should be couched in written form. Thus the ques-



tion of form is not decisive. As the Court said in its Judgment on the
preliminary objections in the case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear:

“Where ... as is generally the case in international law, which
places the principal emphasis on the intentions of the parties, the
law prescribes no particular form, parties are free to choose what
form they please provided their intention clearly results from it.”


The Court further stated in the same case: ‘“. . . the sole relevant question
is whether the language employed in any given declaration does reveal a
clear intention . . .” (ibid., p. 32).

46. One of the basic principles governing the creation and perfor-
mance of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of
good faith. Trust and confidence are inherent in international co-opera-
tion, in particular in an age when this co-operation in many fields is
becoming increasingly essential. Just as the very rule of pacta sunt
servanda in the law of treaties is based on good faith, so also is the binding
character of an international obligation assumed by unilateral declara-
tion. Thus interested States may take cognizance of unilateral declarations
and place confidence in them, and are entitled to require that the obli-


47. Having examined the legal principles involved, the Court will now
turn to the particular statements made by the French Government. The
Government of Australia has made known to the Court at the oral
proceedings its own interpretation of the first such statement (paragraph
27 above). As to subsequent statements, reference may be made to what
was said in the Australian Senate by the Attorney-General on 26 Sep-
tember 1974 (paragraph 28 above). In reply to a question concerning
reports that France had announced that it had finished atmospheric
nuclear testing, he said that the statement of the French Foreign Minister
on 25 September (paragraph 39 above) “falls far short of an undertaking
that there will be no more atmospheric tests conducted by the French
Government at its Pacific Tests Centre” and that France was “still re-
serving to itself the right to carry out atmospheric nuclear tests’ so that
“In legal terms, Australia has nothing from the French Government
which protects it against any further atmospheric tests”.

declaration which may create a legal obligation, and cannot in this res-
pect be bound by the view expressed by another State which is in no way
a party to the text.

49. Of the statements by the French Government now before the
Court, the most essential are clearly those made by the President of the
Republic. There can be no doubt, in view of his functions, that his public
communications or statements, oral or written, as Head of State, are in
international relations acts of the French State. His statements, and those
of members of the French Government acting under his authority, up to
the last statement made by the Minister of Defence (of 11 October 1974),
constitute a whole. Thus, in whatever form these statements were ex-
pressed, they must be held to constitute an engagement of the State,

51. In announcing that the 1974 series of atmospheric tests would be
the last, the French Government conveyed to the world at large, including
the Applicant, its intention effectively to terminate these tests. It was
bound to assume that other States might take note of these statements
and rely on their being effective. The validity of these statements and
their legal consequences must be considered within the general frame-
work of the security of international intercourse, and the confidence and
trust which are so essential in the relations among States. It is from the
actual substance of these statements, and from the circumstances atten-
ding their making, that the legal implications of the unilateral act must be
deduced. The objects of these statements are clear and they were addressed
to the international community as a whole, and the Court holds that they
constitute an undertaking possessing legal effect. The Court considers

of atmospheric tests, gave an undertaking to the international community
to which his words were addressed. It is true that the French Government
has consistently maintained, for example in a Note dated 7 February 1973
from the French Ambassador in Canberra to the Prime Minister and
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, that it “has the conviction that
its nuclear experiments have not violated any rule of international law”,
nor did France recognize that it was bound by any rule of international
law to terminate its tests, but this does not affect the legal consequences
of the statements examined above. The Court finds that the unilateral
undertaking resulting from these statements cannot be interpreted as
having been made in implicit reliance on an arbitrary power of reconsi-
deration. The Court finds further that the French Government has under-
taken an obligation the precise nature and limits of which must be under-
stood in accordance with the actual terms in which they have been
publicly expressed.

Court (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and
Romania (First Phase), Advisory Opinion, 1.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).
The dispute brought before it must therefore continue to exist at the time
when the Court makes its decision. It must not fail to take cognizance of a
situation in which the dispute has disappeared because the object of the
claim has been achieved by other means. If the declarations of France
concerning the effective cessation of the nuclear tests have the significance
described by the Court, that is to say if they have caused the dispute to
disappear, all the necessary consequences must be drawn from this
finding.

56. It may be argued that although France may have undertaken such
an obligation, by a unilateral declaration, not to carry out atmospheric
nuclear tests in the South Pacific Ocean, a judgment of the Court on this
subject might still be of value because, if the judgment upheld the Appli-

affirming the obligation of the Respondent. However, the Court having
found that the Respondent has assumed an obligation as to conduct,
concerning the effective cessation of nuclear tests, no further judicial
action is required. The Applicant has repeatedly sought from the Res-
pondent an assurance that the tests would cease, and the Respondent
has, on its own initiative, made a series of statements to the effect that
they will cease. Thus the Court concludes that, the dispute having disap-
peared, the claim advanced by Australia no longer has any object. It fol-
lows that any further finding would have no raison d’étre.

57. This is not to say that the Court may select from the cases sub-
mitted to it those it feels suitable for judgment while refusing to give
judgment in others. Article 38 of the Court’s Statute provides that its
function is ‘“to decide in accordance with international law such disputes
as are submitted to it”; but not only Article 38 itself but other provisions

jurisdiction in contentious proceedings only when a dispute genuinely
exists between the parties. In refraining from further action in this case
the Court is therefore merely acting in accordance with the proper inter-
pretation of its judicial function.

58. The Court has in the past indicated considerations which would
lead it to decline to give judgment. The present case is one in which
“circumstances that have . .. arisen render any adjudication devoid of
purpose” (Northern Cameroons, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 38).
The Court therefore sees no reason to allow the continuance of proceed-
ings which it knows are bound to be fruitless. While judicial settlement
may provide a path to international harmony in circumstances of conflict,

obstacle to such harmony.

59. Thus the Court finds that no further pronouncement is required



in the present case. It does not enter into the adjudicatory functions of the
Court to deal with issues in abstracto, once it has reached the conclusion
that the merits of the case no longer fall to be determined. The object of

60. Once the Court has found that a State has entered into a commit-
ment concerning its future conduct it is not the Court’s function to
contemplate that it will not comply with it. However, the Court observes
that if the basis of this Judgment were to be affected, the Applicant could
request an examination of the situation in accordance with the provisions
of the Statute; the denunciation by France, by letter dated 2 January
1974, of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Dis-
putes, which is relied on as a basis of jurisdiction in the present case,
