                    1. Although I generally agree with the principles and rules applicable
                to the assessment of reparations in this case and to the questions of proof
                set out by the Court under the heading “General considerations”,
                I believe that a better application of those principles, both in the assess-
                ment of the evidence and in the determination of the amount of repara-
                tion due, could have made it possible to achieve a fairer compensation.
                    2. In terms of principles, the Judgment pertinently emphasizes that
                although the Court has previously recalled that, “as a general rule, it is
                for the party which alleges a fact in support of its claims to prove the
                existence of that fact”, it has also indicated that this is not an absolute
                principle, applicable in all circumstances. Indeed, the Court has held that
                “this general rule may be applied flexibly in certain circumstances, where,
                for example, the respondent may be in a better position to establish cer-
                tain facts” (Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border
                Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                2018 (I), p. 26, para. 33; Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.
                Democratic Republic of the Congo), Compensation, Judgment,
                I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I), p. 332, para. 15), depending on “the subject‑­
                matter and the nature of each dispute brought before the Court” and
                “the type of facts which it is necessary to establish for the purposes of the
                decision of the case” (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.
                ­Democratic Republic of the Congo), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                 2010 (II), p. 660, para. 54).
                    3. Additionally, the Court claims that it is not ignoring the evidentiary
                 difficulties that occur “in most situations of international armed conflict”
                 and that it recalls in paragraphs 66 and 67 of the Judgment. Following
                 this, the Court affirms that it “will take the context of this case into
                 account when determining the extent of the injury and assessing the repa-
                 ration owed” (Judgment, para. 68).
                    4. This flexible approach is particularly suitable for reparation pro­
                 cedures when, as in the present case, the Court has established at an earlier
                 stage of the proceedings the existence of “massive human rights violations
                 and grave breaches of international humanitarian law” (Armed Activities
                 on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.





6 Ord_1239.indb 349                                                                                  27/06/23 08:16

                Uganda), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 239, para. 207). This conclu-
                sion is shared by many international courts which, in similar circum-
                stances, have generally shown reasonable flexibility on this issue in order
                to be able to guarantee fair compensation to the victims.

                   5. The Court thus aptly recalls the case law of the Appeals Chamber of
                the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) in the Katanga case, which
                concerned facts occurring in the same armed conflict and where the
                Appeals Chamber took into account the inability of victims to provide
                documentary evidence in support of all the alleged harms in light of the
                prevailing circumstances in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
                (“DRC”) (Judgment, para. 123).
                   6. Along the same lines, I also note that, in the Lubanga case (2015),
                the ICC Appeals Chamber observed that, with regard to the evidentiary
                standard in the reparations phase, it was appropriate to apply more flex-
                ible criteria than the requirement of “beyond [all] reasonable doubt”, and
                that several factors had to be taken into consideration, including recog-
                nizing the difficulty victims face in obtaining evidence in support of their
                claims due to its destruction 1. Similarly, in the reparations procedure in
                the Ntaganda case, the Appeals Chamber recalled that the “appropriate”
                standard of proof depended on the particular circumstances of the case 2,
                taking into consideration the difficulty involved in obtaining evidence as
                well. Therefore, in order to determine the standard of proof applicable in
                the reparations proceeding, the Appeals Chamber took into account the
                distinguishing features of the case, “specifically the difficulty victims may
                face in obtaining evidence in support of their claim due to the destruction
                or the unavailability of evidence in the relevant circumstances” 3. The
                Appeals Chamber thus underscored the relevance of the standard of
                proof known as the “balance of probabilities”. All that is required is for
                the court to be satisfied that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff
                suffered harm resulting from one of the crimes for which the defendant
                was convicted 4.

                  7. A similar approach was followed by the Eritrea‑Ethiopia Claims
                Commission, which avoided using a “mechanical process” with an overly
                demanding standard of proof pertaining to alleged damages that would,

                as such, have deprived the victims of fair compensation, while also pre-
                venting excessive requests 5. As the Commission noted,
                      “in connection with particular claims, the evidence regarding
                      such matters as the egregiousness or seriousness of the unlawful
                      action, the numbers of persons injured or property destroyed or dam-
                      aged by that action, and the financial consequences of such injury,
                      destruction or damage, is often uncertain or ambiguous. In such cir-
                      cumstances, the Commission has made the best estimates possible on
                      the basis of the available evidence. Like some national courts and
                      international legislators, it has recognized that when obligated to
                      determine appropriate compensation, it must do so even if the process
                      involves estimation, or even guesswork, within the range of possibil-
                      ities indicated by the evidence.” 6

                   8. This approach is consistent with the fundamental principles of jus-
                tice as recalled by the arbitral tribunal in the Trail Smelter case:

                         “Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascer-
                      tainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it would be a
                      perversion of fundamental principles of justice to deny all relief to the
                      injured person, and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from making any
                      amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages may not be deter-
                      mined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the evidence
                      show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable
                      inference, although the result be only approximate.” 7

                   9. As previously mentioned, the Court claims that it is aware of the
                difficulties relating to questions of proof which arise “in most situations
                of international armed conflict”, as it recalls in paragraphs 66 and 67 of
                the Judgment. The Court also states that it “will take the context of this
                case into account when determining the extent of the injury and assessing
                the reparation owed” (Judgment, para. 68).

                seem to have applied the above principles satisfactorily or to have suffi-
                ciently taken into consideration the context of this case, which ultimately
                prevents it from arriving at a just and equitable compensation.

                   11. Indeed, while it is careful to point this out, the Court does not suf-
                ficiently take into consideration the fact that the conflict occurred several
                decades ago, rendering the accessibility of relevant official documents
                more difficult; that evidence could have been destroyed as a result of the
                war or the elapsed time; that the DRC may have lacked the necessary
                resources to conduct investigations on its own territory; and that the low
                level of education of a majority of the victims and especially the adminis-
                trative context of the country prevented an effective accounting of all the
                damage suffered, including the loss of human life via official death certifi-
                cates or hospital records.
                   12. First, in assessing the evidence submitted by the DRC, the Court
                has been too strict, even severe, when highlighting the deficiencies in the
                evidence submitted by the Applicant, without really taking into consider-
                ation the context of the case. There is no doubt that the DRC has not
                always been able to provide evidence of a high degree of certainty in sup-
                port of its claims. In fact, the Applicant acknowledges this in a certain
                way when reminding the Court of the situation in which it had to collect
                the evidence, notably highlighting “its lack of resources, the continuing
                conflict on its territory, the trauma suffered by a large number of victims
                and their low level of education, the destruction and loss of evidence and
                other related difficulties” (Judgment, para. 62).

                   13. To my great regret, the Court does not seem to take full account of
                this context which should have led it to acknowledge, as it did in the
                Corfu Channel case, that the DRC, which was unable to furnish direct
                proof, could “be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and
                circumstantial evidence” (Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania),
                Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 18).
                   14. Thus, although the Court states in paragraph 159 of the Judgment
                that it is “aware that detailed proof of specific events that have occurred
                in a devastating war, in remote areas, and almost two decades ago, is
                often not available”, it nevertheless considers, and in a rather paradoxical
                way, that, “notwithstanding the difficult situation in which the DRC
                found itself, more evidence relating to loss of life could be expected to
                have been collected since the Court delivered its 2005 Judgment”. Simi-
                larly, it reiterates in paragraph 242, in relation to damage to property,
                that “notwithstanding the difficult situation in which the DRC found
                itself, more evidence could be expected to have been collected by the
                DRC since the Court delivered its 2005 Judgment”. The Court’s position
                is far from “taking into account” the “context” of the situation in the
                DRC which, even after 2005, remained unstable, with conflicts of varying
                intensity, and where the Government lacked total control over the entire
                territory, as underscored by numerous Security Council resolutions and
                reports by the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic
                Republic of the Congo (“MONUC”), which became the United Nations
                Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
                Congo (“MONUSCO”) on 1 July 2010.

                   15. Next, the Court’s admonition of the DRC stands in sharp contrast
                to its attitude concerning Uganda’s lack of co-­operation, as the occupy-
                ing Power, in the search for and collection of evidence in the context of
                these proceedings; this being the case even though the Court had recalled
                — as I pointed out before — that in certain circumstances, the burden of
                proof could be reversed, or at least shared between the parties, with the
                respondent’s active participation in the establishment of certain facts nec-
                essary to settle a dispute (Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in
                the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Compensation, Judgment,
                I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I), p. 26, para. 33; Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic
                of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo), Compensation, Judg-
                ment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I), p. 332, para. 15).
                   16. Indeed, the nature of the present dispute required the Respondent
                to establish certain elements of the case. Given that it was the occupying
                Power in Ituri when many of the events that needed to be established
                occurred, Uganda is undoubtedly in a better position to do so than the
                DRC, which would have had the onerous task of reconstructing evidence
                damaged by the war, the occupation of part of its territory and the
                elapsed time. However, the Respondent did not do so. It merely pointed
                to the deficiencies in the evidence provided by the DRC and noted that
                the conclusions of the Court‑appointed experts were unfounded or arbi-
                trary. This attitude of Uganda has, naturally, rendered an already ardu-
                ous task for the Court even more difficult. Surprisingly, the Judgment
                limited itself to taking note of this situation without drawing the neces-
                sary conclusions from it.
                   17. Turning to the question of compensation, the Court recalls, rightly
                in my view, in paragraph 106 of the Judgment, that it may “on an excep-
                tional basis, award compensation in the form of a global sum, within the
                range of possibilities indicated by the evidence and taking account of
                equitable considerations”. Such an approach can be justified when the
                evidence unambiguously leads to the conclusion that an internationally
                wrongful act has caused proven harm but where such evidence does not
                allow for a precise evaluation of the extent or magnitude of such harm
                (see Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of
                the Congo), Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I), p. 334
                para. 21, pp. 334‑335, para. 24, and p. 337, para. 33; Certain Activities
                Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua),
                Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I), pp. 26‑27, para. 35).

                  18. While the Judgment proceeds at length to a rigorous analysis of the
                various methods used by the Parties and by the Court‑appointed experts
                to assess the extent of damage to be compensated and to determine the
                amount of compensation owed for each head of damage, it does not,
                however, clearly set out its method of calculating the compensation to be
                granted, apart from mentioning rather vague and general considerations
                such as “[t]aking into account all the available evidence”, “the method-
                ologies proposed to assign a value to personal injuries” and “its jurispru-





6 Ord_1239.indb 357                                                                            27/06/23 08:16

                                     armed activities (decl. salam)                       190

                dence and the pronouncements of other international bodies”. It remains
                that these considerations are not sufficient and/or convincing explana-
                tions.

                   19. The majority’s position also appears to me to be questionable in
                terms of the approach followed for the allocation of the compensation
                due to the DRC. In particular, I do not agree with the decision to opt for
                “global” sums for all damage caused to persons, property or natural
                resources, without distinguishing among the different heads of damage
                within each of these three categories. For instance, with regard to damage
                to persons, the Court begins by carrying out a separate analysis of each
                damage alleged by the DRC, namely the loss of human life, injuries to
                persons, rape and sexual violence, the recruitment and deployment of
                child soldiers, and population displacements. However, having done so,
                the Court does not explain why it considers it appropriate to award a
                “single” lump sum for “all” damage to persons, instead of awarding sepa-
                rate compensation for each of the different heads of damage.


                   20. The fact that the Court refrains from fixing a specific amount of
                compensation for each of the various heads of damage seems all the more
                problematic since, recalling its 2012 case law in Ahmadou Sadio Diallo,
                the Court indicates that “any reparation is intended, as far as possible, to
                benefit all those who suffered injury resulting from internationally wrong-
                ful acts” (Judgment, para. 102). The awarded reparation should, from
                this point of view, benefit as much as possible the victims, groups of victims
                and communities who suffered harm resulting from the internationally
                wrongful acts of Uganda. Indeed, as recommended by the United Nations
                General Assembly, it is fitting to adopt, in cases of serious violations of
                international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as in
                the present case, a “victim‑oriented” approach (resolution 60/147, “Basic
                Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for
                Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and
                Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law”, 16 Decem-
                ber 2005, doc. A/RES/60/147).

                   21. It is therefore to be regretted that, by not distinguishing between
                the separate types of injuries in each of the different categories of damage,
                the Court has not helped in the appropriate distribution of the compensa-
                tion awarded to the DRC to repair the injury suffered by the victims and
                communities harmed as a result of Uganda’s internationally wrongful
                acts.
                   22. Indeed, how should the DRC distribute the US$225,000,000 among
                the families of the deceased, the injured, the rape victims, the child sol-
                diers and the displaced persons? Similarly, the US$40,000,000 granted for
                property damage leaves the DRC to resolve for itself the thorny issue of

                                     armed activities (decl. salam)                      191

                determining what share should be reserved for the restoration and recon-
                struction of public buildings, and thus paid to the State treasury, and
                what part should relate to private property. Should the Court’s exercise
                of its discretionary power in defining the amount of reparation necessar-
                ily be followed by arbitrariness in the DRC’s distribution of that amount?
                It seems to me that, on this point, the Court could have taken a more
                satisfactory approach for the sake of the victims.

                   23. Finally, it is reasonable to ask whether, in view of the rigidity and
                excessive formalism the Court has shown in its assessment of the evi-
                dence, as well as the lack of sufficient consideration it has accorded to the
                specific context of this case, which I have sought to emphasize in this
                declaration, the global sum awarded in compensation by the Court, esp­
                ecially in respect of damage to persons and property, remains far from
                reflecting the extent and gravity of the damage suffered by the DRC as a
                result of Uganda’s violations of the “principle of non‑use of force in
                international relations”, the “principle of non‑intervention”, as well as
                “massive human rights violations and grave breaches of international
                humanitarian law” (Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem-
                ocratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2005,
                p. 239, para. 207 and p. 280, para. 345, subpara. (1)). As such, to my
                great regret, the Court has deprived itself of the means that would allow
                it to ensure “reparation in an adequate form” (Factory at Chorzów, Juris-
                diction, Judgment No. 8, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 21).
