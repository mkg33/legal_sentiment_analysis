      1. I make this declaration to indicate what are, in my view, shortcomings in the Court’s
reasoning on Iran’s expropriation claim under Article IV (2) of the Treaty of Amity. The passages in
the Judgment concerning judicial expropriation in my view require greater depth of analysis.

       2. Paragraph 184 of the Judgment states as follows:

              “The Court considers that a judicial decision ordering the attachment and
       execution of property or interests in property does not per se constitute a taking or
       expropriation of that property. A specific element of illegality related to that decision is
       required to turn it into a compensable expropriation. Such an element of illegality is
       present, in certain situations, when a deprivation of property results from a denial of
       justice, or when a judicial organ applies legislative or executive measures that infringe
       international law and thereby causes a deprivation of property. Therefore, in order to
       determine whether there exists a specific element of illegality, it is necessary to examine
       the legislative, executive and judicial acts adopted by the United States as a whole.”
       (Emphasis added.)

       3. This paragraph addresses an important aspect of international economic relations, and it
states a purported rule of international law. That statement, however, is not supported by any
precedent or adequate reasons. In my opinion, the Court should be extremely cautious when making
such broad statements of law. When it does so, the Court should, at a minimum, ensure that its
statements can withstand scrutiny by backing them up with the necessary analysis and support. That
has not occurred here, notwithstanding the fact that other international tribunals have explored this
aspect of the international law of expropriation.

       4. Perhaps the reason why this paragraph stands unsupported, though, is because it is not
necessarily in keeping with prevailing understandings of expropriation in connection with decisions
by domestic courts. Paragraph 184 states that “an element of illegality is present, in certain situations,
when a deprivation of property results from a denial of justice, or when a judicial organ applies
legislative or executive measures that infringe international law and thereby causes a deprivation of
property”. This is a debatable proposition.

       5. The prevailing understanding among international tribunals is that, in order for a judicial
decision to constitute an expropriation, an element of international unlawfulness must taint the
judicial decision itself. When a court in a lawful manner simply applies legislation that is itself in
breach of a treaty obligation, or otherwise not in conformity with international law, that is not
necessarily sufficient for the judicial decision to amount to an expropriation 1. That latter scenario
seems to reflect the Court’s understanding of the facts in this case, given its specific finding that “the
rights of Iranian companies to appear before the courts in the United States, to make legal
submissions and to lodge appeals, have not been curtailed”. The Court then adds that “[t]he


       1 I note Iran’s statement in its Memorial that “the U.S. judiciary has merely acted to implement U.S. legislation and

executive orders”: Memorial of the Islamic Republic of Iran, para. 5.64.

                                                          -2-

enactment of legislative provisions removing legal defences based on separate legal personality, and
their application by the courts, do not in themselves constitute a serious failure in the administration
of justice amounting to a denial of justice” (Judgment, para. 143, emphasis added).

       6. The decisions of investor-State arbitral tribunals, the primary international tribunals to
adjudicate expropriation claims today, largely accept the requirement that the domestic judicial
decision itself must be tainted by unlawfulness. For the most part, these tribunals have distinguished
legitimate judicial determinations from abusive interferences. They have done so by requiring, in
addition to a finding that the conduct of a State’s judiciary substantially deprived an investor of its
economic rights, a further element of impropriety. Notably, these tribunals emphasized that a finding
of judicial expropriation is an exception rather than the rule. In sum, no expropriation would, as a
general rule, occur in the absence of a judicial decision amounting to a denial of justice or other
violation of international law, such as lack of due process or non-compliance with specific procedural
safeguards set out in treaties and customary international law.

        7. Recent decisions have generally confirmed this understanding. Lion Mexico
Consolidated LP v. United Mexican States, an arbitration under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (“NAFTA”), concerned a fraudulent scheme of judicial and administrative proceedings
initiated by a debtor. In its 2021 award, the tribunal reaffirmed the general rule that “liability for
expropriation under [NAFTA] Art. 1110 arising from the decisions of domestic courts requires a
finding of a denial of justice” 2.

       8. Krederi v. Ukraine is a case from which the present Judgment seems to have drawn
inspiration. In its 2018 award, the tribunal observed, in the context of private law disputes over
ownership of movable or immovable property, that “judicial determinations [of which party prevails
in a private law dispute over ownership of movable or immovable property] do not constitute
expropriation” 3. It added that where a court finds that a property transfer was invalid, “the resulting
transfers of ownership do not amount to expropriation” 4. The tribunal in Krederi then stated it is
necessary to ascertain, in order to determine whether an indirect expropriation or a measure
tantamount to expropriation had occurred in those circumstances, “whether an additional element of
procedural illegality or denial of justice was present” 5. The tribunal in Krederi dismissed the
expropriation claim on the basis that the domestic judicial proceedings had not involved a breach of
due process 6.

       9. Other international decisions have adopted similar approaches. What they have in common
is that the unlawfulness in question must attach to the judicial decision itself. Thus, in Swisslion v.
Macedonia, the tribunal concluded with respect to an expropriation claim premised on a judicial
decision that “[s]ince there was no illegality on the part of the courts, the first element of the

2021, para. 188. In support, the tribunal cited The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America,
ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003, para. 141: “Claimants’ reliance on Article 1110 adds nothing to
the claim based on Article 1105. In the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in violation of
Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen establishes a denial of justice under Article 1105.” The Loewen tribunal used the
test of “[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial
propriety” for the determination of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice (ibid., para. 132).

Claimant’s expropriation claim is not established” 7. In Manolium Processing v. Belarus, the tribunal
stated that “the standard [for an indirect expropriation claim based on a judgment of the Belarus
Supreme Court] must be equivalent to that applied to judicial decisions which violate the [fair and
equitable treatment] standard: judicial expropriation must result from denial of justice”8. The tribunal
did not find that judicial expropriation had occurred, because it had found no denial of justice 9. In
Muhammet Çap & Sehil v. Turkmenistan, although the claimants had not alleged judicial
expropriation in connection with domestic proceedings concerning the termination of contracts, the
tribunal still observed that “[t]here is a high threshold to prove judicial expropriation and that has not
been proved in this case” 10.

       10. Some tribunals have articulated a particularly high threshold in this regard. In Garanti
Koza v. Turkmenistan, the tribunal found that a seizure of property does not amount to an
expropriation unless there existed “an element of serious and fundamental impropriety about the
legal process” 11.

       11. Similarly, by way of comparison, in litigation before the European Court of Human Rights
(“ECtHR”) concerning the right to property under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention
on Human Rights and alleged interferences with that right by national judiciaries, the emphasis has
also generally been on the judicial process itself. Vulakh and others v. Russia, for example,
concerned a dispute between private parties regarding a compensation claim. The ECtHR noted that
a State’s role in a dispute under Article 1 of Protocol 1 was limited to providing a forum for the
determination of the applicants’ civil rights and obligations in the form of its judicial system. While
providing a judicial forum did not, the ECtHR stated, by itself engage the State’s responsibility under
Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, “the State may be held responsible for losses caused by such
determinations if the court decisions were not given in accordance with domestic law or if they were
flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1” 12. The
ECtHR explained that, in order to afford the protections required by Article 1 of Protocol 1, “States
are under an obligation to afford judicial procedures that offer the necessary procedural guarantees
and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly any
disputes between private persons” 13.

      12. Certain international tribunals have adopted a more lenient posture. While this is a
defensible view, it appears overall to be the less favoured position. In Saipem v. Bangladesh, the
tribunal stated that judicial expropriation does not presuppose a denial of justice (although it did
“concur[] with the parties that expropriation by the courts presupposes that the courts’ intervention

concluding for these reasons that there were no due process violations. Ibid., paras. 953-954.

was illegal”) 14. In Sistem v. Kyrgyzstan, the investor’s ownership rights in a hotel had been abrogated
by decisions of the host State’s judiciary invalidating a share purchase agreement. The tribunal did
not separately examine the lawfulness of the judicial decision. It found that the State’s abrogation of
contractual rights was tantamount to an expropriation of property, stating that “[t]he Court decision
deprived the Claimant of its property rights in the hotel just as surely as if the State had expropriated
it by decree” 15. In Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) v. Tanzania, the tribunal stated that
“judicial decisions that permit the actions or inactions of other branches of the State and which
deprive the investor of its property or property rights, can still amount to expropriation”. It added
that “[w]hile denial of justice could in some case[s] result in expropriation, it does not follow that
judicial expropriation could only occur if there is denial of justice” 16. Certain tribunals have also
upheld expropriation claims involving domestic judicial decisions where those decisions formed part
of a series of acts or omissions or of a composite act attributable to the State 17.

       13. These materials make it plain that most international decisions support a stance different
from the one adopted in this Judgment. While those views are, of course, not binding on the Court,
it requires sufficient reasons and more justification to swim against the tide of international
jurisprudence. In any case, yet especially in light of the Court’s stance on this point, it would have
done well to adopt a fuller analysis, more thoroughly reasoned and supported by authority, on the
question of judicial expropriation.
