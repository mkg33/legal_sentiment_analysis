As 1 am unable to concur in the decision reached by the Court
in its Judgment in the present case, I must set out the reasons for
my dissenting opinion and also the conclusions at which I have
arrived, but I must first say that I do so with the greatest deference
towards the opinion of the majority of the Members of the Court.

2. The question of jurisdiction must be settled—and the Parties
are in agreement on this point—in the light of Article 19 of the Trus-
teeship Agreement for the Territory of the Cameroons under
United Kingdom administration. The jurisdiction of the Court is
said to be founded on the terms of a treaty or convention “in
force”, as provided for in the concluding portion of paragraph 1
of Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.

According to that paragraph, the essential condition for estab-
lishing the jurisdiction of the Court is that the treaty in question
should have been in force at the time when the dispute arose.
The two Parties have recognized that the Trusteeship Agreement



was still in force on 30 May 1961, the date of the Republic of Came-
roon’s Application. Two days later (on 1 June 1961) the Trustee-
ship Agreement terminated, in accordance with resolution 1608
(XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations, dated 21
April of the same year.

It could be asserted that if it is the final aim of judicial action
to clear up for the future any doubts to which the text of atreaty
may give rise, or to prevent in the future the repetition of errors
of application already committed in the past, neither of these
aims could be achieved if the action were instituted on the eve
of the expiration of the treaty. But it must be borne in mind that
the aim of legal action in such a case is not always directed towards
the future, for the action may also have a retrospective aim in
seeking to obtain a judicial finding as to the conformity or non-
conformity with the law of an interpretation of a contract which
has already been given or of the application of a treaty provision
which it is considered was wrongly carried out in practice. In such
a case, it seems to me that an Application is always admissible if
the problem raised by it is concerned with the period when the
treaty was in force. Human deeds or acts involving third parties,
irrespective of who commits them—whether a man or a State—give
rise to responsibilities, which may in certain cases be determined—
in the absence of other means—of settlement by courts of justice.
And all this independently of the value of such precedents as the
judicial decision may in certain circumstances serve to establish
for the purposes of the future application of the law or agreement
in question.

3. Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement of 13 December 1946
reads as follows:

“If any dispute whatever should arise between the Administering
Authority and another Member of the United Nations relating to
the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement,
such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negotiation or other means,
shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice provided
for in Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter.”

The conditions in which, according to the text cited above, the
Court has jurisdiction, may be summed up as follows:

A. As to the juridical persons mentioned in the Agreement, the
following are considered as being entitled to appear before the
Court:

(a) the Administering Authority;

(b) any other Member of the United Nations.

The nature and scope of the intervention of such Member States
in proceedings before the Court, whether as parties to the Agree-
ment or as third parties concerned, is a subject of controversy
and interpretation, which will be considered later.


JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) 156

B. As to the subject-matter of the litigation :
(a) there must be a dispute—any dispute whatever;
(b) this dispute must relate to a question of the interpretation
or application of the provisions of the Trusteeship Agreement ;
(c) the dispute must be incapable of settlement by negotiation
or other means.

I now turn—with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court—to a
study of these two important aspects of Article 19 of the Agree-
ment in relation to the particular case raised in the Application and
taking into consideration, too, the objections of the respondent
Party.

4. The first question that arises in regard to the juridical per-
sons mentioned in Article 19, relates to the nature and scope of
intervention in Court proceedings by ‘‘another Member of the
United Nations”, as referred to in that Article. In the United
Kingdom view, these States are not parties to the Trusteeship
Agreements but merely third States who are called upon to watch
over certain rights of their nationals (Articles 9, 10, II and 13 of the
Agreement). Consequently, any “other Member” considered in-
dividually would not have the right to enter into a judicial dispute
with the Administering Authority concerning the interpretation
or application of the general provisions (Articles 3 to 8, 12, 14 to
16) of a trusteeship agreement to which it is not a party. Such a
claim would be inadmissible because supervision in regard to the
general provisions of the Agreement belongs exclusively to the
United Nations. The jurisdiction of the Court therefore does not
embrace actions of this kind by Member States. In this connection,
the United Kingdom noted that, in the case of the Cameroons, it
was not a question of the existence of a Mandate agreement under
the former system of the League of Nations, bit of a trusteeship
agreement entered into with the United Nations, these two insti--
tutions being governed by norms that are different although in-
spired by a common object. Thus it follows therefrom that the
rights of Member States as provided for in a trusteeship agree-
ment must not be equated with the rights provided for in a Man-

In the first place, this interpretation by the Respondent of the
significance of the Judgment of 21 December 1962 (case of Ethio-
pia and Liberia v. Union of South Africa) seems to me to be too
peremptory and consequently excessive. What the majority of the
Court stated in the Judgment in a very general way (I.C.J. Re-
ports 1962, p. 342) was that after the coming into force of the new
Trusteeship System ‘the necessity for judicial protection” (that is
to say, the necessity for inserting the jurisdictional clause in the
trusteeship agreements) ‘was dispensed with”; but this is very
far from meaning that such protection thenceforward became
superfluous and could not be incorporated in the new trusteeship
agreements. On the contrary, the text of the Judgment shows in
numerous passages that the judges adhered to this form of judi-
cial safeguard for the benefit of peoples under Trusteeship. The
insertion of Article IQ in the text of the Trusteeship Agreement for
the Northern Cameroons, which was done with the assent of the
United Kingdom, in itself alone shows that the interpretation
which I have just given is correct.

It is, however, necessary to make a more thorough study of this
question and I shall do so by taking into account not only the
Judgment in the South West Africa cases of 1962 but also my sepa-
rate opinion which was appended thereto (/.C.J. Reports 1962,
P. 349) in which I considered certain aspects that were not men-
tioned by the majority of the Members of the Court.

According to the Court (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 329)—

“The essential principles of the Mandates System consist chiefly
in the recognition of certain rights of the peoples of the under-
developed territories; the establishment of a regime of tutelage
for each of such peoples to be exercised by an advanced nation
as a ‘Mandatory’ ‘on behalf of the League of Nations’; and the
recognition of ‘a sacred trust of civilization’ laid upon the League
as an organized international community and upon its Member
States. This system is dedicated to the avowed object of promoting
the well-being and development of the peoples concerned and is
fortified by setting up safeguards for the protection of their rights.”

In another paragraph of its Judgment, the Court says (I.C.J.
Reports 1962, p. 336):

‘... judicial protection of the sacred trust in each Mandate
was an essential feature of the Mandates System. The essence of
this system, as conceived by its authors and embodied in Article 22
of the Covenant of the League of Nations, consisted, as stated
earlier, of two features: a Mandate conferred upon a Power as ‘a
sacred trust of civilization’ and the ‘securities for the performance
of this trust’... The administrative supervision by the League
constituted a normal security to ensure full performance by the


JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) 158

Mandatory of the ‘sacred trust’ toward the inhabitants of the
mandated territory, but the specially assigned role of the Court
was even more essenttal 1, since 1t was to serve as the final bulwark
of protection by recourse to the Court against possible abuse or
breaches of the Mandate.”

of slavery), freedom of conscience and religion, equitable treatment
by the Mandatory, and access to education, economic development
and political independence (self-determination). They were thus
recognized as having the capacity of legal persons, and this is
why in the Mandate agreements those populations are, as I believe,
parties possessed of a direct legal interest, although their limited
capacity requires that they should have a representative or guar-

dian.” (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 354.)
(b) that:

“The function assigned by the Covenant [of 1922] to the League
of Nations as a clearly characterized ‘tutelary authority’ for such
territories [under Mandate], comes particularly clearly out of the
text of paragraph 2 of Article 22, according to which the Mandatory
is required to exercise its functions ‘on behalf of the League’.

It seems to me that this point is of prime importance for the
decision in this case because, starting from the recognition of the
direct legal interest which the populations under tutelage possess
in their mandate regime and having regard to their capacity as
legal persons—for whom the League of Nations is the tutelary
authority—many legal consequences flow therefrom. In the first
place, the populations under Mandate are in fact parties to the
Mandate agreements and represented by the League of Nations.
Secondly, the Mandatory's obligation to submit to the supervision
of the tutelary authority and account for the exercise of the Mandate
is obvious. Finally, from this concept it follows that ail the Members
of the Organization are jointly and severally responsible for the
fulfilment of the ‘sacred trust’ and for watching over the populations
whose destiny has been put under their aegis.” (I.C.J. Reports 1962,


I am prepared to admit that in the articles of the Trusteeship
Agreement there can be distinguished two categories of obligations
imposed on the Administering Authority: some, which are called
individual, concern relations with other Member States or their
nationals (Articles g, 10, II and 13) while others are concerned with
the tutelary Power’s general obligations with regard to the ad-
ministration of the trust territory (for example, Articles 4, 5, 6, 8,


JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) 162

12 and 14 to 16). But even admitting this distinction, I am unable
to concur with the assertion that the competence conferred by Ar-
ticle 19 upon the Court to decide questions of the interpretation or
application of the Agreement relates only to questions concerning
individual obligations and not to questions concerning the other
obligations connected with the general administration of the Terri-
tory, supervision in respect of which comes under the allegedly
exclusive control of the United Nations. This restrictive inter-
pretation of the jurisdiction of the Court is not, in my opinion,
justified. On the contrary, it runs counter to the literal meaning
of Article 19. If the Agreement had been intended to be so limited,
the sentence in question would not have been worded as it was:
“… relating to the interpretation or application of the provisions of
this [Trusteeship] Agreement...”, but would have read: “... relating
to the interpretation or application of Articles ¢, 10, II and 13 of
this Agreement...”. There can be no doubt that, according to the
text of Article 19, as it is worded, the interpretation and application
of all the provisions of the Agreement—and not only some of them—
are matters capable of being judged by the Court. This amounts to
saying that each Member State was given the right to participate,
by means of judicial proceedings, in the task of supervising all
the obligations of the tutelary authority relating to the general
administration of the trusteeship.

8. The other pleas entered by the Respondent by way of prelimi-
nary objections must be analysed here.

(a) In the first place, the United Kingdom considers that the
chief aim of the Application is to gainsay the validity of the plebis-
cite which brought the Trusteeship to an end, all the other com-
plaints against the conduct of the Administering Authority through-
out the existence of the Trusteeship being subordinate to this
principal motive. But, according to the United Kingdom, the two
facts of the holding of the plebiscite and the declaration of the
termination of the Trusteeship do not come within the terms of the
Agreement, which does not provide for any obligation on the part
of the tutelary State in this connection, the General Assembly of
the United Nations being the only authority which dealt with these
aspects, in accordance with Article 85, paragraph 1, of the Charter,
in collaboration with the United Kingdom. Consequently, that for
which the Application is basically asking relates to a matter which
falls outside the field of application of the Trusteeship Agreement
and which exceeds the Court’s capacity to be seised of the case
under the terms of Article 19 of the Agreement.

I must say, in the first place, that an examination of the contents
and of the submissions of the Application and Memorial of the Re-
public of Cameroon does not reveal any claim regarding the annul-
ment of the plebiscite or the reconsideration of the agreement by
which the General Assembly terminated the Trusteeship in respect
of the Northern Cameroons. The reference to the nullitv of the
plebiscite that is made in the White Book was not reproduced in
the pleadings laid before the Court.


JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN, JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) 168

This fact being established, it must be noted that by its very
nature and in the literal meaning of those chapters of the Charter
which relate to the subject, the system of trusteeship is temporary
and transitory, for Article 76 (4) of the Charter, read with Articles
73 (8) and 87 (d) foresees its termination sooner or later. It goes
without saying that it would not be possible to fix beforehand in the
trusteeship agreements a date for the political emancipation of the
Territory or to determine the procedure by means of which the
extinction of the trusteeship must be achieved, for everything will
depend upon the special circumstances in each territory. It is for
this reason that the text of the Charter did not lay down general
or rigid provisions to settle in each case the time for the extinction
of the trusteeship nor the methods to be applied. But it is precisely
on that ground that a reasonable interpretation of the Charter
justifies the presumption that these details must be decided, when
the proper time comes, by the United Nations in agreement with
the Administering Authority. Even supposing, as is asserted by the
United Kingdom, that the recommendations made by the General
Assembly with respect to these points are not binding upon the
Administering Authority, being mere recommendations, that is to
say before the said Authority has expressed its views thereon, it
would nevertheless be true that as from the moment when the
said Authority accepted those recommendations and began to apply
them in its capacity as the executive organ of the Trusteeship, a
legal bond between the tutelary State and the United Nations in
the case in question is created and the new function becomes
incorporated in the framework of the Trusteeship Agreement as
a legal obligation. In the present case, resolutions 1473 (XIV) and
1608 (XV) of the General Assembly were expressly accepted and
implemented by the United Kingdom. The operations provided for
relating to the preparation and holding of the plebiscite were thus
transformed into acts of administration of the Trusteeship for which
the Administering Authority was directly responsible: hence lia-
bility would be incurred should any incorrect conduct vitiate the
results of this consultation of the people.



JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) I7I

The Application of Cameroon asks the Court to give a decision on
the question whether certain acts or attitudes of the United King-
dom, as Administering Authority, are or are not in accordance
with the law, i.e. with certain provisions in the Trusteeship Agree-
ment. The Application also asks the Court to give a decision as to
whether the United Kingdom has contravened the law by refrain-
ing from giving effect to certain precise decisions of the General
Assembly of the United Nations relating to the administration
of the Trust Territory. The grounds of law and fact on which these
requests are based were specified by the Applicant in the Applica-
tion, in accordance with the Rules of Court. This is therefore a
legal controversy falling under Chapter II of the Statute.

In my view, the character of a request for an advisory opinion
must not be attributed to this controversy about the law. The
differences are quite clear. In the majority of cases opinions are
concerned with making provision for future situations: they are
opinions sought from the Court in order to be better informed as
to how the law must be applied in the future in particular cases
which have not yet occurred. In contentious proceedings, on the
other hand, cases submitted for decision by the Court almost al-
ways relate to the past: they are aimed at obtaining a decision as
to the legal effect of acts already committed by the respondent.
It is true that, exceptionally, there are advisory opinions which
refer to past situations (see the case concerning Certain Expenses
of the United Nations, 1962); and there are also, above all in the
case-law of individual countries, circumstances in which a declara-
tory judgment can be sought in advance in order to find out whether
what one of the parties considers his rights will or will not be con-
sidered as such in a future bilateral situation. But here there is a
second difference of capital importance between an advisory opin-
ion and a judgment of the Court, namely that the former is in
no way binding upon those concerned, the opinion given having
only moral authority, while the second imposes upon the parties
a legal obligation having the force of res judicata. In the present
case, the judgment sought by the Republic of Cameroon has the
characteristics of a contentious judgment.

The argument of the United Kingdom will be recalled: admit-
ting—it states the hypothesis that a dispute exists between the
Parties, what would be the practical purpose of a mere statement
of the law regarding such dispute? What would be the effect of
the Court’s judgment with respect to the principle of res judicata
if there be no judicial decision specifying tangible obligations to
be fulfilled by the losing Party? The Written Observations of
Cameroon and Counsel for Cameroon in his oral argument re-
plied to these questions raised by the Respondent Party. So far as
I am concerned, I feel that the reasoning advanced by the Appli-
cant in this respect is satisfactory, for it is certainly true that the
points raised in the Application are susceptible of a decision entail-


JUDG. 2 XII 63 (DISS. OPIN. JUDGE BUSTAMANTE) 172

ing practical results. In declaratory suits, the pure and simple
definition of the law, in favour of one or other of the parties, con-
stitutes in itself a judgment which goes beyond the purely specu-
lative or academic field and gives the successful party a truly ob-
jective element, namely the adjudication of a right with which
what I call his “legal assets” are enriched, that is to say, the whole
sum of rights which that party pessesses in its capacity as a legal
person. If the applicant succeeds, it is precisely the fact of ensuring
to him the possession of the property or right in a final and irre-
versible manner, in virtue of the principle of res judicata, which
constitutes the practical reparation awarded to the successful
party by the declaratory judgment. If it is the respondent who
appears in the judgment as the successful party, his legal position
is consolidated and all the matters of complaint in the application
become without foundation, the effect of the judgment being a
public rehabilitation. In the case of the losing party, a certain
deterioration or diminution takes place in its personal legal situ-
ation under the influence of the res judicata, the two elements of
this diminution being the obligation to accept without the possibility
of objecting thereto the decisions contained in the judgment and,
in certain cases, the obligation to discharge the responsibilities,
which may result from the court’s statement of the law. All these
effects of a declaratory judgment become evident to the outside
world in a concrete and perceptible fashion and take their place
within the field of social or international life beyond any purely
moral or individual confines.

13. For the foregoing reasons, my opinion is that the claim is
admissible, that the preliminary objections of the United King-
dom are not well founded and that the Court has jurisdiction to
pass upon the merits of the Application of the Federal Republic
of Cameroon.
