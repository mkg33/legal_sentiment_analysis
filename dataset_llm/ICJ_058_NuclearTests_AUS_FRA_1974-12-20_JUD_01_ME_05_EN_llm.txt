Having voted against the Order of 22 June 1973 because I considered
that the questions of jurisdiction and admissibility could and should have
been resolved without postponement to a later session, ! have a fortiori
been opposed to the delays which have characterized the continuance of
the proceedings and the upshot of which is that the Court has concluded
that Australia’s Application is without object now. | must here recall the

It is not possible to take up any position vis-a-vis this Judgment with-
out being clear as to what it signifies in relation to the preliminary ques-
tions which, under the terms of the Order of 22 June 1973, were to be
considered by the Court in the present phase of the proceedings, namely
the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the dispute and the admissibility
of the Application. As the Court has had frequent occasion to state,
these are questions between which it is not easy to distinguish. The ad-

to be still in force. However, the Order is not so precise regarding the
aspects of the question of the admissibility of the Application which are
to be explored. On the contrary, it specifies none, and it is therefore by a
wholly general enquiry that the Court has to determine whether it was
validly seised of the case. One of the very first prerequisites is that the
dispute should concern a matter governed by international law. If this
were not the case, the dispute would have no object falling within the
domain of the Court’s jurisdiction, inasmuch as the Court is only com-
petent to deal with disputes in international law.

It is from that angle that I believe I should consider the question of the
admissibility of Australia’s Application. It is still my view that, as I said
in the dissenting opinion which I appended to the Order of 22 June 1973,
what is first and foremost necessary is to ask oneself whether atmospheric
tests of nuclear weapons are, generally speaking, governed by norms of


NUCLEAR TESTS (SEP. OP. PETREN) 303

international law, or whether they belong to a highly political domain
where the international norms of legality or illegality are still at the
gestation stage. It is quite true that disputes concerning the interpretation
or application of rules of international law may possess great political
importance without thereby losing their inherent character of being legal
disputes. It is nonetheless necessary to distinguish between disputes
revolving on norms of international law and tensions between States
caused by measures taken in a domain not yet governed by international
law.

In that connection, I feel it may be useful to recall what has happened
in the domain of human rights. In the relatively recent past, it was
generally considered that the treatment given by a State to its own
subjects did not come within the purview of international law. Even the
most outrageous violations of human rights committed by a State to-
wards its own nationals could not have formed the subject of an appli-
cation by another State to an international judicial organ. Any such appli-
cation would have been declared inadmissible and could not have given
rise to any consideration of the truth of the facts alleged by the applicant
State. Such would have been the situation even in relations between
States having accepted without reservation the optional clause of Article
36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice. The
mere discovery that the case concerned a matter not governed by inter-
national law would have been sufficient to prevent the Permanent Court
from adjudicating upon the claim. To use the terminology of the present
proceedings, that would have been a question concerning the admissi-
bility of the application and not the jurisdiction of the Court. It is only
an evolution subsequent to the Second World War which has made the
duty of States to respect the human rights of all, including their own
nationals, an obligation under international law towards all States mem-
bers of the international community. The Court alluded to this in its
Judgment in the case concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited (I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32). It is certainly to be
regretted that this universal recognition of human rights should not, up
to now, have been accompanied by a corresponding evolution in the
jurisdiction of international judicial organs. For want of a watertight
system of appropriate jurisdictional clauses, too many international dis-
putes involving the protection of human rights cannot be brought to
international adjudication. This the Court also recalled in the above-

We can see a similar evolution taking place today in an allied field,
that of the protection of the environment. Atmospheric nuclear tests,
envisaged as the bearers of a particularly serious risk of environmental
pollution, are a source of acute anxiety for present-day mankind, and it
is only natural that efforts should be made on the international plane to
erect legal barriers against that kind of test. In the present case, the ques-


NUCLEAR TESTS (SEP. OP. PETREN) 304

tion is whether such barriers existed at the time of the filing of the
Australian Application. That Application cannot be considered admissible
if, at the moment when it was filed, international law had not reached the
stage of applicability to the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. It
has been argued that it is sufficient for two parties to be in dispute over a
right for an application from one of them on that subject to be admissible.
Such would be the situation in the present case, but to my mind the ques-
tion of the admissibility of an application cannot be reduced to the ob-
servance of so simple a formula. It is still necessary that the right claimed
by the applicant party should belong to a domain governed by interna-
tional law. In the present case, the Application is based upon an allegation
that France’s nuclear tests in the Pacific have given rise to radio-active
fall-out on the territory of Australia. The Australian Government con-
siders that its sovereignty has thereby been infringed in a manner con-
trary to international law. As there is no treaty link between Australia
and France in the matter of nuclear tests, the Application presupposes
the existence of a rule of customary international law whereby States are
prohibited from causing, through atmospheric nuclear tests, the deposit
of radio-active fall-out on the territory of other States. It is therefore the
existence or non-existence of such a customary rule which has to be deter-
mined.

It was suggested in the course of the proceedings that the question of
the admissibility of the Application was not of an exclusively preliminary
character and that consideration of it could be deferred until the exami-
nation of the merits. This raises a question regarding the application of
Article 67 of the 1972 Rules of Court. The main motive for the revision
of the provisions of the Rules which are now to be found in that Article
was to avoid the situation in which the Court, having reserved its po-
sition with regard to a preliminary question, orders lengthy proceedings
on the substantive aspects of a case only to find at the end that the answer
to that preliminary question has rendered such proceedings superfluous.
It is true that Article 67 refers only to preliminary objections put forward

As is clear from the foregoing, the admissibility of the Application
depends, in my view, on the existence of a rule of customary international
law which prohibits States from carrying out atmospheric tests of nuclear
weapons giving rise to radio-active fall-out on the territory of other States.
Now it is common knowledge, and is admitted by the Australian Govern-
ment itself, that any nuclear explosion in the atmosphere gives rise to
radio-active fall-out over the whole of the hemisphere where it takes
place. Australia, therefore, is only one of many States on whose territory
France’s atmospheric nuclear tests, and likewise those of other States,
have given rise to the deposit of radio-active fall-out. Since the Second
World War, certain States have conducted atmospheric nuclear tests for
the purpose of enabling them to pass from the atomic to the thermo-
nuclear stage in the field of armaments. The conduct of these States
proves that their Governments have not been of the opinion that custom-
ary international law forbade atmospheric nuclear tests. What is more,
the Treaty of 1963 whereby the first three States to have acquired nuclear
weapons mutually banned themselves from carrying out further atmos-
pheric tests can be denounced. By the provision in that sense the signa-
tories of the Treaty showed that they were still of the opinion that
customary international law did not prohibit atmospheric nuclear tests.

To ascertain whether a customary rule to that effect might have come
into being, it would appear more important to learn what attitude is
taken up by States which have not yet carried out the tests necessary for
reaching the nuclear stage. For such States the prohibition of atmospheric
nuclear tests could signify the division of the international community
into two groups: States possessing nuclear weapons and States not pos-
sessing them. If a State which does not possess nuclear arms refrains
from carrying out the atmospheric tests which would enable it to acquire
them and if that abstention is motivated not by political or economic
considerations but by a conviction that such tests are prohibited by


NUCLEAR TESTS (SEP. OP. PETREN) 306

customary international law, the attitude of that State would constitute
an element in the formation of such a custom. But where can one find
proof that a sufficient number of States, economically and technically
capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons, refrain from carrying out
atmospheric nuclear tests because they consider that customary inter-
national law forbids them to do so? The example recently given by
China when it exploded a very powerful bomb in the atmosphere is suffi-
cient to demolish the contention that there exists at present a rule of
customary international law prohibiting atmospheric nuclear tests. It
would be unrealistic to close one’s eyes to the attitude, in that respect,
of the State with the largest population in the world.

To complete this brief outline, one may ask what has been the attitude
of the numerous States on whose territory radio-active fall-out from the
atmospheric tests of the nuclear Powers has been deposited and continues
to be desposited. Have they, generally speaking, protested to these Powers,
pointing out that their tests were in breach of customary international
law? I do not observe that such has been the case. The resolutions passed
in the General Assembly of the United Nations cannot be regarded as
equivalent to legal protests made by one State to another and concerning
concrete instances. They indicate the existence of a strong current of
opinion in favour of proscribing atmospheric nuclear tests. That is a
political task of the highest urgency, but it is one which remains to be
accomplished. Thus the claim submitted to the Court by Australia
belongs to the political domain and is situated outside the framework of
international law as it exists today.

I consider, consequently, that the Application of Australia was, from
the very institution of proceedings, devoid of any object on which the
Court could give a decision, whereas the Judgment finds only that such
an object is lacking now. I concur with the Judgment so far as the out-
come to be given the proceedings is concerned, i.e., that the Court is not
called upon to give a decision, but that does not enable me to associate
myself with the grounds on which the Judgment is based. The fact that I

The method whereby the judgments of the Court are traditionally
drafted implies that a judge can vote for a judgment if he is in agreement
with the essential content of the operative part, and that he can do so
even if he does not accept the grounds advanced, a fact which he normally
makes known by a separate opinion. It is true that this method of order-
ing the matter is open to criticism, more particularly because it does not
rule out the adoption of judgments whose reasoning is not accepted by
the majority of the judges voting in favour of them, but such is the prac-

I have still to explain my position with regard to the question of the
Court’s jurisdiction, in the sense given to that term by the Order of 22
June 1973. As the Judgment expressly states, this many-faceted question
is not examined therein. That being so, and as I personally do not feel
any need to examine it in order to conclude in favour of the disposition
of the case for which 1 have voted, I think that there is no place in this
separate opinion for any account of the ideas | have formed on the sub-
ject. A separate opinion, as I conceive it, ought not to broach any ques-
tions not dealt with by the judgment, unless it is absolutely necessary
to do so in order to explain the author’s vote. I have therefore resisted the
temptation to engage in an exchange of views on jurisdiction with those
of my colleagues who have gone into this question in their dissenting
opinions. A debate between judges on matters not dealt with in the
judgment is not likely to add up to anything more than a series of unrelated
monologues—or choruses. For whatever purpose it may serve, however,
I must stress that my silence on the subject does not signify consent to
the proposition that the Court had jurisdiction.
