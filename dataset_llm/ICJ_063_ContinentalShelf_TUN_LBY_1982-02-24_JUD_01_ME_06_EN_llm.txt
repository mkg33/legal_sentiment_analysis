2. The Court’s jurisdiction in this case derives from the Special Agree-
ment (Compromis) of 10 June 1977. (See Statute, Art. 36, para. 1.) The
main provisions regarding the Court’s jurisdiction are contained in
Article 1 of the Special Agreement.

There are certain minor discrepancies between the Parties in the trans-
lations from the original Arabic. These discrepancies to some extent
reflected the divergence of views between them as to the competence
entrusted to the Court by the Special Agreement. But as appears from the
Judgment, these discrepancies have not been of significance as to the
Court’s interpretation of its competence. I share this view.

likewise share the view that in the present case, the task of the Court as
defined in Article 1 of the Special Agreement of 10 June 1977 differs from
that entrusted to the International Court of Justice in the North Sea
Continental Shelf cases by Special Agreement of 2 February 1967 and that
entrusted to the Court of Arbitration in the Delimitation of the Conti-
nental Shelf case by the Arbitration Agreement of 10 July 1975, between
France and the United Kingdom.

Under Article 1 of the present Special Agreement the International
Court of Justice is “requested to render its judgment” with regard to what
principles and rules of international law may be applied for the delimita-
tion of the respective continental shelf areas of the Parties. The starting
point is of course that it is for the Court to decide what are the “principles



and rules of international law” applicable to the present case according to
Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, taking into consider-
ation the provisions of the Special Agreement concluded between the
Parties. In laying down the principles and rules of international law ap-
plicable to the delimitation of the areas concerned the Court is requested
“to take its decision according to” :

(a) equitable principles ;

(b) the relevant circumstances which characterize the area ;

(c) the new accepted trends in the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea
(Art. 1, para. 1).

I share the view of the Court that these provisions may have a bearing on
the sources of law available to the Court in the present case ; and likewise
the observation by the Court that the reference to these factors in Article 1
may affect the legal relations of the Parties in the present case only, but
cannot affect the position in law of other States.

However, I beg to differ somewhat with the Court with regard to what
specific elements may be relevant in this connection ; the relative weight to
be given to these elements and the relative weight and importance thereof
measuring the one vis-a-vis the other. I shall revert to these questions.

Paragraph 2 of Article 1 has likewise considerable bearing on the task
entrusted to the Court. It provides that “Also the Court is further
requested” :

(a) to clarify the practical method for the application of the above-men-
tioned principles and rules ;

{b) to do so in relation to the specific situation ;

(c) to do so, so as to enable the experts of the two countries to delimit these
areas without any difficulties.

I share the view of the Court that clearly the Court’s task is to render a
binding and final

“judgment in a contentious case in accordance with Articles 59 and 60
of the Statute and Article 94, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, a
judgment which will have therefore the effect and the force attributed
to it under Article 94 of the Charter of the United Nations and the
said provisions of the Statute and the Rules of Court” (Judgment,
para. 29).

Of course the Court has not been asked to render an advisory opinion, as it
could not be asked to do so, in the present contentious case between two
States. Nor could it agree in any other way solely to give “guidance” to the
Parties to the present dispute which would lack the essential elements of a
formal judgment (UN Charter, Art. 96).

I share the view that the Court in its Judgment should lay down the



practical method for the application of the principles and rules of inter-
national law with the degree of precision applied by the Court in the
operative part thereof. I further share the view that in concluding a
treaty according to Articles 2 and 3 of the Special Agreement for the pur-
pose of implementing the Judgment the negotiations of the Parties will
be of a limited and technical nature providing in treaty form for the
concrete line of delimitation drawn up by the experts of the two Parties.
This must be done in compliance with the practical method for the appli-
cation of the principles and rules of international law laid down in the
Judgment.

3. Inow revert to the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Special
Agreement wherein the Court is called upon in rendering its decision based
on principles and rules of international law to take account of :

(a) equitable principles ;

(b) the relevant circumstances which characterize the area ; and

(c) the recent trends admitted by the Third Conference on the Law of the
Sea.

Obviously this enumeration does not convey authority to the Court to
decide ex aequo et bono under Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
Court.

enlarges or restricts the sources of international law available to the Court
in this case.

4. Re (a) : The reference to equitable principles follows from already
established concepts of the applicable sources of international law. It is of
importance that the Parties are in agreement on this point. However, they
seem to disagree what these equitable principles are, and the concrete legal
consequences to be drawn from this reference.

The express reference to equitable principles in the Agreement may to
some extent have been inspired by the provisions contained in the Third
Conference on the Law of the Sea : draft convention (Informal Text),
document A/CONF.62/WP.10/Rev.3 of 27 August 1980. This draft text
had identical provisions in Article 74 for Exclusive Economic Zones and
Article 83 for the continental shelf with regard to delimitation of these
zones between States with opposite or adjacent coasts. Paragraph 1 pro-
vided :

“The delimitation of the continental shelf [the exclusive economic
zone] between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected
by agreement in conformity with international law. Such an agree-
ment shall be in accordance with equitable principles, employing the
median or equidistance line, where appropriate, and taking account of
all circumstances prevailing in the area concerned.”

These formulations were amended during last year’s session of the



Conference. The draft convention on the Law of the Sea of 28 August 1981
(doc. A/CONF.62/L.78), Articles 74 and 83, now provides :

“The delimitation of the continental shelf [the exclusive economic
zone] between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected
by agreement on the basis of international law as referred to in
Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice in order
to achieve an equitable solution.”

This new text was suggested as a compromise in order to satisfy two
group factions in the Conference. It may have some merits in fulfilling this
aim since it makes no reference either to the equidistance principle or to the
equity principle. The new twist is the general reference to Article 38 of the
Statute and the provisions to the effect that the delimitation must result in
“an equitable solution”. It has not been discussed in detail in the Con-
ference.

5. Re(b) : The express reference in Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Special
Agreement to the relevant circumstances which characterize the area is of
course

“in complete harmony with the jurisprudence of the Court, as appears
from its Judgment in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, in which it
held that international law required delimitation to be effected ‘in
accordance with equitable principles and taking account of all the
relevant circumstances’ ” (Judgment, para. 23).

It seems obvious that in drawing up lines of delimitation between the
respective continental shelves (and 200-mile economic zones), of neigh-
bouring countries, the relevant circumstances in the region concerned must
play an important role.

But the express reference to “the relevant circumstances which charac-
terize the area” in Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Special Agreement is not
without significance. The Parties to the litigation have expressly agreed as
to the relevancy of this element. This demonstrates the importance which
the Parties attach to these regional circumstances, which again must give
an added impetus to the Court to give them due consideration. The con-
cern of the Parties in this respect is evident also from the repeated reference
thereto in Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Special Agreement in connection
with the request to the Court to clarify the practical method for the appli-
cation of the international law principles “in this specific situation”.

It seems futile to attempt to give an exhaustive analysis of all the relevant
circumstances which characterize the area. It must obviously include the
directions of the coasts concerned ; whether they are straight or curved or
otherwise regular or irregular ; whether they are in opposite directions in
the sense that prolongations of the shelves and exclusive economic zones
seaward would lead to collisions between competing claims for such
shelves or zones ; the presence of sinuosities, bays, islands, drying shoals or
rocks, etc. The water depths of the areas concerned could play a role. The



geographical features of the coasts and marine extensions thereof, includ-
ing bathymetry, geomorphology, etc., all these elements are by their nature
relevant circumstances that characterize the area. The above-mentioned
formulations are not confined to geographic aspects. Both Parties have
relied heavily on the geology of the area, not only of the upper layers
thereof but in great detail, deeper lying strata almost down and back to the
creation.

As to the forebears of these provisions in the Special Agreement, men-
tion may be made of the references to special circumstances which were
included in Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Geneva Convention on the
Continental Shelf of 29 April 1958, although here the principle was closely
connected with the equidistance/median line principle. In the operative
paragraph (para. 101) of the Judgment of the Court in the North Sea
Continental Shelf cases of 1969, the Court held that delimitation of the
continental shelves concerned “is to be effected by agreement in accor-
dance with equitable principles, and taking account of all the relevant
circumstances . . .” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 53) (emphasis added). Among
the factors to be taken into account were, according to that Judgment, inter
alia, the general configuration of the coasts of the Parties as well as the
presence of any special or unusual feature.

As hereinbefore mentioned, Articles 83 and 74 of the draft convention
on the Law of the Sea dated 29 August 1981 (doc. A/CONF.62/L.78)
contain a broad reference to Article 38 of the Statute of the Court, but no
longer any express reference to “all circumstances prevailing in the area
concerned”. But the purpose was not to weaken the importance of the
circumstances prevailing in the area for the concrete delimitation.

paragraph 1, of the Special Agreement is “the new accepted trends in the
Third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference”.

The draft convention has not yet been adopted as the final text by the
Law of the Sea Conference. It is by virtue of the Special Agreement that the
Court is authorized to take into account trends which — although having
reached an advanced stage of the process of elaboration, even a stage where
such trends to a considerable extent have been included in the practice of
States — have not yet attained the force of general international law.
Certain of the recent trends in the draft convention may have acquired
such status. Owing to the express provisions in Article 1, paragraph 1, of
the Special Agreement, it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the
present case to make a distinction between accepted trends and recent
developments of law due to the activities of the Third Law of the Sea
Conference and the ensuing practice of States.

The reference in the Special Agreement to new accepted trends in the
Third Law of the Sea Conference may obviously create certain difficulties
with regard to its meaning and application to the present case. What



proposals in the draft convention should be considered as “trends” ? Are
such trends “accepted” in the sense of the Special Agreement ; and what
importance should be attached to such trends ? The question of the relative
importance of different trends may also arise. As an example, mention may
be made of the interrelationship between the provisions of Part V of the
draft convention concerning Exclusive Economic Zones and Part VI con-
cerning the Continental Shelf, both with regard to conceptual approaches
and to basic substantive issues.

A number of the provisions of the four Geneva Conventions on the Law
of the Sea of 29 April 1958 expressing the more traditional rules of the
International Law of the Sea have been included in the draft convention of
1981. But even in these chapters of the draft convention new trends have
frequently been included. Thus, Article 3 of the draft convention provides
as to the breadth of the territorial sea that a coastal State has the right to
establish a territorial sea “up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles”.
This corresponds to the limit of the territorial sea claimed by the two
Parties.

The added importance which the draft convention seems to give to
islands — and even rocks— may be a trend of interest to the present case. In
this connection, mention may be made of Article 121, paragraph 2, of the
draft convention which provides :

“The territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic
zone, and the continental shelf of an island are determined in accor-
dance with the provisions of this Convention applicable to other land
territory.”

This entails that islands have an exclusive economic zone and a conti-
nental shelf proper. The same trend is noticeable even with regard to mere
rocks. Article 121, paragraph 3, provides that only “Rocks which cannot
sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no
exclusive zone or continental shelf”.

Similar trends are apparent from the provisions concerning archipelagic
States and archipelagic waters ; see, inter alia, the draft convention of 1981,
Part IV and Article 2.

opinion not be underestimated or disregarded in the present case especially
with regard to the importance of two main island formations, the island of
Jerba and the Kerkennah archipelago, as well as their adjacent low-tide
elevations.

7. Of great bearing are also other “new accepted trends” especially
Part V, Exclusive Economic Zone, inter alia, Articles 55-62 and Ar-
ticles 73-74. Likewise, Part VI, Continental Shelf, inter alia, Articles 76,77,
80, 81 and 83.



The principle of Exclusive Economic Zones of 200 nautical miles is an
innovation in international law. These Exclusive Economic Zones “shall
not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the
breadth of the territorial sea is measured” (Art. 57). The purposes of the
Exclusive Economic Zones are threefold. They are :

(a) a continental shelf zone ;

(b) an exclusive fisheries zone with some interesting modern trends with
regard to sovereign rights and conservation rights and obligations
(Arts. 61 ff.) ;

(c) an exclusive economic exploration and exploitation zone also with
regard to other natural resources such as the production of energy
“from water, currents and winds” (Art. 56).

This triple zone approach has been defined in Article 56 as follows :

“(1) In the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State has :

(a) sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, con-
serving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-
living, of the sea-bed and subsoil and the superjacent waters, and
with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and
exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the
water, currents and winds ; ...”

The coastal State exercises these rights in its 200-mile zone whether the
sea-bed thereof is shallow or deep, even if the depths thereof exceed the
2,500-metre isobath mentioned in Article 76, paragraph 5 ; and regardless
of whether the sea-bed or subsoil within the 200-mile zone can be con-
sidered a natural prolongation or not (see Art. 76, paras. 1, 4 (a) and 5). Of
course, a full 200-mile economic zone is only possible where the expanses
of the ocean concerned so permit. This is obviously not the case here where
the coasts of Tunisia and Libya are angled in such a manner as to lead to a
collision between their respective 200-mile economic zones including their
sea-bed and subsoil (continental shelf areas), should they be extended
maximally. It also follows from the provisions of Article 76 that inside the
200-mile distance from the coasts, the natural prolongation principle is not
the overriding principle with regard to the sea-bed and subsoil of the
economic zone.

In this context it should be noted that the economic zone principle up to
200 miles is as valid and important a principle as the continental shelf
principle. The two principles are laid down in two separate parts ; Part V
for the Exclusive Economic Zone, and Part VI for the Continental Shelf. In
Part VI on the continental shelf, special consideration and privileged status
is given to the 200-mile zone concept both with regard to the extent of the



continental shelf (see Art. 76 of the draft convention), and to payments
and contributions (see Art. 82 of the draft convention).

In seems clear that the provisions of both Part V and Part VI contain
“new accepted trends” as provided for in Article 1 of the Special Agree-
ment. This includes also the provisions specifically dealing with the de-
limitation of those marine areas between States with opposite and adja-
cent coasts in Article 74 (Exclusive Economic Zones) and Article 83
(Continental Shelf). See also Article 76, paragraph 10.

wide recognition in the practice of States. The latest development in this
respect in the Mediterranean is the Moroccan Law (Dahir), No. 1-81 of
8 April 1981. It establishes a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone along the
coasts of Morocco. The zone according to Article 1, paragraph 2 :

“extends up to a distance of 200 nautical miles calculated from the
straight baselines or the normal baselines from which the territorial
sea is measured”.

Article 11 concerning the delimitation of the 200-mile zone provides for
the application of the equidistance principle as follows :

“Without prejudice to the circumstances of a geographical or geo-
morphological order, and taking account of all pertinent factors, the
delimitation shall be made in conformity with equitable principles
prevailing under international law, by means of bilateral agreements.
The outer limits of the exclusive economic zone shall not extend
beyond the median line all the points of which are equidistant from
the nearest points of the baselines of the Moroccan coasts and the
coasts of foreign countries whether these coasts are situated opposite
to or adjacent to the coasts of Morocco.” (See Official Bulletin of
Morocco — No. 3575 (6.5.81), pp. 232-233.)

But as early as 20 August 1971, that is to say before the emergence of the
concept of economic zones, Tunisia concluded an agreement with Italy
regarding the delimitation of the continental shelf between the two coun-
tries. The agreement was based on the principle of equidistance measured
from the nearest points on the baselines for territorial seas and “taking into
account islands, islets, and low-tide elevations” (Art. 1), special arrange-
ments being made for the Italian islands of Pantelleria, Lampione, Lam-
pedusa and Linosa (Art. 2) (Judgment, para. 20).

8. The concept of the continental shelf has also been subjected to new
trends in Part VI, inter alia, in the proposed Article 76, trends which, to
some extent at least, depart from the earlier established concepts, for



example as they are defined in Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention
on the Law of the Sea of 29 April 1958.

Article 76 of the draft convention on the Law of the Sea operates in
paragraph 1 with two types of continental shelf. The first type is that part
of the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond the
State’s territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land
territory to the outer edge of the continental margin. The other type is the
sea-bed and subsoil of a State up

“to a distance of 200-nautical miles from the baselines from which the
breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the
continental margin does not extend up to that distance”.

It follows from this latter definition that it is not a criterion for claiming a
continental shelf up to 200 miles that this part of the shelf constitutes a
natural prolongation of the land territory. The 200-mile continental shelf
can extend beyond the natural prolongation and into the rise and deep
ocean floor (abyssal plain) of the relevant ocean. Actually, this second
criterion of Article 76 is a corollary to the provisions laid down in
Articles 55-57 on the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.

Paragraph 3 of Article 76 has an additional definition of the continental
margin relating to the first criterion mentioned above. It provides :

“The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of
the landmass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and
subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep
ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.”

Paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 have interesting provisions concerning the extent
of a continental margin that exceeds 200 miles. These provisions are of
interest in the present case. Thus, paragraph 4 (a) (i) demonstrates that the
upper layers of the sediment may be of importance for the extent (beyond
200 miles) of the continental margin, in so far as the extent of the conti-
nental margin may be established by reference to the points where “the
thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1 per cent of the shortest distance
from such point to the foot of the continental slope”. Article 76, para-
graph 4 (a) (ii), and paragraph 5, demonstrate that adjacency and proxi-
mity are likewise relevant considerations as shown by the distance or depth
criteria there laid down.

9. The conclusions to be drawn from the new trends arrived at in
Parts V and VI of the draft convention may be stated as follows :

The emergence of the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone concept in



Part V of the draft convention is not based on the concept of natural
prolongation, but on the concept that a coastal State should have fune-
tional sovereign rights over the natural resources in a belt of water and
sea-bed 200 miles seawards whether the coastal State concerned possesses
a continental shelf in the traditional sense or not. This new development
has been accepted in recent State practice. This 200-mile economic zone
concept refers not only to the resources of the seas (living or non-living),
but also to the natural resources on or in the sea-bed. To this extent it is also
in practice a continental shelf concept.

Note should likewise be taken of the fact that the provisions concerning
the delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zones in Article 74 of the draft
convention and the provisions on the delimitation of continental shelves
between States with opposite or adjacent coasts, contained in Article 83,
are identical.

Certain questions appear to arise because of the inter-relation between
the new concept of exclusive economic zones and the continental shelf
concept, the more so since certain new trends in Article 76 of the draft
convention seem to strengthen this inter-relation and interdependence.

The first question which may be raised is whether the concept of natural
prolongation has not been weakened by these recent trends within the
200-mile zone. Even without these developments, the question still arises
as to whether the natural prolongation concept may appreciably assist in
drawing up the dividing line between the continental shelves of adjacent
States in cases like the present where the Parties share a common conti-
nental shelf which is the joint natural prolongation of the landmass of both
Parties. Another question which appears to arise is whether different lines
of delimitation are conceivable for the Exclusive Economic Zone and the
continental shelf in such a case, bearing in mind that the exclusive eco-
nomic zone concept laid down in Part V of the draft convention also
comprises the natural mineral resources of the sea-bed and its subsoil, that
is the natural resources of the continental shelf. A question about this
underlying problem was put to the Parties during the oral pleadings by one
Member of the Court. The answers seemed somewhat inconclusive. With
all due respect, it seems to me as though sufficient attention has not been
given in the Judgment to this aspect of delimitation based on the new
accepted trends ; neither in the legal reasoning — including the equity
considerations — nor in the operative part thereof.

shelf” refers to “an institution of international law which, while it remains
linked to a physical fact, is not to be identified with the phenomenon
designated by the same term — ‘continental shelf’ — in other disciplines”. It
is a concept of international law. And this concept may obviously be
moulded and changed by developments and changes in international law.



The development of the exclusive economic zone concept is not an insig-
nificant element in this respect and might perhaps influence the practical
method of delimitation.

In this context, note should be taken of a development in the Law of the

the practical impact of the concept of natural prolongation through the
development of that of the 200-mile economic zone ; this aside from the
practical difficulties of basing a line of delimitation for a joint shelf on the
natural prolongation thereof when the two adjacent countries also share
the same landmass.

The Parties have only briefly touched upon the 200-mile exclusive eco-
nomic zone concept as a new accepted trend in the Law of the Sea Con-
ference. This new concept might not fit well into some of the main sub-
missions and legal reasoning of the Parties. Even so, the question arises as
to whether the Court in its Judgment should not have laid more emphasis
on this recent trend. I feel that it is hardly conceivable in the present case to
draw a different line of delimitation for the exclusive economic zone and
for the continental shelf. The areas to be delimited will in both instances be

the breadth of the territorial sea is measured”. To my mind, it is somewhat
doubtful that a practical method for the delimitation of the areas con-
cerned should be based solely or mainly on continental shelf considera-
tions. Thus, it may perhaps be a too restrictive approach in the present case
to maintain that “the ‘principles and rules of international law which may
be applied’ for the delimitation of continental shelf areas must be derived
from the concept of the continental shelf itself” (Judgment, para. 36).

11. I share the view expressed in paragraph 61 of the Judgment that

“despite the confident assertions of the geologists on both sides that a
given area is ‘an evident prolongation’ or ‘the real prolongation’ of the
one or the other State for legal purposes it is not possible to define the
areas of continental shelf appertaining to Tunisia and to Libya by
reference solely or mainly to geological considerations. The function
of the Court is to make use of geology only so far as required for the
application of international law.”

Libya discerns a purely northward direction of the prolongation of the
landmass — “the northward thrust” — based mainly on geology (Judgment,
para. 62). In the written and oral pleadings of Libya, a variety of arguments
have been put forward to support the allegations concerning the northward
thrust ; neither taken separately nor considered together do these argu-
ments support the northward thrust theory which seems untenable in law
as well as on the facts.

Tunisia sees “an eastward natural prolongation off eastern Tunisia”



(Judgment, para. 64), based on a more complex set of factors including,
inter alia, geology, bathymetry and geomorphology. The geography,
bathymetry and geomorphology demonstrate interesting features with
regard to an eastward trend of the shelf.

These features alone disprove the allegations of a northward thrust.
Even so, I share the view of the Court to the effect that :

“The Court, while not accepting that the relative size and impor-
tance of these features can be reduced to such insubstantial propor-
tions as counsel for Libya suggest, is unable to find that any of them
involve such a marked disruption or discontinuance of the sea-bed as
to constitute an indisputable indication of the limits of two separate
continental shelves, or two separate natural prolongations.”
(Para. 66.)

As a consequence of the eastward natural prolongation, as seen by it,
Tunisia has submitted a sheaf of lines constituting a method of alternatives
as the equitable method of delimitation of the continental shelf. However, I
share the view of the Court that none of these lines is tenable as the
equitable line of delimitation. The geometric constructions seem some-
what too artificial to be considered equitable. At the same time they may
have implications for lines of delimitation with third States that may be
unacceptable.

I shall, however, deal briefly with one interesting line of argument
advanced by Tunisia in this context, based on the physiographic definition
of the continental margin laid down in Article 76, paragraph 3, of the draft
convention. This paragraph provides :

“The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of
the landmass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and the
subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep
ocean floor...”

Based on this definition of the “continental margin” Tunisia submits
that the Pelagian Block corresponds to “the sea-bed and subsoil of the
shelf” while the “Misratah-Malta Escarpment or Ionian Flexure” corres-

Plain corresponds to “the deep ocean floor” mentioned in the definition.
Accordingly it should be possible to define the orientation of, and draw the
dividing line for, the continental shelf between the two Parties by a tine
drawn from a point at the Tunisian-Libyan coast to the centre of the Ionian
Abyssal Plain. In my opinion Article 76, paragraph 3, should be consid-
ered a “new accepted trend in the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea”
according to Article 1 of the Special Agreement. But I share the view that
the argument advanced by Tunisia may not be tenable, and would hardly
lead to an equitable result, all circumstances taken into consideration. The
main purpose of Article 76, paragraph 3, is to serve as a yardstick for the



outer limit of a State’s continental shelf into the oceans. More concrete
rules for this seaward delimitation are given in the subsequent paragraphs
of Article 76 ; in particular, paragraphs 4-7. The definition given in Arti-
cle 76, paragraph 3, may have a bearing on the delimitation of the conti-
nental shelves of neighbouring countries. This is obvious with regard to
“opposite” States. It is not so obvious that the definition of paragraph 3

of adjacent States. The present case has features of delimitation related
both to those of opposite and to those of lateral States. However, the
special features of the areas of the Mediterranean here concerned do not
lend themselves easily to a practical application of Article 76, paragraph 3,
for delimitation purposes, at least not where the delimitation in question is
concerned. Nor is it apparent that it would result in an equitable solution.
In this context one must also bear in mind the provisions laid down in
Article 76, paragraph 10, to the effect that :

“The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the question
of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite
or adjacent coasts,”

which seems relevant in this context.

12. Article 1 of the Special Agreement of 1 December 1978 provides
that the Court : “shall take its decision according to equitable principles,
and the relevant circumstances which characterize the area...”

It appears from these provisions that there is a close relation between the
“equitable principles” and the “relevant circumstances which characterize
the area”.

Aside from these express references to equitable principles in the Special
Agreement, it is indisputable that equity forms part of international law.
But as a legal principle it cannot operate in a vacuum either juridically — it
is part of the international law system — or factually — as a legal principle it
applies to a concrete case. In the present case, it must be clearly distin-
guished from an “ex aequo et bono” decision. The equitable solution in this
case based on equitable principles must have its foundation in interna-
tional law not in a discretionary decision-making process. Or, as Maitland
stated in his famous dictum quoted in oral argument, “Equity came not to
destroy the law but to fulfil it”. This dictum is as valid within the inter-
national law system as in the common law systems.

In the Judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the
River Meuse case of 28 June 1937, Judge Hudson stated how equitable
principles form an integral part of international law, as follows :



“What are widely known as principles of equity have long been
considered to constitute a part of international law, and as such they
have often been applied by international tribunals .. . A sharp divi-
sion between law and equity, such as prevails in the administration of
justice in some States, should find no place in international jurispru-
dence ; even in some national legal systems, there has been a strong
tendency towards the fusion of law and equity. Some international
tribunals are expressly directed by the compromis which control them
to apply ‘Law and Equity’. . . Of such a provision, a special tribunal of
the Permanent Court of Arbitration said in 1922 that ‘the majority of
international lawyers seem to agree that these words are to be under-
stood to mean general principles of justice as distinguished from any
particular systems of jurisprudence’. . .” (P.C.1.J., Series A/ B, No. 70,
p. 76.)

Equity as part of international law was dealt with in some detail in the
North Sea Continental Shelf cases (I. C.J. Reports 1969, paras. 88-89). It has
been extensively dealt with by the Parties in their written pleadings and
oral argument.

By the very nature of things the line between a decision based on
equitable principles — lying within the realm of international law accord-
ing to Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Statute — and a decision ex aequo et
bono according to Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Statute is a very delicate
distinction. This distinction should not be blurred. Thus, in my respectful
opinion, equity principles cannot operate in a void. In this context, it is
interesting to note that in the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf case
between France and the United Kingdom the Court of Arbitration in its
Decision of 30 June 1977 was careful not to operate in a void so as to leave
it to a totally discretionary decision-making process where to draw the
dividing line. The equidistance principle was applied as a juridical starting
point for the application of equity. In this context, it states, inter alia :

“The Court notes that in a large proportion of the delimitations
known to it, where a particular geographical feature has influenced
the course of a continental shelf boundary, the method of delimitation
adopted has been some modification or variant of the equidistance
principle rather than its total rejection. In the present instance, the

graphical feature in circumstances in which the line equidistant from
the coasts of the two States would otherwise constitute the appro-
priate boundary. Consequently, it seems to the Court to be in accord
not only with the legal rules governing the continental shelf but also
with State practice to seek the solution in a method modifying or
varying the equidistance method rather than to have recourse to a wholly



different criterion of delimitation.” (See HMSO, Cmnd. 7438, 1978,
para. 249.) (Emphasis added.)

Thus, in this arbitration as well as in the North Sea Continental Shelf
cases, the Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice,
respectively, used at least as one point of departure the equidistance
principle for the application of equity. Furthermore, in the North Sea
Continental Shelf cases the principle prevailed that the Parties should
divide the continental shelf between them by agreement although subse-
quent to and pursuant to the Court’s decision.

In the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the Court held, as is well
known, that the use of the equidistance method of delimitation was not
obligatory between the Parties. Actually no single method of delimitation
could be considered obligatory in all circumstances.

equidistance principle. Thus, in paragraph 99 of its Judgment, the Court
indicated solutions where the claims to a continental shelf overlap as
follows :

“In a sea with the particular configuration of the North Sea, and in
view of the particular geographical situation of the Parties’ coastlines
upon that sea, the methods chosen by them for the purpose of fixing
the delimitation of their respective areas may happen in certain
localities to lead to an overlapping of the areas appertaining to them.
The Court considers that such a situation must be accepted as a given
fact and resolved either by an agreed, or failing that by an equal
division of the overlapping areas, or by agreements for joint exploi-
tation, the latter solution appearing particularly appropriate when it
is a question of preserving the unity of a deposit.” (I. C.J. Reports 1969,
p. 52, para. 99.)

The importance which the International Court of Justice attached to the
equidistance principle in applying equitable principles has been summed
up as follows by the Court of Arbitration in the Delimitation of the
Continental Shelf case in the following manner :

“As to the Court’s [the I.C.J°s] observations on the role of the
equidistance principle, it was far from discounting the value of the

obligatory under customary law. ‘It has never been doubted’, the
Court commented, ‘that the equidistance method is a very convenient
one, the use of which is indicated in a considerable number of cases’
(I.CJ. Reports 1969, para. 22) ; and again it commented ‘it would
probably be true to say that no other method of delimitation has the
same combination of practical convenience and certainty of applica-



tion’ (ibid, para. 23). The truth of these observations is certainly
borne out by State practice, which shows that up to date a large
proportion of the delimitations of the continental shelf have been
effected by the application either of the equidistance method or, not
infrequently, of some variant of that method.” (See HMSO, Cmnd.
7438, 1978, p. 54, para. 85.)

13. In its Judgment in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the Court
made certain distinctions between opposite States and adjacent States.
With regard to opposite States, the Court remarked :

“The continental shelf area off, and dividing, opposite States, can
be claimed by each of them to be a natural prolongation of its terri-
tory. These prolongations meet and overlap, and can therefore only be
delimited by means of a median line ; and, ignoring the presence of
islets, rocks and minor coastal projections, the disproportionally dis-
torting effect of which can be eliminated by other means, such a line
must effect an equal division of the particular area involved.” (Z.C.J.
Reports 1969, p. 36, para. 57.)

Where the delimitation of the continental shelf of adjacent States was
concerned, the Court made the following observations :

“This type of case is therefore different from that of laterally
adjacent States on the same coast with no immediately opposite coast
in front of it, and does not give rise to the same kind of problem...”


The line of reasoning for the distinction between lateral and opposite
delimitation is interesting, especially the express assumption that in lateral
delimitation “adjacent States on the same coast [have] no immediately
opposite coast in front of [them]”. In the present case, however, one of the
main difficulties arises from the fact that although Tunisia and Libya are
adjacent States, their relevant coasts have to a substantial extent the
characteristics of opposite States as well as those of lateral States. This
main characteristic must be reflected in the practical method of delimita-
tion. If not, the relevant circumstances which characterize the area have
not been taken into account, and the solutions arrived at may be discre-
tionary rather than equitable.

14. The question arises as to whether it would be possible to elucidate
certain of the equitable principles or considerations which may play a role
in the present case, taking into consideration, inter alia, “the relevant
circumstances which characterize the area, as well as the new accepted
trends in the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea”.


To give an exhaustive enumeration of such principles or elements ap-
plicable in the present case would be impossible and unwarranted. Unwar-
ranted because it would be contrary to the very nature of the concept of
equitable principles to attempt exhaustive formulations or enumerations
and impossible for much the same reasons. The Court stated in the North
Sea Continental Shelf cases to this effect :

“In fact, there is no legal limit to the considerations which States
may take account of for the purpose of making sure that they apply
equitable procedures, and more often than not it is the balancing-up
of all such considerations that will produce this result rather than
reliance on one to the exclusion of all others. The problem of the
relative weight to be accorded to different considerations naturally
varies with the circumstances of the case.” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 50,
para. 93.)

But for this very reason, I respectfully submit that the equity consider-
ations to be applied must be placed in some legal context. If applied in a
legal void as entirely self-sufficient, equity may easily change the character
of a decision from being a legal decision under Article 38, paragraph 1, of
the Statute to becoming an ex aequo et bono decision governed by the
provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Statute. The Court has no
such authority in the present case.

corollary to equity considerations is the equidistance principle mentioned
above. I share the view of the Court that the equidistance principle is not a
mandatory principle for delimiting the continental shelf (or Exclusive
Economic Zones) of neighbouring States (Judgment, para. 109). But I re-
spectfully hold an opinion different from that expressed by the Court in
paragraph 110.

It is of course correct that, in the present case, the Court is not required
“as a first step, to examine the effects of a delimitation by application of
the equidistance method, and to reject that method in favour of some other
only if it considers the results of an equidistance line to be inequitable”.
But in this context, it should be borne in mind that in the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 29 April 1958, on the continental shelf, Article 6 provides,
inter alia :

“In the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is
justified by special circumstances, the boundary is the median line,
every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is
measured.”

I would likewise draw attention to Article 12 of the first Geneva Con-
vention of 29 April 1958 on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.
Article 12 provides :



“Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each
other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between
them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median
dividing line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest
points on the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial seas of
each of the States is measured.”

I further respectfully submit that in stating in paragraph 110 of the
Judgment that “equidistance is not, in the view of the Court . . . a method
having some privileged status in relation to other methods” the Court also
seems unaware of the fact that even in the draft convention of 1981, of the
Third Law of the Sea Conference, the text has given special consideration

the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts is in
terms identical to those of the Geneva Convention. Article 15 provides as
follows :

“Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each
other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between
them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median
line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the
two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however,
where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special cir-
cumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way
which is at variance therewith.”

In its almost total disregard or belittlement of the equidistance method
in paragraph 110 of the Judgment the Court now clearly is at variance with
the succinct statement made by the Court in its Judgment of 20 February
1969, paragraph 22, to the effect that :

“Particular attention is directed to the use, in the foregoing for-
mulations, of the terms ‘mandatory’ and ‘obligation’. It has never
been doubted that the equidistance method of delimitation is a very
convenient one, the use of which is indicated in a considerable number
of cases. It constitutes a method capable of being employed in almost
all circumstances, however singular the results might sometimes be,
and has the virtue that if necessary, — if for instance, the Parties are
unable to enter into negotiations, — any cartographer can de facto
trace such a boundary on the appropriate maps and charts, and those
traced by competent cartographers will for all practical purposes
agree.” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 23.)

The Court likewise seems to disregard the fact that the equidistance/
median line principle is the only concrete principle added to the broad
reference to equity which has been discussed in the Third Law of the Sea
Conference as related to the delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zones
and the Continental Shelf of adjacent and opposite States. This is apparent


from the various Informal Negotiating Texts and the Informal Text of the
draft convention on the Law of the Sea of 27 August 1980, Articles 74 and
83.

The Court likewise seems to disregard the findings of the Court of
Arbitration in its Decision of 30 June 1977 as quoted in paragraph 12 of
this dissenting opinion. The Court completely disregards the very abun-
dant State practice laid down in numerous delimitation agreements and
enactments demonstrating the practical importance of the equidistance
principle for the delimitation of continental shelves and the exclusive
economic zones.

In my opinion the arguments advanced in paragraph 110 fail to mention
any legal principles on which a decision on delimitation should be based.
The “relevant circumstances” to be evaluated must be applied in relation
to some rules of law. However, in the present case, the Court seems to
consider that delimitation based on “relevant circumstances” as a purely
discretionary operation where the Court more or less at will can disregard
relevant geographical factors like the island of Jerba, the Zarzis promon-
tories and the Kerkennah Islands ; can draw lines of delimitation which
run closely in front of such geographical factors and veer lines in an
arbitrary manner without any attempt to establish reasonable equality as
to distance between the nearly opposite coasts concerned. In my respectful
submission, both the reasoning in paragraph 110 and elsewhere in the
Judgment as well as the operative paragraphs thereof seem closer to a
decision-making process based on an ex aequo et bono approach according
to Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court than to the authority
given to the Court in Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Statute. The results,
‘however, are not equitable in my respectful opinion.

15. Another element to be taken into consideration is the development
of the 200-mile zone concept ; both as it has been developed in the draft
convention — Chapter VI on the Continental Shelf, Article 76, para-
graph 1, and in Chapter V, Article 54, on the Exclusive Economic Zone.
Admittedly this case is concerned with the delimitation of the continental
shelf of the two Parties. But the 200-mile concept as developed both in
Chapter V and in Chapter VI of the draft convention must, in my re-
spectful opinion, be considered at least as “new accepted trends” in the

the application” of the principles and rules of international law, consid-
eration should be given to this development, and for various reasons. When
neighbouring States claim functional sovereign rights up to 200 miles — be
they opposite States or adjacent States — their claims are based on a
distance criterion. This very fact seems to strengthen the equidistance/
median line principle as an equitable approach for delimiting overlapping
areas. Furthermore, the Court should not exclude that Exclusive Economic
Zones may be established in the areas concerned as in other areas of the
Mediterranean. It seems reasonable that the dividing line for such zones
should coincide with those laid down for continental shelf purposes. Also
for this reason, I believe that the line of delimitation should be based on



somewhat different considerations than those chosen by the Court. The
resulting practical method of delimitation would have been more adequate
and equitable considering the special circumstances and needs of the
region. In paragraph 109 of the Judgment, the Court states, after having
noted that equidistance “has been employed in a number of cases” in the
practice of States that : “equidistance may be applied if it leads to an
equitable solution ; if not, other methods should be employed”. But the
Court has not attempted to use this test in the present case. Nor has it
examined whether the equidistance principle could be fruitfully used,
adjusted by principles of equity and the relevant circumstances charac-
terizing the region concerned to bring about an equitable solution. In this
context, I wish to refer to paragraph 126 of the Judgment, where the
observation is made that :

“The major change in direction undergone by the coast of Tunisia
seems to the Court to go some way, though not the whole way, towards
transforming the relationship of Libya and Tunisia from that of
adjacent States to that of opposite States”

and the Court continues :

tance line becomes a factor to be given more weight in the balancing of
equitable considerations than would otherwise be the case”.

Aside from paying homage to the equidistance principle by this last sen-
tence, the Court seems to have disregarded it completely also with regard
to these “opposite” coasts. The island of Jerba, an island of some 690
square kilometres, has been totally disregarded, as have the promontories
of Zarzis. The archipelago of Kerkennah has, for reasons not spelled out by
the Court, been given “half weight”, but not in regard to establishing an
equidistance line but a 52° line which deviates fundamentally from an
equidistance line.

1 also beg respectfully to disagree with the assessment of the Court in the
above-quoted passage in paragraph 109, that “equidistance may be
applied if it leads to an equitable solution ; if not, other methods should be
employed”. This relegation of the equidistance principle to the last rank of
practical methods does not correspond — in my opinion — to prevailing
principles of international law as evidenced by State practice, multilateral
and bilateral conventions ; the findings of the Court in its 1969 decisions
and the findings by the Court of Arbitration in 1977 in the Delimitation of
the Continental Shelf case.



16. An equitable principle which has been considered as important both
in the Judgment of the International Court of Justice in the 1969 Judgment
in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases as well as in the Court of Arbi-
tration’s Decision in the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf case in 1977
is the principle of not refashioning nature.

The International Court of Justice in its 1969 Judgment had this to say
about the principle :

“Equity does not necessarily imply equality. There can never be any
question of completely refashioning nature, and equity does not
require that a State without access to the sea should be allotted an area
of continental shelf, any more than there could be a question of
rendering the situation of a State with an extensive coastline similar to
that of a State with a restricted coastline. Equality is to be reckoned
within the same plane, and it is not such natural inequalities as
these that equity could remedy.” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 49-50,
para. 91.)

stated : ‘

“It is therefore not a question of totally refashioning geography
whatever the facts of the situation but, given a geographical situation
of quasi-equality as between a number of States, of abating the effects
of an incidental special feature from which an unjustifiable differ-
ence of treatment could result.” (Ibid, p. 50, para. 91.) (Emphasis
added.)

In its 1977 Decision in the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf case,
the Court of Arbitration dealt with this principle in regard to Ushant and
the Scilly Isles. The Court stated, inter alia :

“Both Ushant and the Scilly Isles are, moreover, islands of a certain
size and populated ; and, in the view of the Court, they both constitute
natural geographical facts of the Atlantic region which cannot be
disregarded in delimiting the continental shelf boundary without
‘refashioning geography’.

Just as it is not the function of equity in the delimitation of the
continental shelf completely to refashion geography, so it is also not
the function of equity to create a situation of complete equity where nature
and geography have established an inequity. Equity does not, therefore,
call for coasts, the relation of which to the continental shelf is not
equal, to be treated as having completely equal effects.” (See HMSO,
Cmnd. 7438, 1978, p. 116, paras. 248 and 249.) (Emphasis added.)

This principle is of course closely bound up with the principle that “the



relevant circumstances which characterize the area” must be taken into
consideration. It is obvious that in a case of drawing the lines of delimi-
tation between States — be it on land or in marine areas — the relevant
circumstances characterizing the region concerned must play a decisive
role. This follows from the very nature of things. In addition it has
expressly been laid down in the Special Agreement in Article 1, para-
graph 1, and reverted to in Article 1, paragraph 2, that the concrete ele-
ments of, inter alia, nature and geography shall be taken into account. This
certainly does not mean that they should be disregarded wholly or in part.
If, irrespective of these facts such relevant regional circumstances should
be held irrelevant and consequently disregarded, very solid reasons of
equity and justice must exist therefore. In paragraph 79 of the Judgment,
the Court states :

constituent part of the Tunisian littoral’, referred to in the Tunisian
submissions, is a feature closely related to the claim of Tunisia to
historic rights...”

But islands, islets and low-tide elevations have of course more far-reaching
effects for the delimitation of the continental shelves than those mentioned
in the above quotation. This follows from principles of law as well as from
considerations of equity.

Thus, in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf of
1958, it is provided that the definition of the term “continental shelf” is
used also as referring “to the sea-bed and subsoil of similar submarine
areas adjacent to the coasts of islands”. As mentioned above, Article 121 of
the draft convention on the Law of the Sea of 1981, provides that islands
have their territorial sea, their Exclusive Economic Zone and their conti-
nental shelf proper “in accordance with the provisions of this Convention
applicable to other land territory”.

17. The Court affirms in paragraph 79 of the Judgment that the pre-

which clearly calls for consideration ; and further that “the Court cannot
accept the exclusion in principle of the island of Jerba and the Kerkennah
Islands from consideration”. But in the next sentence, the Court holds that
the island of Jerba is to be totally disregarded ; as to the relevancy of the
Kerkennah Islands, it is stated that “the existence and position of the
Kerkennah Islands . . ., on the other hand, is highly material”. However, in
paragraph 129 of the Judgment, the Court has deemed it appropriate to
attribute only half-effect to the Kerkennah Islands. The enormous low-tide
elevations surrounding both the Kerkennah Islands and Jerba are disre-
garded so completely that no mention of them has been made at all.

Neither has any mention been made of the important promontories of
Zarzis, of which the island of Jerba is but a continuation ; nor of the fact
that the coastline from Ras Ajdir to the Bay of Al-Biban, which has a
direction west-northwest, veers almost due north when meeting the coast-



line of the Zarzis Peninsula and its continuation, the island of Jerba. This
complete change of direction has been disregarded in the Judgment.

Disregarding completely these special characteristics of very relevant
sections of the Tunisian coastline and only giving half effect to the Ker-
kennah Archipelago is in my respectful opinion a refashioning of nature
which is neither warranted in law nor by the facts, nor is the disregard of
such important geographical features equitable.

Some further details may be illustrative. The island of Jerba is actually a
continuation of the mainland in a northerly direction ; at low-tide it is

strait (ford). Already in Roman times the island was linked to the mainland
with a causeway which is still in use by camel drivers. The waters sur-
rounding the rest of Jerba are also very shallow. Jerba is, like the Ker-
kennahs, surrounded by a belt of banks and low-tide elevations where
stationary surface fishing-gear is in extensive use (Tunisian Memorial,
paras. 3.25-3.27). The island has an area of some 690 square kilometres,
which corresponds to twice the size of the island of Malta. The economic
importance of the island is significant. It has a considerable perma-
nent population and has likewise developed into an important tourist
centre.

18. The Kerkennah Archipelago forms a natural prolongation of the
north shore of the Gulf of Gabes. The Kerkennah Archipelago consists of
two main islands and a number of smaller islands (Tunisian Memorial,
paras. 3.18-3.20). The area of the Kerkennahs is some 180 square kilo-
metres, i.e., almost the size of the island of Malta. The Kerkennahs are
surrounded by an extensive belt of low-tide elevations and shoals some
9-27 kilometres in width. The Kerkennahs lie 11 miles to the east of the
mainland but are virtually a continuation of the mainland by virtue of the
extreme shallowness of the waters separating them from the mainland.
Navigation in the passage between the islands and the mainland is difficult
and only possible for small craft. On the seaward side of the Archipelago
there is likewise a large surrounding area of low-tide elevations. These
areas are closely linked to the islands and are exploited by the local
population, as has been the case throughout history, by a special form of
aquaculture bearing striking similarities to agriculture. The countless per-
manent surface fishing installations are tended and harvested by the fish-
ermen (owners) on foot. This immense rampart of low-tide elevations is
marked by buoys and beacons (Tunisian Memorial, para. 3.21). Both the
islands of the Kerkennah Archipelago as well as the low-tide elevations
and the unique shallowness of the waters form very striking and relevant
circumstances, which certainly characterize the area. Such characteristics
have been given significant weight in the annals of international law, in
State practice, in the findings of the International Court of Justice in the
