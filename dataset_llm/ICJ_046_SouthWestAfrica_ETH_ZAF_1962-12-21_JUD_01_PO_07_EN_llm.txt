Since we find ourselves unable to concur in the decision of the
Court, it is necessary that we should state the reasons for our
dissent.

The case is one of special importance. It involves not only a
fundamental question of judicial approach; it is as well one which
presents quite exceptional difficulties—a fact reflected by the
narrow majority on which the decision rests.

These difficulties are not merely technical, though these exist.
They spring rather from the fact that the case belongs to a type
the outcome of which is liable to be dominated, or at least strongly
influenced, by the character of the initial approach to it.

In order to assume jurisdiction, the Court had not only to reject
all the objections formally presented by the Respondent but also
certain others. These we shall mention in due course.

The Court has, in our opinion, only been able do this by adopting
premises which, as will emerge from what we have to say, largely
- assume beforehand the correctness of the conclusions arrived at.

The general approach adopted by the majority of the Court
in the present case can, we think, reasonably, be described as
follows—namely that it is desirable and right that a provision
for the compulsory adjudication of certain disputes, which figures
(or did figure) as part of an institution—the Mandate for South
West Africa—which is still in existence as an institution, should
not be held to have become inoperative merely on account of a
change of circumstances—provided that this change has not
affected the physical possibility of continued performance. The
present Court exists, and is of the same general character and
carries out the same kind of functions as the tribunal (the former
Permanent Court) which originally had jurisdiction under this
provision (i.e. Article 7 of the Mandate for South West Africa).
Since there still exist States (and amongst them the Applicant
States) who would have been entitled to invoke Article 7 before
the changed circumstances came about, this Article must now be
interpreted as still giving them this right, notwithstanding anything

We have felt unable to adopt this approach. In our opinion, the
only correct method of procedure is to begin by an examination
of the legal elements, with especial reference, where questions of
interpretation are concerned, to the actual language employed,
and then, on the basis of this examination, to consider what are
the correct conclusions which, as a matter of law, should be drawn
from them. It is in this spirit that we have approached our task.

We are not unmindful of, nor are we insensible to, the various
considerations of a non-juridical character, social, humanitarian
and other, which underlie this case; but these are matters for the
political rather than for the legal arena. They cannot be allowed to
deflect us from our duty of reaching a conclusion strictly on the basis
of what we believe to be the correct legal view. They do however
lead us to draw attention to another aspect of the matter.

A Court called upon to consider objections to its jurisdiction
must exclude from consideration all questions relating to the
merits of the dispute, unless the jurisdictional issues are so inter-
twined with the merits that they cannot be considered separately,
and must be joined to the merits. It is nevertheless legitimate
for a Court, in considering the jurisdictional aspects of any case,
to take into account a factor which is fundamental to the jurisdic-
tion of any tribunal, namely whether the issues arising on the merits
are such as to be capable of objective legal determination.

It is apparent from the Memorials in the present case, that what
the Court will principally be asked to decide on the merits is whether,
in a number of different respects, the Respondent State, as Manda-
tory, is in breach of its obligation under Article 2 of the Mandate to
“promote to its utmost the material and moral well-being and the
social progress of the inhabitants of the territory...”. There is
hardly a word in this sentence which has not now become loaded
with a variety of overtones and associations. There is hardly a
term which would not require prior objective definition, or re-
definition, before it could justifiably be applied to the determination
of a concrete legal issue. There is hardly a term which could not be
applied in widely different ways to the same situation or set of facts,
according to differing subjective views as to what it meant, or



ought to mean in the context; and it is a foregone conclusion that,
in the absence of objective criteria, a large element of subjectivity
must enter into any attempt to apply these terms to the facts of
a given case. They involve questions of appreciation rather than
of objective determination. As at present advised we have serious
misgivings as to the legal basis on which the necessary objective
criteria can be founded.

The proper forum for the appreciation and application of a
provision of this kind is unquestionably a technical or political
one, such as (formerly) the Permanent Mandates Commission, or
the Council of the League of Nations—or today (as regards Trustee-
ships), the Trusteeship Council and the Assembly of the United
Nations. But the fact that, in present circumstances, such technical
or political control cannot in practice be exercised in respect of the
Mandate for South-West Africa, is not a ground for asking a Court
of law to discharge a task which, in the final analysis, hardly appears
to be a judicial one.

The above considerations, in our opinion, strongly reinforce
the view which, on other grounds, we have taken as to the third
preliminary objection, namely that disputes about the conduct of
the Mandate in relation to the ‘sacred trust” (as opposed to dis-
putes about the individual statal interests of the Members of the
League under the terms of the Mandate) are not the kind of disputes
to which the compulsory adjudication clause of the Mandate was
intended to, or did, apply.

We now turn to the substance of the case in its present phase,
which involves the question of the competence of the Court to
proceed to the merits; and by way of introduction we would say
that our conclusions in this phase have been reached against the
background of four major principles of law which we believe to
be fundamental to any determination of the issues involved.
They are:

1. The principle of consent as the essential condition for
founding international jurisdiction. Such consent may be given
generally, in advance, or ad hoc, and may in a proper case be
held to have been given. But that it was in fact given, and that
it covers the actual case before the Court, must be objectively
demonstrated, and cannot simply be presumed.

2. The principle that rights conferred on or vested in persons
or entities in a specified capacity, or as members of a specified



class, are not conferred on or vested in them in their personal
or individual capacity, and therefore cease to be available to
them if they lose the specified capactiy, or cease to be members
of the indicated class; and are equally not available to them in a
different capacity, or as members of another class.

3. The principle that provisions are prima facie to be inter-
preted and applied according to their terms, where these are
clear and unambiguous in their expression of the intention of
the parties, and that such terms can only be ignored or overridden
(if at all) on the basis of some demonstrably applicable legal
principle of superior authority. The principle of interpreta-
tion directed to giving provisions their maximum effect cannot
legitimately be employed in order to introduce what would
amount to a revision of those provisions.

4. The principle that a Court of law cannot correct the past
errors or omissions of the parties, and that it is not the province
of a Court to place some of the parties in the same position as they
would have been in if they had taken action they could have
taken, but did not take, and even deliberately avoided taking.

In our opinion, the judgment of the Court fails to give expression
to these principles, either ignoring them or advancing no adequate
grounds for departing from them—as in our view it clearly does.
In the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition there is a well-known saying
that “hard cases make bad law”, which might be paraphrased
to the effect that the end however good in itself does not justify the
means, where the means, considered as legal means, are of such
a character as to be inadmissible.

It is because of the foregoing considerations, and as Members of
a Court whose task it is under Article 38, paragraph 1, of its Statute,
“to decide in accordance with international law’’, that we are
unable to accept the reasoning on which the Judgment of Court is
based.


The jurisdiction of the Court is fundamentally derived from
Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, which en-



ables the Court to hear any cases referred to it by the parties
[ie. jointly] or any cases “specially provided for ... in treaties or
conventions in force”. But whether in any particular case that
jurisdiction can be exercised compulsorily depends on factors lying
outside this provision—for instance the existence of a Declaration
under paragraph 2 of Article 36 (the “Optional Clause”) or the terms
of a provision for compulsory adjudication by the Court contained
in some treaty or convention in force. It is for this reason that the
Applicant States have invoked the jurisdiction of the Court on the
basis of the combined effect of Article 7 of the Mandate for South
West Africa and of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court. The reason
for citing the latter provision, which is really mechanistic in
character, is that the original forum for the settlement of disputes
arising under Article 7 of the Mandate was the predecessor of the
present Court, the former Permanent Court of International Justice,
which ceased to exist in 1946. This latter Court was equally the
forum specified in the adjudication clauses of many other inter-
national instruments. In our view, the effect of Article 37 of the
Statute of the present Court—and its sole relevant effect in the
context of this case—was (as between the parties to the Statute)
to substitute the present Court for the former Permanent Court in
all cases in which under a “treaty or convention in force”, the Per-
manent Court would have had jurisdiction and would have been
competent to hear and determine the case. Its relevant portions
read as follows:

“Whenever a treaty or convention in force provides for reference
of a matter to ... the Permanent Court of International Justice, the
matter shall, as between the parties to the present Statute, be
referred to the International Court of Justice.”

We draw attention to the similarity of wording between this
provision and Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute, in so far as
each relates to treaties and conventions in force. This has a sig-
nificance we shall mention later.

It is, however, clear that, whatever may be the correct inter-
pretation to be given to the phrase ‘‘a treaty or convention in force”,
Article 37 can, on the face of it, only apply to adjudication clauses
contained in instruments which are in law treaties or conventions,
and which also are as such, i.e. as treaties or conventions, “in
force”. Only in the case of clauses figuring in instruments fulfilling
these conditions is the present Court substituted for the former
Permanent Court.

The first contention of the Respondent State is that the relevant
instrument—the Mandate for South West Africa—does not fulfil
either of these conditions, that it neither has the character of a
treaty or convention nor, if it has, is it any longer in force.

Before considering the character of the Mandate, which will
involve stating, as briefly as we can, the salient features of the pro-
cess by which it was brought into being, there are some preliminary
points of law that must be referred to.

We do not adopt a narrow or doctrinaire view as to what is com-
prised by the term “treaty or convention”. We are not—or at least
so we hope—guilty of the solecisms either of supposing that treaties
or conventions are only what are actually labelled as such, or of



confusing an international agreement as an act, with the particular
instrument in which it is embodied. We give the widest connotation
to the notion of treaty or convention as covering everything: that
constitutes or embodies an international agreement, whatever its
form, style or nomenclature—any agreement, formal or informal.

But while international law takes, and rightly takes, a liberal
view of what constitutes a treaty, convention or other form of
international agreement, the notion is not an unlimited one. It is
not synonymous, as the Judgment of the Court might almost lead
one to suppose, with international acts and instruments generally.
Thus, in its final draft on the “Conclusion, Entry into Force and
Registration of Treaties” completed earlier this year (Document
A/CN. 4/148 of 3 July 1962), the International Law Commission
of the United Nations adopted the following definition of a treaty,
with which we associate ourselves:

“ ‘Treaty’ means any international agreement in written form,
whether embodied in a single instrument or in-two or more related
instruments and whatever its particular designation [here follows a
list of some dozen possible appellations including of course ‘con-
vention’, ‘agreement’ and ‘declaration’], concluded between two or
more States or other subjects of international law and governed
by international law.”

It will be seen that this concept of what constitutes a treaty,
though wide, is not a limitless one. We draw attention in particular,
in the context, to the phrases “in written form” and “concluded
between two or more States or other subjects of international
law”!. Thus a verbal agreement, while it might be held binding
(see the Ihlen Declaration in the Eastern Greenland case, P.C.1.J.

1 À subsidiary point, which we accordingly place in a footnote, is that if, contrary
to our view, the Mandate for South West Africa would otherwise have been in the
nature of a treaty or convention, an objection to this conclusion could be based
on the character of the parties to the Mandate agreement (if it was one). As we
shall demonstrate later, the only entity other than the Mandatory itself which
could have ranked as a party would have been the League of Nations or the Council
of the League acting for it. But it is by no means certain that in 1920 (when the
Mandate was formulated) international legal opinion would have accepted the
conclusion arrived at by the present Court in the Injuries to United Nations Servants
case (Reports 1949, p. 174) that international organizations could have a legal
personality separate and distinct from that of their Members, and rank as entities
“subjects of international law’’. If not, then, considered in the light of contempo-
raneous legal thinking, the Mandate could only have ranked as a treaty or conven-
tion if the parties to it were States. Our view is that the only State which could have
been a party to the Mandate, if it was a treaty or convention, was the Mandatory,
and this would mean (on the above premises) that the Mandate was not a treaty
or convention at all, because not concluded between ‘‘two or more States”. We
deal with this further later.

made under paragraph 2 of Article 36 of the Statute are sometimes
said to possess, would arise solely from the multiplicity of these
declarations and their interlocking character, which gives them
a bilateral or multilateral aspect. A single such declaration, if it
stood quite alone, could not be an international agreement. Op-
tional clause declarations are clearly not covered by the words
“treaties or conventions” in paragraph 1 of Article 36, or there
would have been no need for paragraph 2, except perhaps for reasons
of convenience or emphasis. If a State making a declaration of willing-

obligations. But that does not of itself make it a treaty, convention
or other form of international agreement. It cannot be too strongly
emphasized that the test is not, or is not merely, the creation
of international obligations, but the character of the act or instrument
that gives those obligations their legal force. This is the essential point
which, in relation to the Mandate for South West Africa, has to be
investigated in this part of the case.

stand by the Mandate is not this piece of paper, but the international
act that gave rise to it, namely, in our view, the Resolution of the
Council of the League of the same date. What has to be investigated
is the nature of this Resolution and “vhether it had a treaty or
conventional character.

The initial steps (we shall not go into a lot of back history)
leading to the issuing or promulgation of the Mandate for South
West Africa were as follows:

I. The various Mandatories for the ex-German territories in
Africa and the Pacific were nominated by the five Principal Allied
and Associated Powers of the First World War, the United States
of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan (hereafter

the Council of the League and promulgated by a Council resolution
of December 17, 1920, had undergone certain alterations as a result
of being referred to the Secretariat and to “other legal experts”
at the stage when it consisted of a draft containing the proposals
of the Principal Powers. These alterations, to which we shall come
presently, were accepted by the Council for the purposes of its
final resolution. They do not affect the substance of the Mandate,
but they do affect in certain highly significant respects the jurisdic-

Whereas, by the aforementioned Article 22, paragraph 8, it is
provided that the degree of authority, control or administration to
oe exercised by the Mandatory not having been previously agreed
upon by the Members of the League, shall be explicitly defined by
the Council of the League of Nations:

Confirming the said Mandate, defines its terms as follows: —

ARTICLE I

In the normal course it would be sufficient to rest upon the
answer we gave to the first objection. Since however we believe
that each of the objections raised by the Respondent stands in
the way of the Court assuming jurisdiction, we deem it our duty,
in the special circumstances of the case, to express our views on
each objection.

There are also special reasons why we should deal with the
Second Objection.

(a) The actual language of the Article

We shall assume as our starting point something which we shall
demonstrate more fully later, namely that, in the absence of ex-
press provision to the contrary, rights conferred on or exercise-
able by a person or entity in a specified capacity, or as a member of
a specified class, cannot be exercized in another capacity, or as
a member of another class, or continue to be exercized if the speci-
fied capacity is lost or membership of the class ceases.

seems to have been considered no longer so the moment after. Yet
the basic principles of the Trusteeship System were the same as
those of the Mandates System.

This consideration of itself reveals, we think, the artificiality of the
claim that Article 7 was a fundamental necessity for the working
of the Mandate System.


Finally, it is obvious that any undertaking to continue with the
obligations of Article 7 in relation to “ex-Members”, or “former
Members”, of the League, would have needed precise definition.
Just what States were to be regarded as coming within these cate-
gories (original Members, Members at the date of dissolution,
countries at any time Members, Members also Members of the United
Nations, etc.)? The moment the League was dissolved, there would
