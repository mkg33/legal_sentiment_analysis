   26. The Court is aware of the complex and tragic situation which has
long prevailed in the Great Lakes region. There has been much suffering
by the local population and destabilization of much of the region. In par-
ticular, the instability in the DRC has had negative security implications
for Uganda and some other neighbouring States. Indeed, the Summit
meeting of the Heads of State in Victoria Falls (held on 7 and 8 August
1998) and the Agreement for a Ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo signed in Lusaka on 10 July 1999 (hereinafter “the Lusaka
Agreement”) acknowledged as legitimate the security needs of the DRC’s
neighbours. The Court is aware, too, that the factional conflicts within
the DRC require a comprehensive settlement to the problems of the
region.
   However, the task of the Court must be to respond, on the basis of
international law, to the particular legal dispute brought before it. As it
interprets and applies the law, it will be mindful of context, but its task
cannot go beyond that.

dent Kabila broke off his alliances with Rwanda and Uganda and estab-
lished new alliances with Chad, the Sudan and various anti-Ugandan
insurgent groups.
   With regard to the official statement by President Kabila published on
28 July 1998 calling for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from Congo-
lese territory, Uganda interprets this statement as not affecting Uganda,
arguing that it made no mention of the Ugandan armed forces that were
then in the DRC pursuant to President Kabila’s earlier invitation and to
the Protocol of 27 April 1998.
   38. Uganda affirms that it had no involvement in or foreknowledge of
the FAC rebellion that occurred in eastern Congo on 2 August 1998 nor
of the attempted coup d’état against President Kabila on the night of
2-3 August 1998. Uganda likewise denies that it participated in the attack
on the Kitona military base. According to Uganda, on 4 August 1998
there were no Ugandan troops present in either Goma or Kitona, or on
board the planes referred to by the DRC.
   39. Uganda further claims that it did not send additional troops into
the DRC during August 1998. Uganda states, however, that by August-
September 1998, as the DRC and the Sudan prepared to attack Ugandan
forces in eastern Congo, its security situation had become untenable.
Uganda submits that “[i]n response to this grave threat, and in the lawful
exercise of its sovereign right of self-defence”, it made a decision on




11 September 1998 to augment its forces in eastern Congo and to gain
control of the strategic airfields and river ports in northern and eastern
Congo in order to stop the combined forces of the Congolese and Suda-
nese armies as well as the anti-Ugandan insurgent groups from reaching
Uganda’s borders. According to Uganda, the military operations to take
control of these key positions began on 20 September 1998. Uganda
states that by February 1999 Ugandan forces succeeded in occupying all
the key airfields and river ports that served as gateways to eastern Congo
and the Ugandan border. Uganda maintains that on 3 July 1999 its
forces gained control of the airport at Gbadolite and drove all Sudanese
forces out of the DRC.
   40. Uganda notes that on 10 July 1999 the on-going regional peace
process led to the signing of a peace agreement in Lusaka by the Heads of
State of Uganda, the DRC, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia,
followed by the Kampala (8 April 2000) and Harare (6 December 2000)
Disengagement Plans. Uganda points out that, although no immediate or
unilateral withdrawal was called for, it began withdrawing five battalions
from the DRC on 22 June 2000. On 20 February 2001 Uganda announced
that it would withdraw two more battalions from the DRC. On 6 Sep-
tember 2002 Uganda and the DRC concluded a peace agreement in
Luanda (Agreement between the Governments of the Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo and the Republic of Uganda on Withdrawal of Ugandan
Troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Co-operation and
Normalisation of Relations between the two Countries, hereinafter “the
Luanda Agreement”). Under its terms Uganda agreed to withdraw
from the DRC all Ugandan troops, except for those expressly authorized
by the DRC to remain on the slopes of Mt. Ruwenzori. Uganda claims
that, in fulfilment of its obligations under the Luanda Agreement, it com-
pleted the withdrawal of all of its troops from the DRC in June 2003.
Uganda asserts that “[s]ince that time, not a single Ugandan soldier has
been deployed inside the Congo”.

  41. As for the support for irregular forces operating in the DRC,
Uganda states that it has never denied providing political and military
assistance to the MLC and the RCD. However, Uganda asserts that it
did not participate in the formation of the MLC and the RCD.
        “[I]t was only after the rebellion had broken out and after the
      RCD had been created that Uganda began to interact with the RCD,
      and, even then, Uganda’s relationship with the RCD was strictly
      political until after the middle of September 1998.” (Emphasis in the
      original.)
According to Uganda, its military support for the MLC and for the RCD
began in January 1999 and March 1999 respectively. Moreover, Uganda
argues that the nature and extent of its military support for the Congo-
lese rebels was consistent with and limited to the requirements of self-
defence. Uganda further states that it refrained from providing the rebels




with the kind or amount of support they would have required to achieve
such far-reaching purposes as the conquest of territory or the overthrow
of the Congolese Government.

                           ISSUE OF CONSENT

   42. The Court now turns to the various issues connected with the first
submission of the DRC.
   43. In response to the DRC’s allegations of military and paramilitary
activities amounting to aggression, Uganda states that from May 1997
(when President Laurent-Désiré Kabila assumed power in Kinshasa)
until 11 September 1998 (the date on which Uganda states that it decided
to respond on the basis of self-defence) it was present in the DRC with
the latter’s consent. It asserts that the DRC’s consent to the presence of
Ugandan forces was renewed in July 1999 by virtue of the terms of the
Lusaka Agreement and extended thereafter. Uganda defends its military
actions in the intervening period of 11 September 1998 to 10 July 1999 as
lawful self-defence. The Court will examine each of Uganda’s arguments
in turn.

   44. In a written answer to the question put to it by Judge Vereshchetin
(see paragraph 22 above), the DRC clarified that its claims relate to
actions by Uganda beginning in August 1998. However, as the Parties do
not agree on the characterization of events in that month, the Court
deems it appropriate first to analyse events which occurred a few months
earlier, and the rules of international law applicable to them.

   45. Relations between Laurent-Désiré Kabila and the Ugandan Gov-
ernment had been close, and with the coming to power of the former
there was a common interest in controlling anti-government rebels who
were active along the Congo-Uganda border, carrying out in particular
cross-border attacks against Uganda. It seems certain that from mid-
1997 and during the first part of 1998 Uganda was being allowed to
engage in military action against anti-Ugandan rebels in the eastern part
of Congolese territory. Uganda claims that its troops had been invited
into eastern Congo by President Kabila when he came to power in May
1997. The DRC has acknowledged that “Ugandan troops were present
on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the con-
sent of the country’s lawful government”. It is clear from the materials
put before the Court that in the period preceding August 1998 the DRC
did not object to Uganda’s military presence and activities in its eastern
border area. The written pleadings of the DRC make reference to author-
ized Ugandan operations from September 1997 onwards. There is refer-
ence to such authorized action by Uganda on 19 December 1997, in
early February 1998 and again in early July 1998, when the DRC author-


  56. Uganda characterizes the situation at the beginning of August




1998 as that of a state of civil war in the DRC — a situation in which
President Kabila had turned to neighbouring Powers for assistance,
including, notably, the Sudan (see paragraphs 120-129 below). These
events caused great security concerns to Uganda. Uganda regarded the
Sudan as a long-time enemy, which now, as a result of the invitation
from President Kabila, had a free rein to act against Uganda and was
better placed strategically to do so. Uganda strongly denies that it
engaged in military activity beyond the eastern border area until 11 Sep-
tember. That military activity by its troops occurred in the east dur-
ing August is not denied by Uganda. But it insists that it was not part of
a plan agreed with Rwanda to overthrow President Kabila : it was rather
actions taken by virtue of the consent given by the DRC to the opera-
tions by Uganda in the east, along their common border.



   57. In accordance with its practice, the Court will first make its own
determination of the facts and then apply the relevant rules of interna-
tional law to the facts which it has found to have existed. The Court will
not attempt a determination of the overall factual situation as it applied
to the vast territory of the DRC from August 1998 till July 2003. It will
make such findings of fact as are necessary for it to be able to respond to
the first submission of the DRC, the defences offered by Uganda, and the
first submissions of Uganda as regards its counter-claims. It is not the
task of the Court to make findings of fact (even if it were in a position to
do so) beyond these parameters.

  58. These findings of fact necessarily entail an assessment of the evi-
dence. The Court has in this case been presented with a vast amount of
materials proffered by the Parties in support of their versions of the facts.
The Court has not only the task of deciding which of those materials
must be considered relevant, but also the duty to determine which of
them have probative value with regard to the alleged facts. The greater
part of these evidentiary materials appear in the annexes of the Parties to
their written pleadings. The Parties were also authorized by the Court to
produce new documents at a later stage. In the event, these contained
important items. There has also been reference, in both the written and
the oral pleadings, to material not annexed to the written pleadings but
which the Court has treated as “part of a publication readily available”
under Article 56, paragraph 4, of its Rules of Court. Those, too, have
been examined by the Court for purposes of its determination of the rele-
vant facts.

   59. As it has done in the past, the Court will examine the facts relevant
to each of the component elements of the claims advanced by the Parties.
In so doing, it will identify the documents relied on and make its own
clear assessment of their weight, reliability and value. In accordance with




its prior practice, the Court will explain what items it should eliminate
from further consideration (see Military and Paramilitary Activities in
and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 50, para. 85 ; see equally the practice
followed in the case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular
Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 3).

   60. Both Parties have presented the Court with a vast amount of docu-
mentation. The documents advanced in supporting findings of fact in the
present case include, inter alia, resolutions of the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights, reports and briefings of the OAU, communiqués by
Heads of State, letters of the Parties to the Security Council, reports of
the Secretary-General on MONUC, reports of the United Nations Panels

as to the source of this tape. There do exist letters of August 2001 passing
between the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the
Congolese Government on the exchange of Ugandan prisoners, one of
whom is named as Salim Byaruhanga. However, the ICRC never refers
to this person as a member of the UPDF. Uganda has also furnished the
Court with a notarized affidavit of the Chief of Staff of the UPDF saying
that there were no Ugandan prisoners of war in the DRC, nor any officer
by the name of Salim Byaruhanga. This affidavit is stated to have been
prepared in November 2002, in view of the forthcoming case before the
International Court of Justice. The Court recalls that it has elsewhere
observed that a member of the government of a State engaged in litiga-
tion before this Court — and especially litigation relating to armed con-
flict — “will probably tend to identify himself with the interests of his
country” (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
(Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1986, p. 43, para. 70). The same may be said of a senior military
officer of such a State, and “while in no way impugning the honour or
veracity” of such a person, the Court should “treat such evidence with
great reserve” (ibid.).


   66. The Court observes that, even if such a person existed and even if
he was a prisoner of war, there is nothing in the ICRC letters that refers
to his participation (or to the participation of other Ugandan nationals)
at Kitona. Equally, the PANA Agency press communiqué of 17 Septem-
ber 2001 mentions Salim Byaruhanga when referring to the release of

the Porter Commission in relation to the month of September 1998 refers
to Kisangani (1 September) ; Munubele (17 September) ; Bengamisa
(18 September) ; Banalia (19 September) ; Isiro (20 September) ; Faladje
(23 September) ; and Tele Bridge (29 September). Kisangani (1 Septem-
ber) and Isiro (20 September) are acknowledged by Uganda as having
been “taken” by its forces (and not just as locations passed through).
   82. As for the events of October 1998, Uganda has confirmed that it
was at Buta on 3 October and Aketi on 6 October. The DRC lists the
taking of Aketi as 8 November (response to the question put by Judge
Kooijmans), but the Court sees no reason for this date to be preferred.




Both Parties agree that Buta was taken on 3 October and Dulia on
27 October. The Porter Commission was informed that Ugandan troops
were present at Bafwasende on 12 October.

  83. The DRC has alleged that Kindu was taken by Ugandan troops
on 20 October 1998 ; this was denied in some detail by Uganda in its
Rejoinder. No response was made in the oral pleadings by the DRC to
the reasons given by Uganda for denying it had taken Kindu. Nor is
Kindu in the listing given by the Ugandan military authorities to the
Porter Commission. The Court does not feel it has convincing evidence
as to Kindu having been taken by Ugandan forces in October 1998.

   84. There is agreement between the Parties that Bumba was taken on
17 November 1998.
   85. Uganda claims that Lisala was taken on 12 December 1998. The
list contained in the Porter Commission exhibits makes reference to the
location of Benda, with the date of 13 December. Also listed are Titure
(20 December) and Poko (22 December). Uganda insists it “came to”
Businga on 28 December 1998 and not in early February 1999 as claimed
by the DRC ; and to Gemena on 25 December 1998, and not on 10 July
1999 as also claimed by the DRC.

   These discrepancies do not favour the case of Uganda and the Court
accepts the earlier dates claimed by Uganda.
   86. The DRC claims that Ango was taken on 5 January 1999, and this




opposed positions, was whether the calendar for withdrawal and its rela-
tionship to the series of “Major Events”, taken together with the refer-
ence to the “D-Day plus 180 days”, constituted consent by the DRC to
the presence of Ugandan forces for at least 180 days from 10 July 1999 —
and indeed beyond that time if the envisaged necessary “Major Events”
did not occur.
   99. The Court is of the view that, notwithstanding the special features
of the Lusaka Agreement just described, this conclusion cannot be drawn.
The Agreement took as its starting point the realities on the ground.
Among those realities were the major Ugandan military deployment
across vast areas of the DRC and the massive loss of life over the pre-
ceding months. The arrangements made at Lusaka, to progress towards
withdrawal of foreign forces and an eventual peace, with security for all
concerned, were directed at these factors on the ground and at the reali-
ties of the unstable political and security situation. The provisions of the
Lusaka Agreement thus represented an agreed modus operandi for the
parties. They stipulated how the parties should move forward. They did
not purport to qualify the Ugandan military presence in legal terms. In
accepting this modus operandi the DRC did not “consent” to the presence
of Ugandan troops. It simply concurred that there should be a process to
end that reality in an orderly fashion. The DRC was willing to proceed
from the situation on the ground as it existed and in the manner agreed
as most likely to secure the result of a withdrawal of foreign troops in a
stable environment. But it did not thereby recognize the situation on the
ground as legal, either before the Lusaka Agreement or in the period that
would pass until the fulfilment of its terms.




   100. In resolution 1234 of 9 April 1999 the Security Council had called
for the “immediate signing of a ceasefire agreement” allowing for, inter
alia, “the orderly withdrawal of all foreign forces”. The Security Council
fully appreciated that this withdrawal would entail political and security
elements, as shown in paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution 1234 (1999). This
call was reflected three months later in the Lusaka Agreement. But these
arrangements did not preclude the Security Council from continuing to
identify Uganda and Rwanda as having violated the sovereignty and ter-
ritorial integrity of the DRC and as being under an obligation to with-
draw their forces “without further delay, in conformity with the timetable
of the Ceasefire Agreement” (Security Council resolution 1304, 16 June
2000), i.e., without any delay to the modus operandi provisions agreed
upon by the parties.

  101. This conclusion as to the effect of the Lusaka Agreement upon
the legality of the presence of Ugandan troops on Congolese territory did
not change with the revisions to the timetable that became necessary. The




Kampala Disengagement Plan of 8 April 2000 and the Harare Dis-
engagement Plan of 6 December 2000 provided for new schedules for
withdrawal, it having become apparent that the original schedule in
the Annex to the Lusaka Agreement was unrealistic. While the status of
Ugandan troops remained unchanged, the delay in relation to the D-Day
plus 180 days envisaged in the Lusaka Agreement likewise did not change
the legal status of the presence of Uganda, all parties having agreed to
these delays to the withdrawal calendar.
  102. The Luanda Agreement, a bilateral agreement between the DRC
and Uganda on “withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, co-operation and normalisation of relations
between the two countries”, alters the terms of the multilateral Lusaka
Agreement. The other parties offered no objection.

   103. The withdrawal of Ugandan forces was now to be carried out “in
accordance with the Implementation Plan marked Annex “A’ and
attached thereto” (Art. 1, para. 1). This envisaged the completion of
withdrawal within 100 days after signature, save for the areas of Gbado-
lite, Beni and their vicinities, where there was to be an immediate with-
drawal of troops (Art. 1, para. 2). The Parties also agreed that
      “the Ugandan troops shall remain on the slopes of Mt. Ruwenzori
      until the Parties put in place security mechanisms guaranteeing
      Uganda’s security, including training and co-ordinated patrol of the
      common border”.
   104. The Court observes that, as with the Lusaka Agreement, none of
these elements purport generally to determine that Ugandan forces had
been legally present on the territory of the DRC. The Luanda Agreement
revised the modus operandi for achieving the withdrawal of Ugandan
forces in a stable security situation. It was now agreed — without refer-
ence to whether or not Ugandan forces had been present in the area when
the agreement was signed, and to whether any such presence was law-
ful — that their presence on Mount Ruwenzori should be authorized, if
need be, after the withdrawal elsewhere had been completed until appro-
priate security mechanisms had been put in place. The Court observes
that this reflects the acknowledgment by both Parties of Uganda’s secu-
rity needs in the area, without pronouncing upon the legality of prior
Ugandan military actions there or elsewhere.
   105. The Court thus concludes that the various treaties directed to
achieving and maintaining a ceasefire, the withdrawal of foreign forces
and the stabilization of relations between the DRC and Uganda did not
(save for the limited exception regarding the border region of the Ruwen-
zori Mountains contained in the Luanda Agreement) constitute consent

regarded the military actions throughout August 1998 as already part
and parcel of operation “Safe Haven”.

   114. Thus Mr. Kavuma, the Minister of State for Defence, informed
the Porter Commission that the UPDF troops first crossed the border at
the beginning of August 1998, at the time of the rebellion against Presi-
dent Kabila, “when there was confusion inside the DRC” (Porter Com-
mission document CW/01/02 23/07/01, p. 23). He confirmed that this
“entry” was “to defend our security interests”. The commander of the
Ugandan forces in the DRC, General Kazini, who had immediate control
in the field, informing Kampala and receiving thereafter any further
orders, was asked “[w]hen was ‘Operation Safe Haven’ ? When did it
commence ?” He replied “[i]t was in the month of August. That very
month of August 1998. ‘Safe Haven’ started after the capture of Beni,
that was on 7 August 1998.” (CW/01/03 24/07/01, p. 774.) General Kazini
emphasized that the Beni operation was the watershed : “So before that . . .
‘Operation Safe Haven’ had not started. It was the normal UPDF opera-
tions — counter-insurgency operations in the Rwenzoris before that date
of 7 August, 1998.” (CW/01/03 24/07/01, p. 129.) He spoke of “the earlier
plan” being that both Governments, in the form of the UPDF and the
FAC, would jointly deal with the rebels along the border. “But now this
new phenomenon had developed : there was a mutiny, the rebels were
taking control of those areas. So we decided to launch an offensive
together with the rebels, a special operation we code-named ‘Safe
Haven’.” General Kazini was asked by Justice Porter what was the objec-
tive of this joint offensive with the rebels. General Kazini replied “[t]o
crush the bandits together with their FAC allies” and confirmed that by
“FAC” he meant the “Congolese Government Army” (CW/01/03 24/07/
01, p. 129).






   115. It is thus clear to the Court that Uganda itself actually regarded
the military events of August 1998 as part and parcel of operation “Safe
Haven”, and not as falling within whatever “mutual understandings”
there had previously been.
   116. The Court has noted that within a very short space of time Ugan-
dan forces had moved rapidly beyond these border towns. It is agreed by
all that by 1 September 1998 the UPDF was at Kisangani, very far from
the border. Furthermore, Lieutenant Colonel Magenyi informed the
Porter Commission, under examination, that he had entered the DRC
on 13 August and stayed there till mid-February 1999. He was based
at Isiro, some 580 km from the border. His brigade had fought its way
there : “we were fighting the ADFs who were supported by the FAC”.

   117. Accordingly, the Court will make no distinction between the
events of August 1998 and those in the ensuing months.
   118. Before this Court Uganda has qualified its action starting from
mid-September 1998 as action in self-defence. The Court will thus exam-
ine whether, throughout the period when its forces were rapidly advan-
cing across the DRC, Uganda was entitled to engage in military action
in self-defence against the DRC. For these purposes, the Court will not
examine whether each individual military action by the UPDF could
have been characterized as action in self-defence, unless it can be shown,
as a general proposition, that Uganda was entitled to act in self-defence
in the DRC in the period from August 1998 till June 2003.

   119. The Court first observes that the objectives of operation “Safe
Haven”, as stated in the Ugandan High Command document (see para-
graph 109 above), were not consonant with the concept of self-defence as
understood in international law.
   120. Uganda in its response to the question put to it by Judge Kooij-
mans (see paragraph 22 above) confirms that the changed policies of
President Kabila had meant that co-operation in controlling insurgency
in the border areas had been replaced by “stepped-up cross-border attacks
against Uganda by the ADF, which was being re-supplied and re-equipped
by the Sudan and the DRC Government”. The Court considers that, in
order to ascertain whether Uganda was entitled to engage in military
action on Congolese territory in self-defence, it is first necessary to exam-
ine the reliability of these claims. It will thus begin by an examination of
the evidence concerning the role that the Sudan was playing in the DRC
at the relevant time.

   121. Uganda claimed that there was a tripartite conspiracy in 1998
between the DRC, the ADF and the Sudan ; that the Sudan provided
military assistance to the DRC’s army and to anti-Ugandan rebel groups ;
that the Sudan used Congo airfields to deliver materiel ; that the Sudan
airlifted rebels and its own army units around the country ; that Sudanese
aircraft bombed the UPDF positions at Bunia on 26 August 1998 ; that a




Sudanese brigade of 2,500 troops was in Gbadolite and was preparing to
engage the UPDF forces in eastern Congo ; and that the DRC encour-
aged and facilitated stepped-up cross border attacks from May 1998
onwards.
   122. The Court observes, more specifically, that in its Counter-Memo-
rial Uganda claimed that from 1994 to 1997 anti-Ugandan insurgents
“received direct support from the Government of Sudan” and that
the latter trained and armed insurgent groups, in part to destabilize
Uganda’s status as a “good example” in Africa. For this, Uganda relied on
a Human Rights Watch (hereinafter HRW) report. The Court notes that
this report is on the subject of slavery in the Sudan and does not assist
with the issue before the Court. It also relied on a Ugandan political
report which simply claimed, without offering supporting evidence, that
the Sudan was backing groups launching attacks from the DRC. It
further relies on an HRW report of 2000 stating that the Sudan was pro-
viding military and logistical assistance to the LRA, in the north of
Uganda, and to the SPLM/A (by which Uganda does not claim to have
been attacked). The claims relating to the LRA, which are also contained
in the Counter-Memorial of Uganda, have no relevance to the present
case. No more relevant is the HRW report of 1998 criticizing the use of
child soldiers in northern Uganda.

   123. The Court has next examined the evidence advanced to support
the assertion that the Sudan was supporting anti-Ugandan groups which
were based in the DRC, namely FUNA, UNRF II and NALU. This con-
sists of a Ugandan political report of 1998 which itself offers no evidence,
and an address by President Museveni of 2000. These documents do not
constitute probative evidence of the points claimed.
   124. Uganda states that President Kabila entered into an alliance with
the Sudan, “which he invited to occupy and utilise airfields in north-
eastern Congo for two purposes : delivering arms and other supplies to
the insurgents ; and conducting aerial bombardment of Uganda towns


  129. It was said by Uganda that the DRC had effectively admitted the
threat to Uganda’s security posed by the Sudan, following the claimed
series of meetings between President Kabila and Sudanese officials




in May, August and September 1998. In support of these claims Uganda
referred the Court to a 1999 ICG report, “How Kabila Lost His Way” ;
although not provided in the annexes, this report was in the public
domain and the Court has ascertained its terms. Reliance is also placed
on a political statement by the Ugandan High Command. The Court
observes that this does not constitute reliable evidence and in any event it
speaks only of the reason for the mid-September deployment of troops.
The Court has also found that it cannot rely as persuasive evidence on a
further series of documents said to support these various claims relating
to the Sudan, all being internal political documents. The Court has exam-
ined the notarized affidavit of 2002 of the Ugandan Ambassador to the
DRC, which refers to documents that allegedly were at the Ugandan
Embassy in Kinshasa, showing that “the Sudanese government was
supplying ADF rebels”. While a notarized affidavit is entitled to a
certain respect, the Court must observe that it is provided by a party in
the case and provides at best indirect “information” that is unverified.




  130. The Court observes that it has not been presented with evidence
that can safely be relied on in a court of law to prove that there was an
agreement between the DRC and the Sudan to participate in or support
military action against Uganda ; or that any action by the Sudan (of itself
factually uncertain) was of such a character as to justify Uganda’s claim
that it was acting in self-defence.

  131. The Court has also examined, in the context of ascertaining
whether Uganda could have been said to have acted in self-defence, the
evidence for Uganda’s claims that from May 1998 onwards the fre-
quency, intensity and destructiveness of cross-border attacks by the ADF
“increased significantly”, and that this was due to support from the DRC
and from the Sudan.

   132. The Court is convinced that the evidence does show a series of
attacks occurring within the relevant time-frame, namely : an attack on
Kichwamba Technical School of 8 June 1998, in which 33 students were
killed and 106 abducted ; an attack near Kichwamba, in which five were
killed ; an attack on Benyangule village on 26 June, in which 11 persons
were killed or wounded ; the abduction of 19 seminarians at Kiburara on
5 July; an attack on Kasese town on 1 August, in which three persons
were killed. A sixth attack was claimed at the oral hearings to have
occurred at Kijarumba, with 33 fatalities. The Court has not been able to
ascertain the facts as to this latter incident.







   133. The DRC does not deny that a number of attacks took place, but
its position is that the ADF alone was responsible for them. The docu-
ments relied on by Uganda for its entitlement to use force in self-defence
against the DRC include a report of the interrogation of a captured ADF
rebel, who admits participating in the Kichwamba attack and refers to an
“intention” to obtain logistical support and sanctuary from the Congo-
lese Government ; this report is not signed by the person making the
statement, nor does it implicate the DRC. Uganda also relies on a docu-
ment entitled “Chronological Illustration of Acts of Destabilisation by
Sudan and Congo Based Dissidents”, which is a Ugandan military docu-
ment. Further, some articles in newspapers relied on by Uganda in fact
blame only the ADF for the attacks. A very few do mention the Sudan.
Only some internal documents, namely unsigned witness statements,
make any reference to Congolese involvement in these acts.



  134. The Court observes that this is also the case as regards the docu-
ments said to show that President Kabila provided covert support to the
ADF. These may all be described as internal documents, often with no
authenticating features, and containing unsigned, unauthenticated and
sometimes illegible witness statements. These do not have the quality or
character to satisfy the Court as to the matters claimed.


   135. In oral pleadings Uganda again referred to these “stepped up
attacks”. Reference was made to an ICG report of August 1998, “North
Kivu, into the Quagmire”. Although not provided in the annexes, this
report was in the public domain and the Court has ascertained its terms.
It speaks of the ADF as being financed by Iran and the Sudan. It further
states that the ADF is “[e]xploiting the incapacity of the Congolese
Armed Forces” in controlling areas of North Kivu with neighbour
Uganda. This independent report does seem to suggest some Sudanese
support for the ADF’s activities. It also implies that this was not a matter
of Congolese policy, but rather a reflection of its inability to control
events along its border.


  136. Uganda relies on certain documents annexed by the DRC to its
Reply. However, the Court does not find this evidence weighty and con-
vincing. It consists of a bundle of news reports of variable reliability,
which go no further than to say that unconfirmed reports had been
received that the Sudan was flying military supplies to Juba and Dungu.
The Court has therefore not found probative such media reports as the
IRIN update for 12 to 14 September 1998, stating that Hutu rebels were
being trained in southern Sudan, and the IRIN update for 16 September
1998, stating that “rebels claim Sudan is supporting Kabila at Kindu”.




Neither has the Court relied on the (unreferenced and unsourced) claim
that President Kabila made a secret visit to Khartoum on 25 August 1998
nor on the extract from Mr. Bemba’s book Le choix de la liberté stating
that 108 Sudanese soldiers were in the DRC, under the command of the
Congolese army, to defend the area around Gbadolite.



   137. Nor has the Court been able to satisfy itself as to certain internal
military intelligence documents, belatedly offered, which lack explana-
tions as to how the information was obtained (e.g. Revelations of Com-
mander Junju Juma (former commanding officer in the ADF) of 17 May
2000, undated Revelations by Issa Twatera (former commanding officer
in the ADF)).

  138. A further “fact” relied on by Uganda in this case as entitling it to
act in self-defence is that the DRC incorporated anti-Ugandan rebel
groups and Interahamwe militia into the FAC. The Court will examine
the evidence and apply the law to its findings.

  139. In its Counter-Memorial, Uganda claimed that President Kabila
had incorporated into his army thousands of ex-FAR and Interahamwe
génocidaires in May 1998. A United States State Department statement
in October 1998 condemned the DRC’s recruitment and training of
former perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, thus giving some credence
to the reports internal to Uganda that were put before the Court, even
though these lacked signatures or particulars of sources relied on. But
this claim, even if true, seems to have relevance for Rwanda rather than
Uganda.

     FINDINGS OF LAW ON THE PROHIBITION AGAINST THE USE OF FORCE


  148. The prohibition against the use of force is a cornerstone of the
United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter requires
that :
        “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from
      the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
      independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with
      the Purposes of the United Nations.”

Article 51 of the Charter may justify a use of force in self-defence only
within the strict confines there laid down. It does not allow the use of
force by a State to protect perceived security interests beyond these




parameters. Other means are available to a concerned State, including, in
particular, recourse to the Security Council.

  149. The Court has found that, from 7 August 1998 onwards, Uganda
engaged in the use of force for purposes and in locations for which it had
no consent whatever. The Court has also found that the events attested
to by Uganda did not justify recourse to the use of force in self-defence.

   150. The long series of resolutions passed by the Security Council
(1234 (1999), 1258 (1999), 1273 (1999), 1279 (1999), 1291 (2000), 1304
(2000), 1316 (2000), 1323 (2000), 1332 (2000), 1341 (2001), 1355 (2001),
1376 (2001), 1399 (2002), 1417 (2002), 1445 (2002), 1457 (2003), 1468
(2003), 1484 (2003), 1489 (2003), 1493 (2003), 1499 (2003), 1501 (2003),
1522 (2004), 1533 (2004), 1552 (2004), 1555 (2004), 1565 (2004), 1592
(2005), 1596 (2005), 1616 (2005) and 1621 (2005) ) and the need for the
United Nations to deploy MONUC, as well as the prolonged efforts by
the United Nations to restore peace in the region and full sovereignty to
the DRC over its territory, testify to the magnitude of the military events
and the attendant suffering. The same may be said of the need to appoint
a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights, a Special Envoy
of the Secretary-General for that region, and the establishment of a panel
(later reconstituted) to report on certain of the categories of facts relating
to natural resources.

  151. The Court recalls that on 9 April 1999 the Security Council deter-
mined the conflict to constitute a threat to peace, security and stability in
the region. In demanding an end to hostilities and a political solution to
the conflict (which call was to lead to the Lusaka Agreement of 10 July
1999), the Security Council deplored the continued fighting and presence
of foreign forces in the DRC and called for the States concerned “to
bring to an end the presence of these uninvited forces” (United Nations
doc. S/RES/1234, 9 April 1999).
  152. The United Nations has throughout this long series of carefully
balanced resolutions and detailed reports recognized that all States in the
region must bear their responsibility for finding a solution that would
bring peace and stability. The Court notes, however, that this widespread
responsibility of the States of the region cannot excuse the unlawful mili-
tary action of Uganda.

  153. The evidence has shown that the UPDF traversed vast areas of
the DRC, violating the sovereignty of that country. It engaged in military
operations in a multitude of locations, including Bunia, Kisangani,
Gbadolite and Ituri, and many others. These were grave violations of
Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter.

  154. The Court notes that the Security Council, on 16 June 2000,
expressed “outrage at renewed fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan




forces in Kisangani”, and condemned it as a “violation of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo”
(United Nations doc. S/RES/1304 (2000)).

   155. The Court further observes that Uganda — as is clear from the
evidence given by General Kazini and General Kavuma to the Porter
Commission (see above, paragraph 114) — decided in early August 1998
to launch an offensive together with various factions which sought to
overthrow the Government of the DRC. The DRC has in particular
claimed that, from September 1998 onwards, Uganda both created and
controlled the MLC rebel group led by Mr. Bemba.

   156. The DRC also points to the book written by Mr. Bemba (see para-
graph 69 above) to support this contention, as well as to the fact that in
the Harare Disengagement Plan the MLC and UPDF are treated as a
single unit.
   157. For its part, Uganda acknowledges that it assisted the MLC dur-
ing fighting between late September 1998 and July 1999, while insisting
that its assistance to Mr. Bemba “was always limited and heavily condi-
tioned”. Uganda has explained that it gave “just enough” military sup-
port to the MLC to help Uganda achieve its objectives of driving out the
Sudanese and Chadian troops from the DRC, and of taking over the air-
fields between Gbadolite and the Ugandan border ; Uganda asserts that it
did not go beyond this.

   158. The Court observes that the pages cited by the DRC in
Mr. Bemba’s book do not in fact support the claim of “the creation” of
the MLC by Uganda, and cover the later period of March-July 1999.
The Court has noted the description in Mr. Bemba’s book of the training
of his men by Ugandan military instructors and finds that this accords
with statements he made at that time, as recorded in the ICG report
of 20 August 1999. The Court has equally noted Mr. Bemba’s insistence,
in November 1999, that, while he was receiving support, it was he who
was in control of the military venture and not Uganda. The Court is
equally of the view that the Harare Disengagement Plan merely sought
to identify locations of the various parties, without passing on their
relationships to each other.


   159. The Court has not relied on various other items offered as evi-
dence on this point by the DRC, finding them, uncorroborated, based on
second-hand reports, or not in fact saying what they are alleged to say by
the DRC, or even in some cases partisan. The Court has for such reasons
set aside the ICG report of 17 November, the HRW Report of March
2001, passages from the Secretary-General’s report on MONUC of 4 Sep-
tember 2000 (where reliance on second-hand reports is acknowledged) ;
articles in the IRIN bulletin and Jeune Afrique ; and the statement of a




deserter who was co-operating with the Congolese military commission
in preparing a statement for purposes of the present proceedings.


   160. The Court concludes that there is no credible evidence to suggest
that Uganda created the MLC. Uganda has acknowledged giving train-
ing and military support and there is evidence to that effect. The Court
has not received probative evidence that Uganda controlled, or could
control, the manner in which Mr. Bemba put such assistance to use. In
the view of the Court, the conduct of the MLC was not that of “an
organ” of Uganda (Article 4, International Law Commission Draft
Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts,
2001), nor that of an entity exercising elements of governmental authority
on its behalf (Art. 5). The Court has considered whether the MLC’s
conduct was “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of”
Uganda (Art. 8) and finds that there is no probative evidence by
reference to which it has been persuaded that this was the case. Accord-
ingly, no issue arises in the present case as to whether the requisite tests
are met for sufficiency of control of paramilitaries (see Military and
Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United
States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 62-65,
paras. 109-115).

   161. The Court would comment, however, that, even if the evidence
does not suggest that the MLC’s conduct is attributable to Uganda, the
training and military support given by Uganda to the ALC, the military
wing of the MLC, violates certain obligations of international law.

  162. Thus the Declaration on Principles of International Law
Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter “the
Declaration on Friendly Relations”) provides that :
         “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating,
      assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in
      another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its terri-
      tory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts
      referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”
      (General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970.)

  The Declaration further provides that
      “no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate
      subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent
      overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in
      another State” (ibid.).





These provisions are declaratory of customary international law.

   163. The Court considers that the obligations arising under the prin-
ciples of non-use of force and non-intervention were violated by Uganda
even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila,
and were directed to securing towns and airports for reason of its per-
ceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those
engaged in civil war.

   164. In the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and
against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the Court
made it clear that the principle of non-intervention prohibits a State “to
intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support
of an internal opposition in another State” (I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 108,
para. 206). The Court notes that in the present case it has been presented
with probative evidence as to military intervention. The Court further
affirms that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention “will
also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a
breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations”
(ibid., pp. 109-110, para. 209).
   165. In relation to the first of the DRC’s final submissions, the Court
accordingly concludes that Uganda has violated the sovereignty and also
the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted
an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC and in the civil war
there raging. The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such
a magnitude and duration that the Court considers it to be a grave viola-
tion of the prohibition on the use of force expressed in Article 2, para-
graph 4, of the Charter.

                                    * * *
   166. Before turning to the second and third submissions of the DRC,
dealing with alleged violations by Uganda of its obligations under inter-
national human rights law and international humanitarian law and the
illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC, it is essential for
the Court to consider the question as to whether or not Uganda was an
occupying Power in the parts of Congolese territory where its troops
were present at the relevant time.


                                    *   *

                 THE ISSUE OF BELLIGERENT OCCUPATION

   167. The DRC asserts that the border regions of eastern Congo were
attacked by Ugandan forces between 7 and 8 August 1998, and that more
areas fell under the control of Ugandan troops over the following months
with the advance of the UPDF into Congolese territory. It further points




out that “the territories occupied by Uganda have varied in size as the
conflict has developed” : the area of occupation initially covered Orien-
tale province and part of North Kivu province ; in the course of 1999 it
increased to cover a major part of Equateur province. The DRC specifies
that the territories occupied extended from Bunia and Beni, close to the
eastern border, to Bururu and Mobenzene, in the far north-western part
of the DRC ; and that “the southern boundary of the occupied area [ran]
north of the towns of Mbandaka westwards, then [extended] east to
Kisangani, rejoining the Ugandan border between Goma and Butembo”.
According to the DRC, the occupation of its territory ended with the
withdrawal of the Ugandan army on 2 June 2003.


   168. The DRC contends that “the UPDF set up an occupation zone,
which it administered both directly and indirectly”, in the latter case by
way of the creation of and active support for various Congolese rebel fac-
tions. As an example of such administration, the DRC refers to the cre-
ation of a new province within its territory. In June 1999, the Ugandan
authorities, in addition to the existing ten provinces, created an 11th
province in the north-east of the DRC, in the vicinity of the Ugandan
frontier. The “Kibali-Ituri” province thus created was the result of
merging the districts of Ituri and Haut-Uélé, detached from Orientale
province. On 18 June 1999 General Kazini, commander of the Ugandan
forces in the DRC, “appointed Ms Adèle Lotsove, previously Deputy
Governor of Orientale Province, to govern this new province”. The DRC
further asserts that acts of administration by Uganda of this province
continued until the withdrawal of Ugandan troops. In support of this
contention, the DRC states that Colonel Muzoora, of the UPDF, exer-
cised de facto the duties of governor of the province between January
and May 2001, and that “at least two of the five governors who suc-
ceeded Ms Lotsove up until 2003 were relieved of their duties by the
Ugandan military authorities, sometimes under threat of force”. The
DRC claims that the Ugandan authorities were directly involved “in the
political life of the occupied regions” and, citing the Ugandan daily news-
paper New Vision, that “Uganda has even gone so far as to supervise
local elections”. The DRC also refers to the Sixth report of the Secretary-
General on MONUC, which describes the situation in Bunia (capital of
Ituri district) in the following terms : “[s]ince 22 January, MONUC mili-
tary observers in Bunia have reported the situation in the town to be
tense but with UPDF in effective control”.


  169. Finally, according to the DRC, the fact that Ugandan troops
were not present in every location in the vast territory of the north and
east of the DRC “in no way prevents Uganda from being considered an
occupying power in the localities or areas which were controlled by its
armed forces”. The DRC claims that the notion of occupation in inter-




national law, as reflected in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the
Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Con-
vention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter “the Hague Regulations of
1907”), is closely tied to the control exercised by the troops of the State
operating on parts, extensive or not, of the territory of the occupied
State. Thus, “rather than the omnipresence of the occupying State’s
armed forces, it is that State’s ability to assert its authority which the
Hague Regulations look to as the criterion for defining the notion of
occupying State”.

                                       *
   170. For its part, Uganda denies that it was an occupying Power in the
areas where UPDF troops were present. It argues that, in view of the
small number of its troops in the territory of the DRC, i.e. fewer than
10,000 soldiers “at the height of the deployment”, they could not have





and private property. With regard to the clashes between Uganda and
Rwanda in the city of Kisangani in 1999 and 2000, the DRC refers, in
particular, to Security Council resolution 1304 (2000), in which the
Council deplored, inter alia, “the damage to property inflicted by the
forces of Uganda and Rwanda on the Congolese population”. The DRC
also alleges that the property and resources of the civilian populations in
the eastern Congolese regions occupied by the Ugandan army were
destroyed on certain occasions by UPDF soldiers as part of a “scorched
earth” policy aimed at combating ADF rebels.

   185. The DRC claims that several hundred Congolese children were
forcibly recruited by the UPDF and taken to Uganda for ideological and
military training in the year 2000. In particular, according to the DRC,
many children were abducted in August 2000 in the areas of Bunia, Beni
and Butembo and given military training at the Kyankwanzi camp in
Uganda with a view to incorporating them into the Ugandan armed
forces. The DRC maintains that the abducted children were only able to
leave the Kyankwanzi training camp for final repatriation to the DRC at
the beginning of July 2001 after persistent efforts by UNICEF and the
United Nations to ensure their release.

   186. The DRC contends that the Ugandan armed forces failed to pro-
tect the civilian population in combat operations with other belligerents.
Thus it alleges that attacks were carried out by the UPDF without any
distinction being made between combatants and non-combatants. In this
regard, the DRC makes specific reference to fighting between Ugandan
and Rwandan forces in Kisangani in 1999 and 2000, causing widespread
loss of life within the civilian population and great damage to the city’s
infrastructure and housing. In support of its claims, the DRC cites vari-
ous reports of Congolese and international non-governmental organiza-
tions and refers extensively to the June 2000 MONUC Report and to
the December 2000 report by the United Nations inter-agency assessment
mission, which went to Kisangani pursuant to Security Council resolu-
tion 1304 (2000). The DRC notes that the latter report referred to “sys-
tematic violations of international humanitarian law and indiscriminate
attacks on civilians” committed by Uganda and Rwanda as they fought
each other.


   187. The DRC claims that Ugandan troops were involved in ethnic
conflicts between groups in the Congolese population, particularly
between Hema and Lendu in the Ituri region, resulting in thousands of
civilian casualties. According to the DRC, UPDF forces openly sided
with the Hema ethnic group because of “alleged ethnic links between its
members and the Ugandan population”. In one series of cases, the DRC
alleges that Ugandan armed forces provided direct military support to
Congolese factions and joined with them in perpetrating massacres of




civilians. The DRC further claims that Uganda not only supported one
of the groups but also provided training and equipment for other groups
over time, thereby aggravating the local conflicts.


   188. The DRC also asserts that, on several occasions, Ugandan forces
passively witnessed atrocities committed by the members of local militias
in Ituri. In this connection, the DRC refers to various incidents attested
to by reports emanating from the United Nations and MONUC, and
from Congolese and international non-governmental organizations. In
particular, the DRC refers to a massacre of ethnic Lendu carried out by
ethnic Hema militias in Bunia on 19 January 2001. The DRC states that
similar events occurred in other localities.

   189. The DRC charges that Uganda breached its obligation of vigi-
lance incumbent upon it as an occupying Power by failing to enforce
respect for human rights and international humanitarian law in the occu-
pied regions, and particularly in Ituri. The DRC argues that the need to
ensure full respect for fundamental rights in the territories occupied by
the Ugandan army was similarly emphasized by the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights.
   190. The DRC argues that, by its actions, Uganda has violated provi-
sions of the Hague Regulations of 1907 ; the Fourth Geneva Convention
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August
1949 ; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ; the Pro-
tocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and
relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts
(Protocol I), of 8 June 1977 ; the African Charter on Human and Peoples’
Rights ; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment ; and the African Charter on the
Rights and Welfare of the Child.

                                    *
   191. Uganda contends that the DRC has consistently failed to provide
any credible evidentiary basis to support its allegations of the involve-
ment of Ugandan troops in massacres, torture and ill-treatment of Con-
golese civilians, supposed acts of plunder and scorched earth policy,
destruction of Congolese villages and civilian dwellings, and looting of
private property. In this regard, Uganda refers to each of the incidents
alleged by the DRC and argues that the documentation relied upon by
the DRC to prove its claims either fails to show that the incident
occurred, or fails to show any involvement of Ugandan troops. In more
general terms, Uganda points to the unreliability of the evidence adduced
by the DRC, claiming that it does not distinguish between the various
armies operating in eastern Congo during the relevant period. Uganda
also maintains that the DRC relies on partisan sources of information,





I.C.J. Reports 1963, pp. 33-34, 37, 38), would preclude the Court from
exercising any jurisdiction it might have in relation to the events that
occurred in Kisangani.

                                         *
   199. With reference to the objection raised by Uganda regarding the
Court’s jurisdiction to rule on the events in Kisangani in the absence of
Rwanda from the proceedings, the DRC asserts that “Rwanda’s absence
from these proceedings is totally irrelevant and cannot prevent the Court
from ruling on the question of Uganda’s responsibility”. According to
the DRC,
       “[t]he purpose of the DRC’s claim is simply to secure recognition of
       Uganda’s sole responsibility for the use of force by its own armed
       forces in Congolese territory . . . in and around Kisangani, as well as
       for the serious violations of essential rules of international humani-
       tarian law committed on those occasions” (emphasis in original).

   200. The DRC argues that the Court is competent to adjudicate on the
events in Kisangani “without having to consider the question of whether
it should be Rwanda or Uganda that is held responsible for initiating the
hostilities that led to the various clashes”. The DRC refers to the case
concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) in
support of its contention that there is nothing to prevent the Court from
“exercising its jurisdiction with regard to a respondent State, even in the
absence of other States implicated in the Application”. The DRC argues
that the Monetary Gold and East Timor cases, relied on by Uganda to
support its arguments, are fundamentally different from the present case.
According to the DRC, the application which it filed against Uganda “is
entirely autonomous and independent” and does not bear on any sepa-
rate proceedings instituted by the DRC against other States. The DRC
maintains that “[i]t is Uganda’s responsibility which is the subject-matter
of the Congolese claim, and there is no other ‘indispensable party’ whose
legal interests would form ‘the very subject-matter of the decision’, as in
the Monetary Gold or East Timor precedents”.

   201. The DRC points out that the Court, in its Order of 1 July 2000
indicating provisional measures, “refused to accept Uganda’s reasoning
and agreed to indicate certain measures specifically relating to the events
in Kisangani despite the absence of Rwanda from the proceedings”.

 202. In light of the above considerations, the DRC argues that
Uganda’s objection must be rejected.

                                     *       *
     203. The Court has had to examine questions of this kind on previous




occasions. In the case concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru
(Nauru v. Australia), the Court observed that it is not precluded from
adjudicating upon the claims submitted to it in a case in which a third
State “has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the deci-
sion in the case”, provided that “the legal interests of the third State
which may possibly be affected do not form the very subject-matter of
the decision that is applied for”. The Court further noted that :
         “In the present case, the interests of New Zealand and the United
      Kingdom do not constitute the very subject-matter of the judgment
      to be rendered on the merits of Nauru’s Application and the situa-
      tion is in that respect different from that with which the Court had
      to deal in the Monetary Gold case. In the latter case, the determina-
      tion of Albania’s responsibility was a prerequisite for a decision to
      be taken on Italy’s claims. In the present case, the determination of
      the responsibility of New Zealand or the United Kingdom is not a
      prerequisite for the determination of the responsibility of Australia,
      the only object of Nauru’s claim . . . In the Monetary Gold case the
      link between, on the one hand, the necessary findings regarding,
      Albania’s alleged responsibility and, on the other, the decision
      requested of the Court regarding the allocation of the gold, was not
      purely temporal but also logical . . .

      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
      In the present case, a finding by the Court regarding the existence or
      the content of the responsibility attributed to Australia by Nauru
      might well have implications for the legal situation of the two other
      States concerned, but no finding in respect of that legal situation will
      be needed as a basis for the Court’s decision on Nauru’s claims
      against Australia. Accordingly the Court cannot decline to exercise
      its jurisdiction.” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Aus-
      tralia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992,
      pp. 261-262, para. 55.)
   204. The Court considers that this jurisprudence is applicable in the
current proceedings. In the present case, the interests of Rwanda clearly
do not constitute “the very subject-matter” of the decision to be rendered
by the Court on the DRC’s claims against Uganda, nor is the determina-
tion of Rwanda’s responsibility a prerequisite for such a decision. The
fact that some alleged violations of international human rights law and
international humanitarian law by Uganda occurred in the course of
hostilities between Uganda and Rwanda does not impinge on this
finding. Thus it is not necessary for Rwanda to be a party to this case
for the Court to be able to determine whether Uganda’s conduct was a
violation of these rules of international law.

report on the events in Ituri, January 2002-December 2003 (doc. S/2004/
573 of 16 July 2004, para. 6), that


      “Ugandan army commanders already present in Ituri, instead of try-
      ing to calm the situation, preferred to benefit from the situation and
      support alternately one side or the other according to their political
      and financial interests”.

The above reports are consistent in the presentation of facts, support
each other and are corroborated by other credible sources, such as the
HRW Report “Ituri : Covered in Blood. Ethnically Targeted Violence in
Northeastern DR Congo”, July 2003 (available at http ://hrw.org/reports/
2003/ituri0703/).


   210. The Court finds that there is convincing evidence of the training
in UPDF training camps of child soldiers and of the UPDF’s failure to
prevent the recruitment of child soldiers in areas under its control. The
Fifth Report of the Secretary-General on MONUC (doc. S/2000/1156 of
6 December 2000, para. 75) refers to the confirmed “cross-border depor-
tation of recruited Congolese children from the Bunia, Beni and Butembo
region to Uganda”. The Eleventh Report of the Secretary-General on
MONUC (doc. S/2002/621 of 5 June 2002, para. 47) points out that the
local UPDF authorities in and around Bunia in Ituri district “have failed
to prevent the fresh recruitment or re-recruitment of children” as child
soldiers. MONUC’s special report on the events in Ituri, January 2002-
December 2003 (doc. S/2004/573 of 16 July 2004, para. 148) refers to
several incidents where Congolese children were transferred to UPDF
training camps for military training.



   211. Having examined the case file, the Court considers that it has
credible evidence sufficient to conclude that the UPDF troops committed
acts of killing, torture and other forms of inhumane treatment of the
civilian population, destroyed villages and civilian buildings, failed to dis-
tinguish between civilian and military targets and to protect the civilian
population in fighting with other combatants, incited ethnic conflict and
took no steps to put an end to such conflicts, was involved in the training
of child soldiers, and did not take measures to ensure respect for human
rights and international humanitarian law in the occupied territories.



  212. With regard to the claim by the DRC that Uganda carried out a




deliberate policy of terror, confirmed in its view by the almost total impu-
nity of the soldiers and officers responsible for the alleged atrocities com-
mitted on the territory of the DRC, the Court, in the absence of specific
evidence supporting this claim, does not consider that this allegation has
been proven. The Court, however, wishes to stress that the civil war and
foreign military intervention in the DRC created a general atmosphere of
terror pervading the lives of the Congolese people.

                                     *
   213. The Court turns now to the question as to whether acts and omis-
sions of the UPDF and its officers and soldiers are attributable to
Uganda. The conduct of the UPDF as a whole is clearly attributable to
Uganda, being the conduct of a State organ. According to a well-estab-
lished rule of international law, which is of customary character, “the
conduct of any organ of a State must be regarded as an act of that State”
(Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rap-
porteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.
Reports 1999 (I), p. 87, para. 62). The conduct of individual soldiers and
officers of the UPDF is to be considered as the conduct of a State organ.
In the Court’s view, by virtue of the military status and function of
Ugandan soldiers in the DRC, their conduct is attributable to Uganda.
The contention that the persons concerned did not act in the capacity of
persons exercising governmental authority in the particular circumstances,
is therefore without merit.

  214. It is furthermore irrelevant for the attribution of their conduct to
Uganda whether the UPDF personnel acted contrary to the instructions
given or exceeded their authority. According to a well-established rule of
a customary nature, as reflected in Article 3 of the Fourth Hague Con-
vention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907 as
well as in Article 91 of Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions
of 1949, a party to an armed conflict shall be responsible for all acts by
persons forming part of its armed forces.


                                     *
   215. The Court, having established that the conduct of the UPDF and
of the officers and soldiers of the UPDF is attributable to Uganda, must
now examine whether this conduct constitutes a breach of Uganda’s
international obligations. In this regard, the Court needs to determine the
rules and principles of international human rights law and international
humanitarian law which are relevant for this purpose.

  216. The Court first recalls that it had occasion to address the issues of
the relationship between international humanitarian law and interna-




tional human rights law and of the applicability of international human
rights law instruments outside national territory in its Advisory Opinion
of 9 July 2004 on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In this Advisory Opinion the
Court found that
      “the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease
      in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for
      derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International
      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship
      between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there
      are thus three possible situations : some rights may be exclusively
      matters of international humanitarian law ; others may be exclu-
      sively matters of human rights law ; yet others may be matters of
      both these branches of international law.” (I.C.J. Reports 2004,
      p. 178, para. 106.)
It thus concluded that both branches of international law, namely inter-
national human rights law and international humanitarian law, would
have to be taken into consideration. The Court further concluded that
international human rights instruments are applicable “in respect of acts
done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own terri-
tory”, particularly in occupied territories (ibid., pp. 178-181, paras. 107-
113).
   217. The Court considers that the following instruments in the fields of
international humanitarian law and international human rights law are
applicable, as relevant, in the present case :
— Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land
  annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907.
  Neither the DRC nor Uganda are parties to the Convention. How-
  ever, the Court reiterates that “the provisions of the Hague Regula-

        its jurisdiction or control having engaged in the above-men-
        tioned acts, has violated the following principles of conventional
        and customary law :

        — the applicable rules of international humanitarian law ;
        — respect for the sovereignty of States, including over their
           natural resources ;
        — the duty to promote the realization of the principle of equal-
           ity of peoples and of their right of self-determination, and
           consequently to refrain from exposing peoples to foreign
           subjugation, domination or exploitation ;
        — the principle of non-interference in matters within the
           domestic jurisdiction of States, including economic mat-
           ters.”
  223. The DRC alleges that, following the invasion of the DRC by




Uganda in August 1998, the Ugandan troops “illegally occupying” Con-
golese territory, acting in collaboration with Congolese rebel groups
supported by Uganda, systematically looted and exploited the assets and
natural resources of the DRC. According to the DRC, after the system-
atic looting of natural resources, the Ugandan military and the rebel
groups which it supported “moved on to another phase in the expropria-
tion of the wealth of Congo, by direct exploitation of its resources” for
their own benefit. The DRC contends that the Ugandan army took out-
right control of the entire economic and commercial system in the occu-
pied areas, with almost the entire market in consumer goods being con-
trolled by Ugandan companies and businessmen. The DRC further claims
that UDPF forces have engaged in hunting and plundering of protected
species. The DRC charges that the Ugandan authorities did nothing to
put an end to these activities and indeed encouraged the UPDF, Ugan-
dan companies and rebel groups supported by Uganda to exploit natural
resources on Congolese territory.

   224. The DRC maintains that the highest Ugandan authorities, includ-
ing President Museveni, were aware of the UPDF forces’ involvement in
the plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the
DRC. Moreover, the DRC asserts that these activities were tacitly
supported or even encouraged by the Ugandan authorities, “who saw
in them a way of financing the continuation of the war in the DRC,
‘rewarding’ the military involved in this operation and opening up new
markets to Ugandan companies”.
   225. The DRC claims that the illegal exploitation, plundering and
looting of the DRC’s natural resources by Uganda have been confirmed
in a consistent manner by a variety of independent sources, among them
the Porter Commission Report, the United Nations Panel reports and
reports of national organs and non-governmental organizations. Accord-
ing to the DRC, the facts which it alleges are also corroborated by the
economic data analysed in various reports by independent experts.

  226. The DRC contends that illegal exploitation, plundering and loot-
ing of the DRC’s natural resources constitute violations by Uganda of
“the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC, more specifically of
the DRC’s sovereignty over its natural resources”. In this regard the
DRC refers to the right of States to their natural resources and cites Gen-
eral Assembly resolution 1803 (XVII) on Permanent Sovereignty over
Natural Resources, adopted on 14 December 1962 ; the Declaration on
the Establishment of a New International Economic Order contained in
United Nations General Assembly resolution 3201 (S.VI) of 1 May 1974
and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of
12 December 1974.

  227. The DRC claims that Uganda in all circumstances is responsible




for acts of plunder and illegal exploitation of the resources of the
DRC committed by officers and soldiers of the UPDF as an organ of the
Republic of Uganda. For the DRC it is not relevant whether members
of the Ugandan army acted under, or contrary to, official orders from
their Government or in an official or private capacity.
   228. Turning to the duty of vigilance, the DRC argues that, in relation
to the obligation to respect the sovereignty of States over their natural
resources, this duty implies that a State should take adequate measures to
ensure that its military forces, nationals or groups that it controls do not
engage in illegal exploitation of natural resources on the territory of
another State. The DRC claims that all activities involving exploitation
of natural resources conducted by Ugandan companies and nationals
and rebel movements supported by Uganda were acts of illegal exploita-
tion. The DRC further contends that Uganda took no proper steps to
bring to an end the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the
DRC by members of Ugandan military, private companies or nationals
and by the Congolese rebel movements that it controlled and supported,
thus violating its duty of vigilance.

   229. The DRC asserts that, by engaging in the illegal exploitation,
plundering and looting of the DRC’s natural resources, Uganda also vio-
lated its obligations as an occupying Power under the jus in bello.
According to the DRC, “the detailed rules of the law of armed conflict in
relation to the exploitation of natural resources have to be considered
against the background of this fundamental principle of permanent sov-
ereignty over natural resources”. This principle, in the view of the DRC,
continues to apply at all times, including during armed conflict and occu-
pation.

                                     *
   230. For its part, Uganda maintains that the DRC has not provided
reliable evidence to corroborate its allegations regarding the looting and
illegal exploitation of natural resources of the DRC by Uganda. It claims
that neither the United Nations Panel reports nor the Porter Commission
Report can be considered as supporting the DRC’s allegations. More-
over, according to Uganda, the limited nature of its intervention is
inconsistent with the DRC’s contention that Uganda occupied the
eastern Congo in order to exploit natural resources. Nor, in view of
this fact, could Uganda exercise the pervasive economic control required
to exploit the areas as alleged by the DRC.

   231. Uganda further denies that it has violated the principle of the
Congolese people’s sovereignty over its natural resources. It maintains
that this principle, “which was shaped in a precise historical context (that
of decolonization) and has a very precise purpose”, cannot be applicable
in the context of the present case. Uganda claims that individual acts of




members of the Ugandan military forces committed in their private
capacity and in violation of orders and instructions cannot serve as basis
for attributing to Uganda a wrongful act violating the principle of the
permanent sovereignty of Congolese people over their natural resources.
   232. Uganda likewise denies that it violated its duty of vigilance with
regard to acts of illegal exploitation in the territories where its troops
were present. Uganda does not agree with the contention that it had a
duty of vigilance with regard to the Congolese rebel groups, asserting
that it did not control those groups and had no power over their admin-
istrative acts. Uganda also maintains that, “within the limits of its capa-
bilities, it exercised a high degree of vigilance to ensure that its nationals
did not, through their actions, infringe the Congolese people’s right to
control their natural resources”.
   233. Uganda also contests the view that the alleged breach of its “duty
of vigilance” is founded on Uganda’s failure to prohibit trade “between
its nationals and the territories controlled by the rebels in eastern Congo”.
In Uganda’s view, the de facto authority of Congolese rebel movements
established in eastern Congo could not affect the commercial relations
between the eastern Congo, Uganda and several other States, which were
maintained in the interests of the local populations and essential to the
populations’ survival, and therefore “did not impose an obligation to
apply commercial sanctions”.

   234. Uganda states that the DRC’s contentions that Uganda failed to
take action against illegal activity are without merit. In this regard it
refers to a radio broadcast by President Museveni in December 1998,
which made “it clear that no involvement of the members of the Ugan-
dan armed forces in commercial activities in eastern Congo would be
tolerated”. Furthermore, Uganda points out that “the Porter Commission
found that there was no Ugandan governmental policy to exploit the
DRC’s natural resources”. It maintains that the Porter Commission con-
firmed that the Ugandan Government’s policy was to forbid its officers
and soldiers from engaging in any business or commercial activities in the
DRC. However, in cases where the Porter Commission found that there
was evidence to support allegations that individual soldiers engaged in
commercial activities and looting “acting in a purely private capacity for
their personal enrichment”, the Government of Uganda accepted the
Commission’s recommendations to initiate criminal investigations against
the alleged offenders.


  235. Uganda recognizes that, as found by the Porter Commission,
there were instances of illegal commercial activities or looting committed
by certain members of the Ugandan military forces acting in their private
capacity and in violation of orders and instructions given to them “by the
highest State authorities”. However, Uganda maintains that these indi-
vidual acts cannot be characterized as “internationally wrongful acts” of




Uganda. For Uganda, violations by Ugandan nationals of the internal
law of Uganda or of certain Congolese rules and practices in the territo-
ries where rebels exercised de facto administrative authority, referred to
by the Porter Commission, do not necessarily constitute an internation-
ally wrongful act, “for it is well known that the originating act giving rise
to international responsibility is not an act characterized as ‘illegal’ by
the domestic law of the State but an ‘internationally wrongful act’
imputable to a State”.
   236. Finally, Uganda asserts that the DRC neither specified precisely
the wrongful acts for which it seeks to hold Uganda internationally
responsible nor did it demonstrate that “it suffered direct injury as a
result of acts which it seeks to impute to Uganda”. In this regard Uganda
refers to the Porter Commission, which, according to Uganda, concluded
that “the overwhelming majority, if not all, of the allegations concerning
the exploitation of the DRC’s forest and agricultural resources by Uganda
or by Ugandan soldiers”, were not proven ; that several allegations of
looting were also unfounded; and that Uganda “had at no time intended
to exploit the natural resources of the DRC or to use those resources to
‘finance the war’ and that it did not do so”.

FINDINGS OF THE COURT CONCERNING ACTS OF ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF
                       NATURAL RESOURCES

   237. The Court observes that in order to substantiate its allegations
the DRC refers to the United Nations Panel reports and to the Porter
Commission Report. The Court has already expressed its view with
regard to the evidentiary value of the Porter Commission materials in
general (see paragraph 61 above) and considers that both the Porter
Commission Report, as well as the United Nations Panel reports, to the
extent that they have later proved to be probative, furnish sufficient and
convincing evidence for it to determine whether or not Uganda engaged
in acts of looting, plundering and illegal exploitation of the DRC’s natu-
ral resources. Taking this into account, in order to rule on the third sub-
mission of the DRC, the Court will draw its conclusions on the basis of
the evidence it finds reliable.
   In reaching its decision on the DRC’s claim, it is not necessary for the
Court to make findings of fact with regard to each individual incident
alleged.
   238. According to the Porter Commission Report, the written message
sent by General Kazini in response to the radio message broadcast by the
Ugandan President in December 1998 demonstrated that the General
was aware of problems of conduct of some UPDF officers, that he did
not take any “real action until the matter became public” and that he did



the specific situation of looting, pillage and exploitation of certain natu-
ral resources by members of the army of a State militarily intervening in
another State, which is the subject-matter of the DRC’s third submission.
The Court does not believe that this principle is applicable to this type of
situation.

   245. As the Court has already stated (see paragraph 180 above), the
acts and omissions of members of Uganda’s military forces in the DRC
engage Uganda’s international responsibility in all circumstances, whether
it was an occupying Power in particular regions or not. Thus, whenever
members of the UPDF were involved in the looting, plundering and
exploitation of natural resources in the territory of the DRC, they acted
in violation of the jus in bello, which prohibits the commission of such
acts by a foreign army in the territory where it is present. The Court
notes in this regard that both Article 47 of the Hague Regulations of
1907 and Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibit
pillage.
   The Court further observes that both the DRC and Uganda are parties
to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights of 27 June 1981,
which in paragraph 2 of Article 21, states that “[i]n case of spoliation
the dispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its
property as well as to an adequate compensation”.
   246. The Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to support the
DRC’s claim that Uganda violated its duty of vigilance by not taking
adequate measures to ensure that its military forces did not engage in the
looting, plundering and exploitation of the DRC’s natural resources. As
already noted, it is apparent that, despite instructions from the Ugandan
President to ensure that such misconduct by UPDF troops cease, and
despite assurances from General Kazini that he would take matters in
hand, no action was taken by General Kazini and no verification was
made by the Ugandan Government that orders were being followed up
(see paragraphs 238-239 above). In particular the Court observes that the
Porter Commission stated in its Report that

      “[t]he picture that emerges is that of a deliberate and persistent
      indiscipline by commanders in the field, tolerated, even encouraged
      and covered by General Kazini, as shown by the incompetence or
      total lack of inquiry and failure to deal effectively with breaches of
      discipline at senior levels”.
(Also of relevance in the Porter Commission Report are paragraphs 13.1
“UPDF Officers conducting business”, 13.5 “Smuggling” and 14.5 “Alle-
gations against General Kazini”). It follows that by this failure to act
Uganda violated its international obligations, thereby incurring its inter-
national responsibility. In any event, whatever measures had been taken
by its authorities, Uganda’s responsibility was nonetheless engaged by
the fact that the unlawful acts had been committed by members of its




armed forces (see paragraph 214 above).

  247. As for the claim that Uganda also failed to prevent the looting,
plundering and illegal exploitation of the DRC’s natural resources by
rebel groups, the Court has already found that the latter were not under
the control of Uganda (see paragraph 160 above). Thus, with regard to
the illegal activities of such groups outside of Ituri, it cannot conclude
that Uganda was in breach of its duty of vigilance.

   248. The Court further observes that the fact that Uganda was the
occupying Power in Ituri district (see paragraph 178 above) extends
Uganda’s obligation to take appropriate measures to prevent the looting,
plundering and exploitation of natural resources in the occupied territory
to cover private persons in this district and not only members of Ugan-
dan military forces. It is apparent from various findings of the Porter
Commission that rather than preventing the illegal traffic in natural
resources, including diamonds, high-ranking members of the UPDF facili-
tated such activities by commercial entities. In this regard, the Report of
the Commission mentions a company referred to as “Victoria” (see para-
graph 240 above), which operated, inter alia, in Bunia. In particular the
Report indicates that “General Kazini gave specific instructions to UPDF
Commanders in Isiro, Bunia, Beni, Bumba, Bondo and Buta to allow
the Company to do business uninterrupted in the areas under their
command”. (Also of relevance in the Report of the Commission are
paragraphs 18.5.1 “Victoria Group”, 20.3 “General James Kazini” and
21.3 “The Diamond Link”.)


  249. Thus the Court finds that it has been proven that Uganda has
not complied with its obligations as an occupying Power in Ituri district.
The Court would add that Uganda’s argument that any exploitation
of natural resources in the DRC was carried out for the benefit of
the local population, as permitted under humanitarian law, is not
supported by any reliable evidence.

  250. The Court concludes that it is in possession of sufficient credible
evidence to find that Uganda is internationally responsible for acts of
looting, plundering and exploitation of the DRC’s natural resources
committed by members of the UPDF in the territory of the DRC, for
violating its obligation of vigilance in regard to these acts and for failing
to comply with its obligations under Article 43 of the Hague Regulations
of 1907 as an occupying Power in Ituri in respect of all acts of looting,
plundering and exploitation of natural resources in the occupied terri-
tory.

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS BY
                           UGANDA

   251. The Court, having established that Uganda committed interna-
tionally wrongful acts entailing its international responsibility (see para-
graphs 165, 220 and 250 above), turns now to the determination of the
legal consequences which such responsibility involves.
   252. In its fourth submission the DRC requests the Court to adjudge
and declare :
         “4. (a) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ;
       (b) that the Republic of Uganda shall cease forthwith all continu-
            ing internationally wrongful acts, and in particular its support
            for irregular forces operating in the DRC and its exploitation
            of Congolese wealth and natural resources ;

       (c) that the Republic of Uganda shall provide specific guarantees
           and assurances that it will not repeat the wrongful acts com-
           plained of ;
       (d) that the Republic of Uganda is under an obligation to the
           Democratic Republic of the Congo to make reparation for all
           injury caused to the latter by the violation of the obligations
           imposed by international law and set out in submissions 1, 2
           and 3 above ;
       (e) that the nature, form and amount of the reparation shall be
           determined by the Court, failing agreement thereon between
           the Parties, and that the Court shall reserve the subsequent pro-
           cedure for that purpose.”
   253. The DRC claims that, as the first legal consequence of the estab-
lishment of Uganda’s international responsibility, the latter is under an
obligation to cease forthwith all continuing internationally wrongful acts.
According to the DRC’s Memorial, this obligation of cessation covers, in
particular, the occupation of Congolese territory, the support for irregu-
lar forces operating in the DRC, the unlawful detention of Congolese
nationals and the exploitation of Congolese wealth and natural resources.
In its Reply the DRC refers to the occupation of Congolese territory, the
support for irregular forces operating in the DRC and the exploitation of
Congolese wealth and natural resources. In its final submission presented
at the end of the oral proceedings, the DRC, in view of the withdrawal of
Ugandan troops from the territory of the DRC, asks that Uganda cease
from providing support for irregular forces operating in the DRC and
cease from exploiting Congolese wealth and natural resources.


                                      *
     254. In answer to the question by Judge Vereshchetin (see para-




graph 22 above), the DRC explained that, while its claims relating to the
occupation of the territory of the DRC covered the period from 6 August
1998 to 2 June 2003, other claims including those of new military actions,
new acts of support to irregular forces, as well as continuing illegal
exploitation of natural resources, covered the period from 2 August 1998
until the end of the oral proceedings. The Court notes, however, that it
has not been presented with evidence to support allegations with regard
to the period after 2 June 2003.

   In particular, the Court observes that there is no evidence in the case
file which can corroborate the DRC’s allegation that at present Uganda
supports irregular forces operating in the DRC and continues to be
involved in the exploitation of Congolese natural resources. Thus, the
Court does not find it established that Uganda, following the withdrawal
of its troops from the territory of the DRC in June 2003, continues to
commit the internationally wrongful acts specified by the DRC. The
Court thus concludes that the DRC’s request that Uganda be called upon
to cease the acts referred to in its submission 4 (b) cannot be upheld.


                                   *       *

   255. The DRC further requests the Court to rule that Uganda provide
specific guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of the wrongful acts
complained of. The DRC claims that this request is justified by “the
threats which accompanied the troop withdrawal in May 2003”. In this
regard it alleges that in April 2003 Mr. James Wapakhabulo, the then
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, made a statement “according to
which ‘the withdrawal of our troops from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo does not mean that we will not return there to defend our
security !’ ”. As to the form of the guarantees and assurances of non-
repetition, the DRC, referring to existing international practice, requests
from Uganda “a solemn declaration that it will in future refrain from
pursuing a policy that violates the sovereignty of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the rights of its population” ; in addition,
it “demands that specific instructions to that effect be given by the
Ugandan authorities to their agents”.

                                       *

  256. In this respect the Court has taken judicial notice of the Tripartite
Agreement on Regional Security in the Great Lakes, signed on 26 Octo-
ber 2004 by the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. In the Preamble of this
Agreement the Parties emphasize “the need to ensure that the principles
of good neighbourliness, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states are
