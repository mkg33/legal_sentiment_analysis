                       1. With regard to Colombia’s third counter-claim relating to the arti-
                    sanal fishing rights of the inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago, I
                    agree with the Court’s conclusion that Colombia fails to prove the exis-
                    tence of its traditional practice of artisanal fishing that extends to the area
                    that falls within Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone. In regard to tradi-
                    tional or historic fishing rights, however, I wish to make a few observa-
                    tions in this declaration.

                       2. First of all, traditional fishing rights are recognized and protected
                    under customary international law. Under the law of the sea, traditional
                    fishing generally refers to artisanal fishing that may have existed for cen-
                    turies. Although there may be improvements in the techniques of naviga-
                    tion and communication or in the techniques of fishing, traditional fishing
                    is distinct from habitual fishing and traditional industrial fishing. Tradi-
                    tional fishing rights are acquired from a long process of historical con-
                    solidation of socio-­  economic conditions and conduct, which reflects
                    certain cultural patterns, local customs and traditions. Given their nature,
                    substance and origin, the existence of traditional fishing rights must be
                    examined and determined on a case-by-case basis.

                       3. At the Second United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
                    when the breadth of the territorial sea was being considered, fishery limits
                    was one of the issues raised by States, as expansion of the breadth of the
                    territorial sea from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles would inevitably
                    have a bearing on the fishing interests of States in coastal waters. It was
                    realized, nevertheless, that there were diverse situations in different parts
                    of the world and that it was impossible to take account of every special
                    case (Eighth Meeting of the Committee of the Whole, 30 March 1960,
                    UN doc. A/CONF.19/C.1/SR.8, paras. 6-12 (Brazil); Fifteenth Meeting of
                    the Committee of the Whole, 5 April 1960, UN doc. A/CONF.19/C.1/

                    the Whole, 7 April 1960, UN doc. A/CONF.19/C.1/SR.19, paras. 34-36
                    (Lebanon)). Meanwhile the idea to set up an exclusive fishing zone, sepa-
                    rate but adjacent to the territorial sea, to give the coastal State certain
                    rights in respect of the exploitation of fishery resources in the zone so as
                    to satisfy the growing needs of its people was gaining wide recognition,
                    particularly among the developing countries (Eighth Meeting of the Com‑
                    mittee of the Whole, 30 March 1960, UN doc. A/CONF.19/C.1/SR.8,

                      4. At the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
                    States held divergent views as to whether a coastal State should enjoy
                    exclusive rights to exploit living resources in the exclusive economic zone
                    and to what extent traditional fishing may be maintained. In this regard,
                    both traditional artisanal fishing and long-­established industrial and com-
                    mercial fishing were mentioned.

                       5. In the present case, examples cited by Nicaragua, which refer to the
                    positions taken by States such as Japan, the Soviet Union, Australia,
                    New Zealand and the United States, on the protection of traditional fish-
                    ing rights, largely concern the long-­established industrial and commercial
                    fishing. Contrary to Nicaragua’s assertion that the developing countries
                    “strenuously objected” to the protection of traditional fishing rights,
                    these countries were actually very critical of foreign industrial and com-
                    mercial fishing practices, particularly of those “prescriptive rights”
                    acquired under colonialism (Summary Records of Plenary Meetings,
                    23rd plenary meeting, 1 July 1974, UN doc. A/CONF.62/SR.23, para. 53
                    (Argentina); Summary Records of Meetings of the Second Committee,
                    22nd meeting, 31 July 1974, UN doc. A/CONF.62/C.2/SR.22, para. 72
                    (Zaire); Summary Records of Meetings of the Second Committee,
                    29th meeting, 6 August 1974, UN doc. A/CONF.62/C.2/SR.29, para. 3
                    (Burma)). They were mainly concerned about “leav[ing] the door open
                    for the traditional distant-water fishing nations which had enjoyed and
                    sometimes abused the freedom of fishing in a region with which they had
                    no geographical or economic connexion” (Summary Records of Meetings
                    of the Second Committee, 22nd meeting, 31 July 1974, UN doc. A/
                    CONF.62/C.2/SR.22, para. 92 (Barbados) (emphasis added)). At the
                    same time, they were sympathetic to the fishing interests of the developing
                    countries whose economy depended on fisheries. In “Conclusions in the
                    General Report of the African States Regional Seminar on the Law of the
                    Sea”, a document to which Nicaragua refers in support of its claim, it is
                    stated that “the ‘historic rights’ acquired by certain neighbouring Afri-
                    can States in a part of the Sea which may fall within the exclusive jurisdic-
                    tion of another State w[]ould be recognized and safeguarded” (Report of
                    the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor
                    beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction (1972), UN doc. A/8721,
                    Annex I, p. 75). Apparently, traditional fishing rights have to be consid-
                    ered in each specific context.




                      6. The establishment of the exclusive economic zone régime is one of
                    the major achievements of the Third United Nations Conference on the





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 282                                                                              10/09/23 09:40

                    406 	     sovereign rights and maritime spaces (decl. xue)

                    Law of the Sea, which largely responds to the general concerns of the
                    coastal States over the exploitation of living resources by industrial and
                    commercial fishing of foreign fleets in their coastal waters and the need to
                    ensure optimum utilization of natural resources of the sea. Under Part V
                    of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter
                    “UNCLOS”), the coastal State is entitled to establish a 200‑nautical-mile
                    exclusive economic zone beyond and adjacent to its territorial sea. It
                    enjoys sovereign rights in the exploration, exploitation, conservation and
                    management of the natural resources in the exclusive economic zone and
                    has the jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial
                    islands, marine scientific research as well as the protection and preserva-
                    tion of the marine environment in that zone. It shall determine the allow-
                    able catch of the living resources and take conservation and management
                    measures to ensure sustainable development and utilization of the living
                    resources in the exclusive economic zone. This new régime has fundamen-
                    tally changed the fishery limits in the sea and put an end to the freedom
                    of fishing in the areas that fall within the exclusive economic zone of the
                    coastal States.

                       7. Article 51, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS explicitly recognizes the tradi-
                    tional fishing rights of the immediately adjacent neighbouring States in
                    the archipelagic waters. According to Nicaragua, this provision is the
                    only exception, as a carve-out, that preserves traditional fishing rights
                    under UNCLOS. The drafting history of Part IV on archipelagic States,
                    however, does not support that interpretation. The travaux préparatoires
                    show that Article 51, paragraph 1, is the outcome of the negotiations of
                    States on the recognition of the status of archipelagic States. It was
                    intended to maintain a balance of rights and interests between the archi-
                    pelagic States and their regional neighbours whose fishing interests would
                    be substantially jeopardized by the enclosure of the archipelagic waters
                    (see Summary Records of Meetings of the Second Committee, 36th meet‑
                    ing, 12 August 1974, UN doc. A/CONF.62/C.2/SR.36; Summary Records
                    of Meetings of the Second Committee, 37th meeting, 12 August 1974,
                    UN doc. A/CONF.62/C.2/SR.37, on the positions taken by Singapore,
                    Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Japan). Confined to a special
                    régime, Article 51, paragraph 1, concerns solely traditional fishing rights
                    in the archipelagic waters. There is no legal basis in international law to
                    preclude the existence of traditional fishing rights under other circum-
                    stances.

                       8. Article 62, paragraph 3, of UNCLOS provides a number of relevant
                    factors for giving access to other States to the surplus of the allowable
                    catch in the exclusive economic zone, among which is the need to mini-
                    mize economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually
                    fished in the zone. According to Nicaragua, by taking into account this
                    “habitually fished” factor, the Convention has settled the relationship
                    between the exclusive economic zone and traditional fishing rights; the





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 284                                                                             10/09/23 09:40

                    407 	      sovereign rights and maritime spaces (decl. xue)

                    former thereby supersedes the latter. This conclusion is apparently over-­
                    sweeping. Among all relevant factors, Article 62, paragraph 3, highlights
                    five factors for consideration, namely national interests of the coastal
                    State, rights of land-­ locked States and geographically disadvantaged
                    States, the requirements of developing States in the subregion or region,
                    and the need to minimize economic dislocation in States whose foreign
                    nationals have habitually fished in the zone or which have made substan-
                    tial efforts in research and identification of stocks. Those factors reflect
                    the principles of distributive justice and fairness that underlie the régime
                    of the exclusive economic zone under UNCLOS. Habitual fishing may
                    include certain types of traditional fishing activities carried out by indi-
                    vidual fishermen of other States, but in the context of the Article, that
                    factor alone cannot be taken to presume that all situations relating to
                    traditional fishing rights are encompassed by that Article.


                       9. The advent of the régime of the exclusive economic zone, as set
                    forth in UNCLOS, does not by itself extinguish traditional fishing rights
                    that may be found to exist under customary international law. According
                    to the settled jurisprudence of the Court, a treaty provision may
                    “embod[y]” or “crystallize[]” a pre-­existing or emergent rule of customary
                    law (Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Judgment,
                    I.C.J. Reports 1982, p. 38, para. 24), or may “constitute[] the foundation
                    of, or has generated a rule which . . . has since passed into the general
                    corpus of international law” (North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Repub‑
                    lic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands),
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 41, para. 71). For pre‑existing rights
                    under customary international law, however, unless and until they are
                    explicitly negated by treaty law or new customary rules, they continue to
                    exist and apply under customary international law, even as regards States
                    that are parties to the relevant treaty (see Military and Paramilitary Activ‑
                    ities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America),
                    Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 424,
                    para. 73). The Court has also held that where the content of a customary
                    rule is “confirmed and influenced by [a treaty referring to and embodying
                    this rule]”, the fact that the treaty “does not go on to regulate directly all
                    aspects of [the] content” of the rule in question,
                          “demonstrates that . . . customary international law continues to exist
                          alongside treaty law. The areas governed by these two sources of law
                          thus do not overlap exactly, and the rules do not have the same con-
                          tent.” (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
                          (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J.
                          Reports 1986, p. 94, para. 176.)

                      10. The existence of traditional fishing rights must be proved by evi-
                    dence. As noted, such rights are derived from long, continuous and peace-





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 286                                                                               10/09/23 09:40

                    408 	     sovereign rights and maritime spaces (decl. xue)

                    ful exercise of certain practices. In the absence of specific conventional
                    provisions that expressly negate all traditional fishing rights, general
                    international law will continue to govern on the matter, whenever a case
                    arises. As the Preamble of UNCLOS affirms, “matters not regulated by
                    this Convention continue to be governed by the rules and principles of
                    general international law”.

                       11. Indeed, States party to UNCLOS continue to recognize, through
                    bilateral agreements, historic and traditional fishing rights that existed
                    prior to the conclusion of the Convention. For example, in 1974, India
                    and Sri Lanka agreed on the delimitation of historic waters of Palk Bay,
                    where the traditional fishing rights of both States’ fishermen are recog-
                    nized and protected. Article 6 of the Agreement provides that “[t]he ves-
                    sels of Sri Lanka and India will enjoy in each other’s waters such rights as
                    they have traditionally enjoyed therein” (Agreement between Sri Lanka
                    India and on the Boundary in Historic Waters between the Two Coun-
                    tries and Related Matters, 26 and 28 June 1974, United Nations, Treaty
                    Series (UNTS), Vol. 1049, p. 26). Likewise, the 1978 boundary agree-
                    ment between Australia and Papua New Guinea acknowledges and pro-
                    tects the “traditional way of life and livelihood” of the local population,
                    including traditional fishing, in the Protected Zone established (Arti-
                    cle 10 (3) of the 1978 Treaty between Australia and the Independent State
                    of Papua New Guinea concerning Sovereignty and Maritime Boundaries
                    in the Area between the Two Countries, including the Area Known as
                    Torres Strait, and Related Matters, UNTS, Vol. 1429, p. 215).

                        12. Traditional fishing rights are also recognized in international juris-
                    prudence. For instance, in the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab
                    Jamahiriya) case, Tunisia claimed that it had had historic rights over sed-
                    entary and other fisheries in a certain zone since time immemorial,
                    “deriv[ing] from the long-­    established interests and activities of its
                    ­population in exploiting the fisheries of the bed and waters of the Medi-
                     terranean off its coasts” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1982, p. 72, para. 98).
                     Although the Court did not find it necessary to address Tunisia’s claim, it
                     clearly acknowledged that such rights exist under customary international
                     law, notwithstanding the exclusive economic zone régime (ibid., p. 74,
                     para. 100).

                       13. In the Eritrea/Yemen arbitration, the issue was squarely addressed
                    by the tribunal. It explicitly recognized the existence of traditional fishing
                    rights of Eritrea’s fishermen both within and beyond the territorial sea
                    around the Yemeni islands (Award of the Arbitral Tribunal in the first

                    reaching its conclusion regarding traditional fishing rights, the tribunal
                    emphasized that “[i]n finding that the Parties each have sovereignty over
                    various of the Islands the Tribunal stresses to them that such sovereignty
                    is not inimical to, but rather entails, the perpetuation of the traditional
                    fishing regime in the region” (Award of the Arbitral Tribunal in the first
                    stage of the proceedings between Eritrea and Yemen (Territorial Sover‑
                    eignty and Scope of the Dispute) Decision of 9 October 1998, RIAA,
                    Vol. XXII, pp. 329‑330, para. 526). On the relationship between the tra-
                    ditional fishing régime and UNCLOS, the arbitral tribunal observed:


                             “By its very nature, [this traditional fishing régime] is not qualified
                          by the maritime zones specified under the United Nations Convention
                          on the Law of the Sea . . . The traditional fishing regime operates
                          throughout those waters beyond the territorial waters of each of the
                          Parties, and also in their territorial waters and ports . . . Accordingly,
                          it does not depend, either for its existence or for its protection, upon
                          the drawing of an international boundary by this Tribunal.” (Award
                          of the Arbitral Tribunal in the second stage of the proceedings between

                          1999, RIAA, Vol. XXII, p. 361, paras. 109‑110.)

                       14. The findings in Eritrea/Yemen were cited by the arbitral tribunal in
                    the Abyei arbitration concerning the delimitation of land boundaries in
                    the Abyei area between Sudan and South Sudan. That tribunal concluded
                    that, according to general principles of law, “traditional rights, in the
                    absence of an explicit agreement to the contrary, have usually been
                    deemed to remain unaffected by any territorial delimitation” (Award in
                    the Arbitration regarding the Delimitation of the Abyei Area between the
                    Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army,
                    Award of 22 July 2009, RIAA, Vol. XXX, pp. 408‑410 and 412,
                    paras. 753‑760 and 766).
                       15. In the present case, Nicaragua refers to the case concerning Delim‑
                    itation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/
                    United States of America) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 246) in sup-
                    port of its claim that traditional fishing rights have been extinguished by
                    the establishment of the exclusive economic zone and that the coastal
                    States now enjoy a “legal monopoly” over the living resources of the
                    exclusive economic zone. This is a far-­fetched claim. In the Gulf of Maine
                    case, first of all, the dispute between the parties did not concern tradi-
                    tional fishing rights. The United States claimed a certain “predominance”
                    of its fishing activities in the relevant area, which related to established
                    industrial and commercial fishing. Secondly, the United States invoked its
                    preferential situation as a relevant circumstance for the purpose of equi-
                    table delimitation, which was rejected by the Chamber of the Court. Nei-

                    ther in law nor in fact is this case relevant to the issue of traditional
                    fishing rights.

                        16. Two principal elements have been mentioned in jurisprudence for
                    the establishment of traditional fishing rights: first, traditional fishing
                    rights had to be borne out by “artisanal fishing”, and secondly, such
                    ­fishing activities continued consistently for a lengthy period of time (see
                     Award of the Arbitral Tribunal in the second stage of the proceedings
                     between Eritrea and Yemen (Maritime Delimitation), Decision of
                     17 December 1999, RIAA, Vol. XXII, Vol. XXII, p. 359, para. 103; Award
                     of the Arbitral Tribunal in the first stage of the proceedings between Eritrea
                     and Yemen (Territorial Sovereignty and Scope of the Dispute), Decision of
                     9 October 1998, RIAA, Vol. XXII, pp. 244‑245, para. 129). As the Eritrea/
                     Yemen tribunal stated, at the core of the traditional fishing activities is
                     “the presence of deeply-­rooted common patterns of behavior”, which is
                     often linked with local traditions and customs that continued consistently
                     for a long time (ibid., p. 244, para. 129). The first element is applied pri-
                     marily to distinguish traditional fishing from industrial fishing, while the
                     second element has to be assessed under the circumstances of each case.
                     In principle, the duration of the fishing activities cannot be measured by
                     a fixed number of years, but it has to be sufficiently long to reflect the
                     existence of such tradition and culture. In this regard, certain flexibility
                     with regard to the types of evidence and duration of time may be called
                     for. In the present case, although the evidence adduced by Colombia is
                     not considered sufficient to prove its claim, the statements of the Nicara-
                     guan President do not deny the existence of traditional fishing of the
                     inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago, particularly of the Raizales.
                     In order to preserve the local tradition and custom of the San Andres
                     Archipelago, an agreement on fisheries for the benefit of the Raizales
                     community between the Parties, in my view, would contribute to a stable
                     and co-­operative relationship in the region.
