Although I agree with the above Judgment as a whole, I wish to make
my position clear in regard not only to certain points with which I fully
agree but also to some reservations which I have as to the reasoning and
the ultimate findings.

Due, on the one hand, to the substantial similarity and, in more than
one issue, identical nature of the arguments forwarded by the respondent
States and, on the other, to the lack of time to do proper justice to the
cases, the text of my opinion is designed to cover mutatis mutandis all
eight cases.

I. Locus STANDI IN JUDICIO OF SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO

1. Locus standi and Its Relationship to Jurisdiction ratione personae

1. In its original meaning’, the expression “locus standi in judicio”
implies the right of a person to appear or to be heard in such-and-such
proceedings (Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed, Vol. 2, p. 1115),
or, as regards the present Court, the right of a person lato sensu to
appear or to be heard in proceedings before the Court.

The right to appear before the International Court of Justice, due to
the fact that it is not a fully open court of law, is a limited right. The
limitations exist in two respects. Primo, the right is reserved for States
(Statute, Art. 34, para. 1). Consequently, it does not belong to other
juridical persons or physical persons. Secundo, as far as States are con-
cerned, only States parties to the Statute of the Court possess the right
referred to, being as Members of the United Nations ipso facto parties
to the Statute of the Court or by accepting conditions pursuant to
Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute. States non-parties to the Statute
can acquire this right on condition that they accept the general jurisdiction
of the Court in conformity with Security Council resolution 9 (1946).

From the substantive point of view, this right is a personal privilege
(privilegia favorabile) of the State which, by accepting the Statute of the
Court, has recognized the Court as a judicial body equipped with jus
dicere. It is the consequence of the burden — or privilegia odiosa — con-
sisting in fulfilment of the conditions prescribed.

! Even in the jurisprudence of the Court the expression is sometimes used as a descrip-
tive one. Exempli causa, in the case concerning Barcelona Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited, the Court used it to denote right of “a government to protect the
interests of shareholders as such” which was in effect the matter of legal interest inde-
pendent of the right of Belgium to appear before the Court (Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, LC.J. Reports 1964, p. 45). On the contrary, in the South West Africa cases the
Court has drawn a clear distinction between “standing before the Court itself”, i.e., locus
standi, and “standing in the ... phase of ... proceedings (South West Africa, Second
Phase, I.C.J. Reports 1966, p. 18, para. 4).



Locus standi before the Court cannot, however, be taken as synony-
mous to the jurisdiction of the Court. It is, by its nature, a preliminary
condition or presumption for the jurisdiction of the Court or its compe-
tence. In this sense it is appropriate to speak about general jurisdiction
and special jurisdiction or competence of the Court. By possessing locus
standi a State automatically recognizes general jurisdiction of the Court.

In order to be able to speak about special jurisdiction or competence in
casu, however, it is necessary that, besides the right to appear before the
Court, there should exist a specific basis of jurisdiction. And it is on these
grounds that States submit a concrete dispute or type of disputes to the
Court for solution.

In other words, having in mind the fact that the Court is not only a
court of law whose jurisdiction is of an optional nature, but, at the same
time, a partly open court, it can be said that double consent of States is
necessary in order for the Court to establish its competence in casu:

(i) consent that the Court is “an organ instituted for the purpose of jus
dicere” (dissenting opinion by Dr. Daxner, Corfu Channel, LC.J.
Reports 1948, p. 39). This consent is expressed indirectly, by joining
the membership of the United Nations, or directly, by a non-
Member of the United Nations either by adhering to the Statute of
the Court or by accepting the general jurisdiction of the Court in
conformity with Security Council resolution 9 (1946) as a prelimi-
nary condition, and

(ii) consent that the Court is competent to deal with the particular
dispute or type of disputes, which is made through relevant juris-
dictional bases within Article 36 of the Statute as a substantive
but qualified condition?.

2. The notions locus standi in judicio and jurisdiction ratione personae
cannot, despite certain extrinsic similarities, be taken as synonymous.

The element shared in common by these two notions is that they rep-
resent processual conditions on whose existence is dependent the validity

2 As stated by the Court “under the system of the Statute the seising of the Court by
means of an Application is not ipso facto open to all States parties to the Statute, it is only
open to the extent defined in the applicable Declarations” (Nottebohm, Preliminary
Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122). It should be noted also that the Court
in the Legality of the Use of Force case found

“[w]hereas the Court, under its Statute, does not automatically have jurisdiction over
legal disputes between States parties to that Statute or between other States to whom
access to the Court has been granted . . . whereas the Court can therefore exercise
jurisdiction only between States parties to a dispute who not only have access to the
Court but also have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court, either in general form or
for the individual dispute concerned” (Provisional Measures, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I),
p. 488, para. 19; emphasis added).



of the actual proceedings before the Court; both with respect to inci-
dental proceedings and the merits, and with respect to the bringing of
the dispute to the Court’s decisions in the proceedings. And there the
common ground between the two notions essentially ends and room
for differences emerges.

The difference between the two is, first of all, of a conceptual nature.
Locus standi is a condition which has to do with parties, whereas jurisdic-
tion ratione personae — as an element of the jurisdiction of the Court —
is a condition which has to do with the Court itself. Also, the question of
locus standi as of antecedent nature is a pre-preliminary question which
“should be taken in advance of any question of competence” (Northern
Cameroons, 1.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 105, separate opinion of Sir Gerald
Fitzmaurice ; emphasis in the original), whereas jurisdiction ratione per-
sonae is a question of competence, or special jurisdiction of the Court
stricto sensu. Furthermore, a lack of locus standi cannot, as a rule, be
overcome in the proceedings while a lack of jurisdiction ratione personae
is surmountable since the parties may confer jurisdiction upon the Court
in the course of the proceedings or perfect it (for instance, by expressing
agreement or by forum prorogatum). The difference derives from the fact
that jurisdiction is governed by the law in force between the parties, while
locus standi is governed by objective rules of the Statute having a consti-
tutional nature.

The seemingly identical nature of these two notions is, apparently,
mostly due to a tacit equalization of the processual contact between the
Court and the parties to the dispute — and of the litigious relationship.
As there are no separate, preliminary proceedings for establishing the
existence of processual conditions for the validity of the proceedings
(except the administrative action of the Registry in the case of applica-
tions submitted by non-State subjects), the existence of processual con-
ditions is established during the actual proceedings whose validity depends
on the existence of these conditions. This takes place more often than not
during the proceedings on preliminary objections which is why the rare
cases of locus standi are subsumed under jurisdiction ratione personae.

2. Issue of United Nations Membership and locus standi of Serbia and
Montenegro

3. The locus standi of Serbia and Montenegro in the present proceed-
ings before the Court is closely, and, I would say, organically, linked with
its membership in the United Nations, due to the fact that Serbia and
Montenegro could not be considered as being party to the Statute apart
from being a Member State of the United Nations as well as the fact that
its locus standi cannot be based on conditions set forth in Article 35, para-
graph 2, of the Statute of the Court.

4. In normal circumstances, the legal consequences of admission of a



State to membership in the United Nations are clear and do not require
special elaboration. At the moment of its admission to membership a
State becomes a bearer of the rights and obligations stipulated in the
United Nations Charter, among which of particular relevance in the
matter at hand is the status of a party to the Statute of the Court. How-
ever, the circumstances surrounding the case at hand could hardly be
termed normal. More precisely, the Applicant, Serbia and Montenegro,
was admitted to membership in the Organization on the basis of the
proper procedure. But this was done without its status in the Organization
being previously established in explicit terms either by the political
organs of the United Nations or by the Court.

5. United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/1 is unclear in sub-
stance and contradictory per se. Assessing its substance in the case con-
cerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide ( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Mon-
tenegro) (hereinafter referred to as “Genocide Convention”), the Court
found that “the solution adopted is not free from legal difficulties” (Pro-
visional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993, LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14,
para. 18). The situation was additionally complicated by the subsequent
practice of the United Nations organs “characterized by pragmatism and
flexibility rather than a strict adherence to the procedures” prescribed by
the Charter (Contributor (Christian Tams) on Article 6 (margin note 25)
in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations, A Commentary,
2nd ed., Vol. I, 2002, pp. 213-214). In 1993 Professor Rosalyn Higgins
wrote that “[t]he outcome has been anomalous in the extreme” (R. Hig-
gins, “The New United Nations and Former Yugoslavia”, International
Affairs, Vol. 69, No. 3 (July 1993), p. 479). It can, therefore, be con-
cluded that, until the admission of Serbia and Montenegro to member-
ship in the Organization on 1 November 2000, the political organs of the
United Nations had not determined the status of Serbia and Montenegro
in the United Nations in a clear and unequivocal manner.

6. From 1993 onwards the Court was faced with the question of
Serbia and Montenegro’s membership in the United Nations a number of
times. The relevant findings of the Court relating to this particular ques-
tion can, generally, be divided into: primo, findings of the Court which,
by their formal, extrinsic characteristics, could be qualified as “avoiding
positions” and, secundo, the obiter dicta of the Court which contain cer-
tain elements or indications of a substantive approach to the matter at
hand.

(a) Findings of the Court based on “avoiding position”

7. In its Order of 2 June 1999 the Court stated that it “need not con-
sider this question for the purpose of deciding whether or not it can indi-
cate provisional measures in the present case” (I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I),
p. 136, para. 33). What we have here is a slightly modified formulation



expressing “avoiding position” of the Court with regard to the question
of “whether or not Yugoslavia is a Member of the United Nations, and as
such a party to the Statute of the Court” (Application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro) ), Provisional Meas-
ures, Order of 8 April 1993, LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 18) which
the Court used several times in the disputes to which Serbia and Mon-
tenegro is a party in the proceedings before the Court. The correctly inter-
preted formulation, regardless of modification in the specific cases, sug-
gests the conclusion that the Court reserved the right to state its definitive
position on the relevant question in the later phases of the proceedings.

It is easy to conclude that such a finding of the Court represents a
delay of the answer to the question “whether or not Yugoslavia is a
Member of the United Nations, and as such a party to the Statute of the
Court” (ibid. ). However, the question appears which are, in the circum-
stances of the case, the intrinsic meanings of the delay.

8. On the basis of the Application of the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia (hereinafter referred to as the “FRY”) filed in the Registry of the
Court on 29 April 1999, the Court was seised and on the basis of a
request for the indication of provisional measures the Court instituted
the proper proceedings. Was the Court, in the light of the relevant pro-
visions of the Statute, in a position to be seised ? Furthermore, was it in a

10. Judicial presumption, along with legal presumption? is one of the

3 In the Order of 30 June 1999 the Court noted Belgium requested

“that the question of the jurisdiction of the Court and of the admissibility of the
Application in this case should be separately determined before any proceedings on
the merits” (Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v. Belgium), Order of 30 June
1999, LC.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 989).

For,

“the fact that the various provisions regulating the incidental jurisdiction are included
in the Statute . . . serves to supply a general consensual basis, through a State’s being
a party to the Charter and Statute, which are always part of the title of jurisdiction
and always confer rights and impose obligations on its parties in relation to the Court
and it’s activities. But if it is obvious that the Court lacks all jurisdiction to deal with
the case on the merits, then it automatically follows that it will lack all incidental
Jurisdiction whatsoever.” (Shabtai Rosenne, The Law and Practice of the Interna-
tional Court 1920-1996, Vol. II, 1997, pp. 598-599; emphasis added.)

4 Better known than judicial presumptions, legal presumptions (praesumptio juris) are
widely applied in international law. International tribunals are used to resort to proof by
inferences of fact (présomption de fait) or circumstantial evidence (Corfu Channel, Mer-
its, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1949, p. 18). For legal presumption in the practice of the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, see T. Buergenthal, R. Norris and D. Shelton,
Protecting Human Rights in the Americas, Selected Problems, 2nd ed., 1986, pp. 130-132
and pp. 139-144. The practice of international courts abounds in presumptions based on
general principles of international law, whether positive as presumption of good faith
(exempli causa, Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions, Judgment No. 5, 1925, P.C.LJ,
Series A, No. 5, p. 43) or negative as presumption of abuse of right (Certain German
Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Merits, Judgment No. 7, 1926, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 7,
p. 30; Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Second Phase, 1930, P.C.LJ.,
Series A, No. 24, p. 12; Corfu Channel, Merits, Judgment, 1949, LC.J. Reports 1949,
p. 119, dissenting opinion of Judge Ecer). The special weight they possess in the interpre-
tation of treaties since the function of interpretation of treaties is to discover “what was,
or what may reasonably be presumed to have been, the intention of the parties to a treaty
when they concluded it” (Harvard Law School, Research in International Law, Part ITI,
Law of Treaties, Art. 19, p. 940; emphasis added).



main sorts of presumption in international law. It means that a certain

16. It appears that a distinction has to be made between an “effective
seisin” and a “valid seisin” of the Court.

Effective seisin of the Court is, as a rule, based on prima facie appre-
ciation of the right of the party or parties to appear before the Court.

The prima facie appreciation of the right of the party or parties to
appear before the Court, in contrast to the appreciation of the basis of
jurisdiction, seems to be relaxed due primarily to the fact that today
almost all States are Members of the United Nations. Accordingly, it
appears that in the practice of the Court it is assumed that the fulfilment
of the conditions specified in Article 38, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and
Article 39, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Rules of Court enables effective
seisin of the Court.

The effective seisin is, in the absence of separate proceedings designed
to deal with conditions for the validity of the proceedings, including the
question of locus standi, before the very institution of a proceeding, a



necessary procedural step enabling the Court to deal, inter alia, with the
validity of its seisin.

In contrast, valid seisin in regard to the question of locus standi means
that it is conclusively established by the Court that parties to a dispute
have fulfilled the necessary precondition to be entitled to appear before
the Court, i.e., that they have recognized in the proper way — by being a
party to the Statute of the Court or by the declaration pursuant to resolu-
tion 9 (1946) of the Security Council — the general jurisdiction of the
Court. It is that relevant point in time in which parties to a dispute
become parties to the dispute before the Court.

In that regard, the relationship between effective seisin and valid seisin
could be compared with the relationship between the so-called prima
facie jurisdiction and jurisdiction considered as conclusively established.

Accordingly, if the expression “effective seisin” or “regular seisin” is
used to denote validity of the seisin of the Court, it should be understood
as relating to the formal aspect of its validity only, not to the substantive
one.

(d) Obiter dictum containing elements or indications of substantive
approach

17. In the Application for Revision case the Court, considering Gen-
eral Assembly resolution 55/12 of 1 November 2000, points out, inter
alia, that it

“cannot have changed retroactively the sui generis position which
the FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United Nations over the period
1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court
and the Genocide Convention. Furthermore, the letter of the Legal
Counsel of the United Nations dated 8 December 2000 cannot have
affected the FRY’s position in relation to treaties.” (Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 71.)

It is easy to go along with the findings that, as a rule, General Assembly
resolutions, including the resolution in question, do not have retroactive
effect. But this finding of the Court can hardly be said to be very useful.
Because of the object of the exclusion of retroactive effect of General
Assembly resolution 55/12 in the aforementioned obiter — ie. a “sui
generis position which the FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United
Nations over the period 1992 to 2000 . . .” — which is obviously unclear
and vague. In the quoted formulation the phrase “sui generis” is linked
to the substantive “position” which, in this particular context, has a
highly unclear and technical meaning. Has it been used as a synonym or
a substitute for the word “membership” or the term “membership rights
and obligations” or, to express, for that matter, the factual relationship
between the Applicant and the Organization? If it has the meaning of
“sui generis” membership, it is difficult to fathom which elements of



membership from the abstract point of view, or which concrete elements
of presumed membership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, would
provide the basis of the qualification that what is involved here is “sui
generis” membership? Namely, it is worth noting that the United Nations
Charter makes no mention of “sui generis” membership, obviously a
kind of amalgamation of “membership” and “non-membership”. So, the
terms such as this one represent rather an attempt of sorts to conceptu-
alize something that is non-existent as a notion, and not an appropriate
expression of positive legal substance — the more so, if one has in mind
the absence of a limine or exempli causa elements of “membership” or
non-membership” in the world Organization.

It is true, however, that in paragraph 70 of the Judgment of 3 February
2003 in the Application for Revision case it is stated that

“Resolution 47/1 did not inter alia affect the FRY’s right to
appear before the Court . . . under the conditions laid down by the
Statute. Nor did it affect the position of the FRY in relation to the
Genocide Convention.” (Judgment, LC.J. Reports 2003, p. 31,
para. 70.)

This particular dictum seems to be an assertion rather than a proper legal
reasoning. More specifically, it is unclear what is actually the legal basis,
in the light of the controversy regarding the status of the Applicant in the
United Nations, for “the FRY’s right to appear before the Court”
(ibid. ). Is it based on its being a United Nations Member State which is
ipso facto a party to the Statute of the Court, or under the conditions
specified in Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court and Secu-
rity Council resolution 9 (1946)?

18. It is unclear how the obiter about the “sui generis position” of the
FRY vis-à-vis the United Nations came to find a place in the Court’s
Judgment in the Application for Revision case. In that case the Court was
faced with the issue whether the admission of the FRY to the United
Nations as such is a “new fact” in the sense of Article 61 of the Statute.
The Court itself stressed that:

“In reality, [the FRY] bases its Application for revision on the
legal consequences which it seeks to draw from facts subsequent to
the Judgment which it is asked to have revised. Those consequences,
even supposing them to be established, cannot be regarded as facts
within the meaning of Article 61. The FRY’s argument cannot
accordingly be upheld.” (Application for Revision of the Judgment of
11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections
( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
2003, p. 30, para. 69; emphasis added.)



What is striking is that the Court formulated its obiter after almost ten
years of the “avoiding position” approach to the issue, although the issue
of membership of the FRY in the United Nations was ab initio of fun-
damental importance for the jurisdiction of the Court in all disputes in
which the FRY is involved as a party before the Court. Having that in
mind, it could hardly be objected to by the Court that, throughout that
period, it found it necessary, in any of the proceedings unfolding before it
successively, to make interim determination upon the issue in explicit
terms for the purposes of the pending proceedings. However, the Court
failed to do so until the admission of the FRY to the United Nations,
when the matter was resolved definitely. That comes as a surprise in
itself.

19. The objective meaning of the insistence on the sui generis position
of Serbia and Montenegro vis-a-vis the United Nations in the period
from 1992 to 2000, as considered in paragraph 70 of the Judgment in the
Application for Revision case, amounts in the existing circumstances to
an attempt to revise the decision taken by the main political organs of the
United Nations. Or in terms of legal notions, it amounts to the creation
of a fictio leges.

20. The qualifications of the status of the Applicant in the United
Nations as “sui generis membership”, “de facto working status”, etc., are
deprived of legal substance in terms of the Charter. The Charter of the
United Nations does not recognize such forms of “membership” or “non-
membership” or a mixture thereof. These syntagmas constitute rather an
attempt — based on analogy with membership in terms of the Charter —
of a notional conceptualization of observer status of a non-Member
based on Article 2, paragraph 6, and Article 35, paragraph 2, of the
Charter, or of the status of non-State entities, such as national liberation
movements, or of observer status of regional organizations and groups of
States pursuant to Article 52, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United
Nations. In the qualitative sense, the meaning of the syntagmas such as
“sui generis membership” or “de facto working status” would mean, in
fact, reduced membership rights or the privileged position of some
non-Members.

Such a meaning can hardly be brought in accordance either with the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations which regulate member-
ship rights and obligations, or with the fundamental principle of sover-
eign equality of States enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter
of the United Nations.

The provisions of the Charter, as far as the relationship of the Organi-
zation vis-à-vis States is concerned, have been formulated in terms of the
dichotomy Member States/non-Member States. Tertium quid simply does
not exist. Chapter II of the United Nations Charter (“Membership”)
points out only the division into the original Members of the United



Nations and the subsequently admitted Members of the Organization, a
division which has no substantive meaning in terms of membership rights
and duties, but only that of historical record.

Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, setting out the prin-
ciples on which the Organization and its Members are based and shall
act, provides in paragraph 1 that “[t]he Organization is based on the prin-
ciple of the sovereign equality of all its Members”.

The principle contained in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter con-
stitutes ratione materiae a narrow application of the “basic legal concept
of State sovereignty in customary international law” (Military and Para-
military Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nicaragua v. United States
of America), Merits, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 111, para. 212;
hereinafter referred to as “Nicaragua”), with legal force equal to that of
the principle expressed in paragraph 2 of the same Article determined by
the Court as being “not only a principle of customary international law
but also a fundamental or cardinal principle of such law” (ibid., p. 100,
para. 190).

The principle of the sovereign equality of States as a universal principle
belonging to corpus juris cogentis operates with the United Nations
Charter on two levels:


32. The arguments of the Respondents, specifically elaborated by
France, tended to move in the direction of termination of the proceedings
on the basis of something that might be termed “implicit discontinu-
ance”.

Namely, it was contended that “the Federal Government of Yugosla-
via could . . . have made the choice — the simple, reasonable choice — to
discontinue the proceedings. This was not the case, at least not expli-
citly.” (CR 2004/12, p. 6, paras. 3 and 4; emphasis added.) Commenting
on the Written Observations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
counsel for France finds that “[t]his looks very much like a discontinu-
ance that will not speak its name” (ibid., p. 8, para. 9 [translation by the

Registry]).


Discontinuance, as designed by Articles 88 and 89 of the Rules of
Court, is comprised of two constitutive elements taken cumulatively: the
will of the parties and the proper process.

The will of the parties represents normative substance of discontinu-
ance as designed in Articles 88 and 89 of the Rules, serving as the legal
basis on which the discontinuance may be effected. By way of “the will of
the parties” discontinuance reflects the structural principle of consensual
jurisdiction in contentious cases according to which the Court cannot
discontinue or withdraw a case on behalf of the parties, if the parties do
not wish so. Viewed in that sense, the will of the parties is an overriding
condition for discontinuance within the meaning of Articles 88 and 89
of the Rules.

The modalities of expression of the will differ. In accordance with
Article 88 of the Rules, agreement of the parties is required and, in the
light of Article 89, paragraph 2, the absence of the objection of the respon-
dent which, in fact, constitutes the presumption of acquiescence, is of
relevance.

The proper process aimed at discontinuance implies the actions of the
party (or parties), as well as an order of the Court. The discontinuance
process, in terms of Articles 88 and 89 of the Rules, bears a dual charac-
teristic: primo, in view of substantial meaning of the will of the parties
the order of the Court represents a neutral act of the Court, an act whose
“main object . . . is to provide a procedural facility, or rather . . . to
reduce the process of discontinuance to order” (Barcelona Traction,
Light and Power Company, Limited, Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
L C.J. Reports 1964, p. 19); secundo, Article 88, paragraph 1, of the
Rules provides that “the parties, either jointly or separately, notify the
Court in writing” (emphasis added), while Article 89, paragraph 1, stipu-
lates that “the applicant informs the Court in writing” (emphasis added).
The Court effectuated it through an order with reference to Article 48 of
the Statute and Article 88 or 89 of the Rules respectively.

33. In concreto, the eventual discontinuance would, in the light of the
relevant circumstances of the case, have to be based on the provision
of Article 89, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court which provides as
follows:

“If, at the time when the notice of discontinuance is received, the
respondent has already taken some step in the proceedings, the
Court shall fix a time-limit within which the respondent may state
whether it opposes the discontinuance of the proceedings. If no
objection is made to the discontinuance before the expiration of the
time-limit, acquiescence will be presumed and the Court shall make
an order officially recording the discontinuance of the proceedings
and directing the removal of the case from the list. If objection is
made, the proceedings shall continue.”



However, none of the elements of discontinuance, both those concern-
ing the will of the parties and those concerning the proper process,
embodied in that provision are met.

Serbia and Montenegro, as the Applicant, clearly and unambiguously
expressed the will not to discontinue the proceedings. In his concluding
remarks during the oral hearing, the Agent of Serbia and Montenegro
repeatedly pointed out that the Applicant “did not discontinue the pro-
ceedings” (CR 2004/23, p. 16, para. 21; p. 18, para. 27; p. 20, para. 34).
As such, it is obvious that Serbia and Montenegro could not have
submitted notice of discontinuance to the Court as provided for by
Article 89, paragraph 2, of the Rules. Some respondent States (the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France), true, saw notice of dis-
continuance in the Written Observations of Serbia and Montenegro of
18 December 2002. The Applicant, in its reply to those contentions
contained in a letter dated 28 February 2003 from the Agent of Serbia
and Montenegro, stresses that “the Written Observations of 18 December
2002 do not represent such a notice of discontinuance”. As the will of
the Applicant to discontinue the proceedings in concreto simply does
not exist, there are no elements for forming the will of the parties as the
basis of discontinuance. The statement of the Respondent regarding
the discontinuance of the proceedings is, in this case, irrelevant and
could be qualified as an invitation or a proposal to the Applicant to
proceed to the discontinuance process provided for in Article 89,
paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court.

34. The provisions of Articles 88 and 89 of the Rules, as a part of the
procedural law of the Court, are binding rules both upon the parties and
upon the Court itself. Although created by the Court, the relevant pro-
cedural rules, as legal rules, possess an objective existence, imposing the
restraints that the Court itself must observe. The Court has no power
to modify the operation of Article 89 of the Rules ad casum. Such a con-
clusion, it seems to me, clearly derives both from the nature of the
procedural rules, as legal rules, and from the legislative history of the
Rules of Court. The proposals that it should assume such a power were
rejected with the explanation that “the parties were entitled to have
a reliable guarantee of the stability of the rules of procedure” (Sixth
Meeting of 19 May 1934, P.C.1.J., Series D, No. 2 (3rd add.), p. 38).

It is true that, in contrast to Articles 93 to 97 of Part III of the Rules,
the provisions of Article 89 can be modified or supplemented by the
parties inter se in accordance with Article 101 of the Rules of Court,
which provides:

“The parties to a case may jointly propose particular modifica-
tions or additions to the rules contained in the present Part (with the
exception of Articles 93 to 97 inclusive), which may be applied by
the Court or by a Chamber if the Court or the Chamber considers
them appropriate in the circumstances of the case.”



But the Parties to the present dispute have not had recourse to the
possibility offered by the provisions of Article 101.

35. In the light of the provisions of Article 89 of the Rules of Court
“implicit discontinuance” would be contradictio in adiecto. “Implicit dis-
continuance” is in irreconcilable collision both with the explicit intention
of the Applicant to continue the proceedings and with the formal nature
of the discontinuance process. It would, in the circumstances of the case
at hand, imply that the Court renounce the ministerial function which
basically belongs to it in the construction of discontinuance on the basis
of Article 89. Accordingly, the order on discontinuance, too, which, pur-
suant to Article 89 of the Rules, is of a declaratory nature (Article 89
determines the function of the order on discontinuance as “officially
recording the discontinuance of the proceedings”; in that sense, a per-
fectly coherent jurisprudence of the Court has also been formed”) would
assume the features of a constitutive act.

36. The respondent States, in formulating the thesis of “implicit dis-
continuance”, seem to have been inspired by the reasoning of the Court
in the cases concerning Nuclear Tests ( Australia v. France) and Nuclear
Tests (New Zealand v. France). However, the relevant facts of the
Nuclear Tests cases do not offer ground for any analogy whatsoever with
this particular case.

The Nuclear Tests cases have not been discontinued on the basis of

matic effect on the jurisdiction of the Court, then the parties, and not the
Court, would be deciding, in the substantive sense, the relevant law that
regulates the jurisdiction of the Court. And such an outcome would mean
a departure from the principle, deriving from the very essence of the judi-
cial function, i.e., that the Court is the sole judge of its jurisdiction.

(b) Normative aspect

41. In view of the fact that “the establishment or otherwise of jurisdic-
tion is not a matter for the parties but for the Court itself” (Fisheries
Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment,
L C.J. Reports 1998, p. 450, para. 37; also, individual opinion of Presi-
dent McNair in the jurisdiction phase of the case concerning Anglo-
Iranian Oil Co. in which he stated that “[a]n international tribunal can-
not regard a question of jurisdiction solely as a question inter partes”
(Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1952, pp. 116-117),
the dispute of the parties regarding the jurisdiction in the preliminary
objection phase is not a necessary condition for the Court to address
the issue of jurisdiction.

Preliminary objections raised by a party are only a tool, a procedurally
designed weapon for the establishment of the jurisdiction of the Court,
suo nomine et suo vigore, for it is under an obligation to do so ex officio.
The legal meaning of the proceedings on preliminary objection has
been defined by the Court in the case concerning Rights of Minorities in
Upper Silesia ( Minority Schools) (hereinafter referred to as “Minority
Schools™), as follows:

“the raising of an objection by one Party merely draws the attention
of the Court to an objection to the jurisdiction which it must ex
officio consider” (Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia ( Minority
Schools), Judgment No. 12, 1928, P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 15, p. 23;
emphasis added).

Or, as stated by the Court in the Genocide Convention case:

“[t]he Court must, in each case submitted to it, verify whether it has
jurisdiction to deal with the case . . . [S]Juch objections as are raised



by the Respondent may be useful to clarify the legal situation.” (Pre-
liminary Objections, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 622,
para. 46; emphasis added.)

Accordingly, the establishment of the jurisdiction by the Court in casu
is not necessarily linked with the dispute as to jurisdiction. If the duty of
the Court to verify its jurisdiction in each particular case exists regardless
of the preliminary objection as such, then the pleadings of the parties in
the proceedings are not a fortiori of decisive importance in that sense. If
as Shabtai Rosenne, commenting on the case concerning Monetary Gold
Removed from Rome in 1943 (hereinafter referred to as “Monetary
Gold”), says:

“[t]he fact that an objection is made does not mean — in the eyes
of the Court — that the Court is being asked not to determine the
merits of the claim under any circumstances” (Shabtai Rosenne,
The Law and Practice of the International Court, 1920-1996, Vol. II
(Jurisdiction), p. 863),

then the contrary is equally valid, i.e., that the Court is being asked not
to determine the merits of the claim if an objection to the preliminary
objection is not made. In that sense, an extensive practice of the Court
has been established.

The dictum of the Court in the case concerning the Appeal Relating to
the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council (hereinafter referred to as “ICAO
Council”) could represent a synthesis of that practice: “[t]he Court must
however always be satisfied that it has jurisdiction, and must if necessary
go into that matter proprio motu” (Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 52,
para. 13). This is also reflected in the opinions of judges. (In the case con-
cerning Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judge Moore in his dissent-
ing opinion stated “even though the parties be silent, the tribunal, if it
finds that competence is lacking, is bound of its own motion to dismiss
the case” (Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 58); in the
Minority Schools case, Judge Huber in his dissenting opinion found that
the Court “must ex officio ascertain on what legal foundation it is to base
its judgment upon the claims of the Parties” (Judgment No. 12, 1928,
P.C.1J., Series A, No. 15, p. 54); and in the case concerning the Free
Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Judge Kellogg pointed out
in his observations attached to the Order of 6 December 1930 that it was
not necessary that the question of jurisdiction be raised by one of the
parties, since “[i]t may and should be raised by the Court on its own ini-
tiative, as was done in the Eastern Carelia case” (Order of 6 December
1930, P.C.1J., Series A, No. 24, p. 43).)

42. The question of the jurisdiction of the Court bears two dominant
features: (a) the question of jurisdiction of the Court is a questio juris;
and (b) the question of jurisdiction of the Court is a matter of inter-
national public order.



(a) As a questio juris® the jurisdiction of the Court is within the scope
of the principle jura novit curia. In the case concerning Territorial Juris-
diction of the International Commission of the River Oder (hereinafter
referred to as “River Oder”) the Polish Government did not contend that
the Barcelona Convention had not been ratified by Poland until the oral
proceedings. The six respondents asked the Court to reject the Polish
contention a limine, for having been submitted at such an advanced stage
of the proceedings. The Court dismissed the objection as untenable for
“[t]he fact that Poland has not ratified the Barcelona Convention not
being contested, it is evident that the matter is purely one of law such as
the Court . . . should examine ex officio” (Judgment No. 16, 1929,
P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 23, p. 19).

Being bound by law, the Court is not bound by the arguments of the
parties. This follows clearly from the principle jura novit curia addressed
by the Court in its Judgments in the cases concerning Fisheries Jurisdic-
tion (United Kingdom v. Iceland) and Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal
Republic of Germany v. Iceland) :

“The Court . . . as an international judicial organ, is deemed to
take judicial notice of international law, and is therefore required in
a case falling under Article 53 of the Statute, as in any other case, to
consider on its own initiative all rules of international law which
may be relevant to the settlement of the dispute . . . for the law lies
within the judicial knowledge of the Court.” (Merits, Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 9, para. 17; ibid., p. 181, para. 18; emphasis
added.)

The principle has also been confirmed in the Nicaragua case by a dictum
that

“[flor the purpose of deciding whether the claim is well founded in
law, the principle jura novit curia signifies that the Court is not solely
dependent on the argument of the parties before it with respect to
the applicable law” (Merits, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 24,
para. 29; cf. “Lotus”, Judgment No. 9, 1927, P.C.LJ., Series A,
No. 10, p. 31);

consequently, the rule according to which a party seeking to assert a fact

8 “The existence of jurisdiction of the Court in a given case is .. . not a question of
fact, but a question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant facts.” (Border
and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admis-
sibility, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1988, p. 76, para. 16.)

The question of the Court’s jurisdiction is

“necessarily an antecedent and independent one — an objective question of law —
which cannot be governed by preclusive considerations capable of being so expressed
as to tell against either Party — or both Parties” (Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
of the ICAO Council, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 54, para. 16 (c)).



must bear the burden of proving it “has no relevance for the establish-
ment of the Court’s jurisdiction” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain
v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1998,
p. 450, para. 37).

(b) The disposition of the parties, although being the dominant prin-
ciple in the proceedings before the Court, suffers limitations.

These limitations derive from the objective rules of the Statute and the
Rules of Court defining the nature and limits of the Court’s judicial
action. As constitutional norms (R. Monaco, “Observations sur la hier-
archie des sources du droit international”, Festschrift für Hermann Mos-
ler, 1983, pp. 607-608) or as règles préceptives (intervention of Judge M.
Yovanovitch, Preliminary Session of the Court, P.C.1.J., Series D, No. 2,
p. 59), these rules transcend the disposition of the parties and pertain to
the international public order.

As a matter of international public order superior to the will of the
parties the question of jurisdiction need not necessarily be raised by the
parties themselves but the Court can and should examine it ex officio.
(Cf. Territorial Jurisdiction of the International Commission of the River
Oder, Judgment No. 16, 1929, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 23, pp. 18-19; Fish-
eries Jurisdiction ( United Kingdom v. Iceland), Jurisdiction of the Court,
Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1973, p. 7, para. 12; p. 54, para. 13; Prince von
Pless Administration, Order of 4 February 1933, P.C.LJ., Series AlB,
No. 52, p. 15; Factory at Chorzôw, Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 8, 1927,
P.C.IJ., Series A, No. 9, p. 32.)

43. In the practice of the Court the expressions ex officio and proprio
motu are used as interchangeable, although there exist differences in the
meaning of these two expressions. The expression “proprio motu” implies
the discretionary authority of the Court to take action on its own initia-
tive. The action taken by the Court “ex officio” is an expression of the
duty of the Court by virtue of its judicial function. The exclusion of the
discretion of the Court relates to the action itself and does not touch
upon the freedom of the Court in respect of the ruling.

The linking element of these two expressions is of a negative nature
and is reflected in the fact that it is about the actions which the Court
takes or may take irrespective of the will and the processual actions of
the parties.

The genuine difference in the meaning of these two expressions is over-
come in some dicta of the Court by adding the qualification “must” to
the expression “proprio motu” as in, for example, the Court’s Judgment
in the ICA O Council case (Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1972, p. 52, para. 13).
Thus, in fact, the Court’s own motion is qualified as the obligation and
the action proprio motu deprives it of discretion and turns it into action
ex officio.

44. As questio juris pertaining to the public order, jurisdiction is deter-
mined by the decision of the Court, formal or informal, on the basis of
the principle of compétence de la compétence. In the context of the case at



hand, it is necessary to distinguish between the general principle of com-
pétence de la compétence and its narrow normative projection expressed
in Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute. Namely, some of the Respon-
dents have asserted that specific terms in Article 36, paragraph 6, of the
Statute provide that “in the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has
jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court”
(counsel for the United Kingdom, CR 2004/10, p. 10; emphasis in the
original; counsel for France, CR 2004/12, p. 12).

(c) Principle compétence de la compétence

45. The general principle of compétence de la compétence represents a
basic structural and functional principle inherent to any adjudicatory
body, whether a regular court or any other body possessing adjudicatory
powers. The principle is, as pointed out by United States Commissioner
Gore in the Betsey case (1797), “indispensably necessary to the discharge
of any . . . duties” for any adjudicatory body (J. B. Moore (ed.), Inter-
national Adjudications, Ancient and Modern, History and Documents,
Modern Series, Vol. TV, p. 183).

As such the principle is confirmed in the Court’s jurisprudence. In the
Nottebohm case, the Court stated inter alia:

“Paragraph 6 of Article 36 merely adopted, in respect of the
Court, a rule consistently accepted by general international law in
the matter of international arbitration. Since the Alabama case, it
has been generally recognized, following the earlier precedents, that,
in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, an international
tribunal has the right to decide as to its own jurisdiction and has
the power to interpret for this purpose the instruments which govern
that jurisdiction . . .

Consequently, the Court has not hesitated to adjudicate on the
question of its own jurisdiction in cases in which the dispute which
had arisen in this respect went beyond the interpretation and appli-
cation of paragraph 2 of Article 36. In the Corfu Channel case
(Judgment of April 9th, 1949, IL C.J. Reports 1949, pp. 23-26 and
36), the Court adjudicated on a dispute as to whether it had jurisdic-
tion to assess the amount of compensation, a dispute which related
to the interpretation of a Special Agreement; in the Ambatielos case
(Judgment of July 1st, 1952, I. C.J. Reports 1952, p. 28), the Court
adjudicated upon a dispute as to its jurisdiction which related to the
interpretation of a jurisdictional clause embodied in a treaty; in both
cases the dispute as to the Court’s jurisdiction related to paragraph 1
and not to paragraph 2 of Article 36.

Article 36, paragraph 6, suffices to invest the Court with power to
adjudicate on its jurisdiction in the present case. But even if this were



not the case, the Court, ‘whose function is to decide in accordance
with international law such disputes as are submitted to it’
(Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Statute), should follow in this con-
nection what is laid down by general international law. The judicial
character of the Court and the rule of general international law
referred to above are sufficient to establish that the Court is compe-
tent to adjudicate on its own jurisdiction in the present case”
(Preliminary Objection, Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 119-120;
emphasis added.)

Being one of the relevant features establishing its judicial nature, the
power of the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction, emanating
from the general principle compétence de la compétence, is an inherent
right and duty of the Court knowing no limitations (cf. Electricity Com-
pany of Sofia and Bulgaria, Judgment, 1939, P.C.1.J., Series AIB, No. 77,
pp. 102-103, dissenting opinion of Judge Urrutia). The Court exercises
its inherent power from the institution of the proceedings until its end
with a view to establishing whether it possesses jurisdiction or not in
the particular case. (In reality, the Court proceeds to exercise its inherent
power in two ways: (a) by ascertaining the existence of processual
requirements for jurisdiction through prima facie assessment, being sub-
stantively a judicial presumption of jurisdiction or (b) by adopting a
formal decision on the jurisdiction. In that sense, the power of the
Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction in a given case seems
absolute, considering that the Court, even when declaring that it has no
jurisdiction in casu, exercises that inherent power.)

46. Apart from its expression in Article 36, paragraph 6, the general
principle of compétence de la compétence, has found its expression in
several provisions of the Statute. Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Statute
provides that “[t]he Court must . . . satisfy itself, not only that it has juris-
diction . . . but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law”.
In the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases, the Court stated, inter alia, that
“Article 53 of the Statute both entitles the Court and, in the present
proceedings, requires it to pronounce upon the question of its jurisdic-
tion” (Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1973, p. 22,
para. 45, and p. 66, para. 45; emphasis added).

The application of the general principle of compétence de la compé-
tence can be seen also in part of the provisions of Article 41 of the Statute
authorizing the Court to indicate provisional measures proprio motu.

The rules of the law of the Court deriving from the general principle of
compétence de la compétence are also rules in Article 32, paragraph 2, of
the Rules of Court, as well as Article 38, paragraph 5. The fact that in
both cases the relevant role is played by the Registry of the Court does
not affect the nature of the rules.

In its application the principle is not restricted to the contentious pro-



cedure. It is equally relevant also in the advisory procedure. As the Court
stated in the case concerning Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear
Weapons in Armed Conflict, “it is incumbent on the Court fo satisfy itself
that the conditions governing its own competence to give the opinion
requested are met” (Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 83,
para. 29; emphasis added). The substantive analogy between the conten-
tious and the advisory procedures (in the Status of Eastern Carelia case
the Court stated that it was the right and obligation of the Court to
examine its own jurisdiction in advisory as well as in contentious cases
(Report by the Registrar (June 1933), PC.LJ., Series D, No. 2 (3rd
add.), p. 837) in this particular matter has its foundation in the provision
of Article 68 of the Statute. The Court must in every request for an advi-
sory opinion assure itself of its jurisdiction. It is not absolved from doing
so by assuming that a request for an opinion is determinative of the
Court’s power to give opinion on the particular question. (Cf. Shabtai
Rosenne, “The Advisory Competence of the International Court of Jus-
tice”, Revue de droit international, de sciences diplomatiques et politiques
(A. Sottile, Geneva), January-March 1952, No. 1, p. 33; Georg
Schwarzenberger, “Trends in the Practice of the World Court”, Current
Legal Problems, Vol. 4, 1951, p. 27.)

47. The power of the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction in
casu, emanating from the general principle of compétence de la compé-
tence, should be distinguished from the corresponding power of the
Court to determine the extent of its jurisdiction.

The extent of jurisdiction of the Court is not a matter to be decided on
the basis of the principle of compétence de la compétence solely as a func-
tional norm, but on the basis of substantive norms of the Statute defining
the scope of exercise of the judicial function of the Court. In that regard,
the basic norm of the consensual nature of the Court’s jurisdiction, some
sort of a constitutional norm of the law of the Court and international
tribunals as well, is of relevance.

Already in its Judgment No. 2, the Permanent Court of International
Justice clearly established the limits of its jurisdiction by stating that “the
Court, bearing in mind the fact that its jurisdiction is limited, that it is
invariably based on . . . consent . . . and only exists in so far as this con-
sent has been given” (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, 1924, P.C.LJ.,
Series A, No. 2, p. 16).

48. Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute is a narrow, restrictive
expression of the general principle of compétence de la compétence. The
application of the principle of compétence de la compétence expressed in
Article 36, paragraph 6, presupposes a dispute as to whether the Court
has jurisdiction. Hence the Court, acting on the basis of Article 36, para-
graph 6, of the Statute, both logically and from the normative aspect, is
not in a position to raise a question of its jurisdiction ex officio. Basically,
the Court then, exercising its judicial function, only adjudicates the dis-
putes as to its jurisdiction ex officio. It is here that, strictissimo sensu, lies



the normative meaning of the principle of compétence de la compétence
as expressed in Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute.

In practice there were cases where the Court, in the jurisdictional phase
of the proceedings, proprio motu, raised the question not raised by
parties. For instance, in the Interhandel case the Court applied proprio
motu the objection to its jurisdiction ratione temporis to the alternative
claim (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1959, p. 22).
Such an approach of the Court could be qualified as the overlapping of
the general and the particular, i.e., of the general principle of compétence
de la compétence and its narrower expression embodied in Article 36, para-
graph 6, of the Statute.

49. It is doubtful whether the application of Article 36, paragraph 6,
of the Statute is excluded, as the respondent States asserted, in the
present case, in foto. It seems obvious that it depends on whether the
statements of parties concerning the facts coincide entirely.

That is not the case. Namely, the statements of the Parties coincide
only partially, relating mainly to the jurisdiction of the Court ratione per-
sonae, or, to be more precise, to the status of the Applicant in relation to
the Statute of the Court.

If the statements of the Parties appear to be founded in this matter,
the conclusion affects only the jurisdiction of the Court according to
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, but does not necessarily —
without knowing the finding of the Court on the meaning of the expres-
sion “the special provisions contained in treaties in force” in Article 35,
paragraph 2, of the Statute — affect the jurisdiction of the Court as set
forth in Article IX of the Genocide Convention.

Regarding the Genocide Convention as a “treaty in force” at the time
of submission of the Application, there is, however, a real —
though latent — hidden dispute between the Parties. The Applicant con-
tended that it became a party to the Genocide Convention by accession
on 12 March 2001, while the Respondents implicitly allowed that the
Applicant was a party at the time of submission of the Application.

Finally, the positions of the Parties were directly and completely
opposed regarding the jurisdiction of the Court ratione materiae and
ratione temporis.

50. The principle compétence de la compétence in its integral form —
comprising both the general principle and its expression in Article 36, para-
graph 6, of the Statute — is a judicial weapon which achieves a double
objective:

Primo, it allows the Court to establish its jurisdiction as the application
of the basis or constitutional norm of the consensual nature ir casu either
ex officio or upon objection to its jurisdiction. At the same time, it gives
the Court a legal basis to check, in the development of the proceedings,
its judicial presumptions on its jurisdiction, until a conclusive, definitive



finding on its jurisdiction. Acting in that way, in the conditions of non-
existence of multi-tier judiciary in the international community, the Court
de facto acts as a sui generis appellate court in the question of jurisdic-
tion.

Secundo, in a litigation as tripartite processual relation, it is a judicial
weapon by which the Court not only solves the dispute on jurisdiction,
but the challenge to its own decision on the jurisdiction taken in the pre-
liminary objection phase either ex officio or at the request of a party in
the revision procedure.

Therefore, it could be said that the principle of compétence de la com-
pétence in its integral expression enables the Court to ascertain in every
phase of the proceedings, according to the circumstances and degree of
knowledge, its jurisdiction as the basis and framework of the proper
administration of justice.

51. The Court, when using its right and performing its duties on the
basis of the principle of compétence de la compétence, acts, basically, in
three ways:

(i) it decides ex officio in the proceedings of preliminary objections in
the dispute between the parties as to jurisdiction;

(ii) it raises proprio motu the question of jurisdiction (or, as it is some-
times said, imprecisely, “raises an objection to jurisdiction”, for it
cannot object to jurisdiction as the determination of the matter is
in its exclusive domain), requesting the parties to act pursuant to
Article 79, paragraph 6, of the Rules or, acting itself in accordance
with Article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules. The proprio motu action
of the Court is the technical realization of the right and duty of the
Court to ascertain ex officio its competence; and

(iii) the ex officio examination of the jurisdiction as an autonomous judi-
cial action which does not rely on the actions of the parties. The very
examination of jurisdiction, apart from the decision of the Court on
jurisdiction, being some sort of organic judicial action, inherent ele-
ment of the legal reasoning of the Court, must not be exercised in a
due form, but in a manner the Court finds appropriate.

3. The Effect on the Dispute of the Congruence of Views between the
Parties as to Jurisdiction

52. In this regard, the assertions made by the Respondents have two
meanings (cf. CR 2004/6, pp. 15-17; CR 2004/7, pp. 10-12; CR 2004/10,
p. 7; CR 2004/12, p. 12):

— that just as the existence of a dispute is a preliminary condition for
the continuation of the proceedings on the merits phase, so is the



dispute as to jurisdiction a condition for the continuation of the
proceedings on preliminary objections; and

— that agreement between the parties as to a question of jurisdiction is
determinative of the case, and that, as a result, the dispute before the
Court has disappeared.

(a) The existence of a dispute as to jurisdiction as a preliminary condi-
tion for the continuation of the proceedings on preliminary objec-
tions

53. The equalization between the proceedings on the merits and the
proceedings on preliminary objection would be highly doubtful. Namely,
it ignores the specific features of judicial activity of the Court in the juris-
dictional phase of the proceedings, features which derive from the nature
of the question of jurisdiction. (“The Court finds that Italy’s acceptance
of jurisdiction is one thing, while her raising of a legal issue on jurisdic-
tion is quite another.” (Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943,
Preliminary Question, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 29.) The prac-
tical outcome of such equalization would consist of the treatment of the
question of jurisdiction as quaestio facti and as a matter inter partes
which is in sharp contradiction with its true nature (see paragraphs 40-44
of this opinion).

54. It is based on the idea of the transplantation of the rule regarding
“the existence of a dispute [as] the primary condition for the Court to
exercise its judicial function” (Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France),
Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 476, para. 58) in the merits phase of a
case into the incidental proceedings of the preliminary objections. This
transplantation is however impossible taking into consideration the very
nature of the question of jurisdiction. It is directly aimed against the
inherent right and duty of the Court to determine its jurisdiction. In that
regard, the formulation of the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court
concerning preliminary objections is indicative. Paragraph 2 of Article 79
of the Rules provides in imperative (wording) formulation that “the pre-
liminary objection shall set out the facts and the law on which the objec-
tion is based” (emphasis added) whereas paragraph 3 of Article 79 pro-
vides, inter alia, that “the other party may present a written statement of
its observations and submissions” (emphasis added). The asymmetrical
relations between the provisions of Article 79 of the Rules — obliga-
tions stricti juris of the Respondent on the one hand, and a right of the
Applicant on the other — represent an indirect expression of a different
nature of the proceedings on the merits and that of the incidental pro-
ceedings on preliminary objection (Article 49 of the Rules establishes the
duties of the parties regarding the Memorial and Counter-Memorial
symmetrically).

55. There is a substantive symmetry in the relevant elements of
the case in hand and the Monetary Gold case. In the latter case, Great



Britain, in its final Submission No. 1 (b) contended that, by raising the
preliminary objection, the

“Application . . .

(b) has been in effect withdrawn or cancelled by Italy” (Preliminary
Question, Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 25; see also ibid.,
p. 30).

However, the Court found that “[t]he raising of the Preliminary Question
by Italy cannot be regarded as equivalent to a discontinuance” (ibid.,
p. 30). As to the Submission contending that the Italian Application
should be held to be “invalid and void” (ibid. ), the Court found that

“it is enough to state that the Application, if not invalid at the time
it was filed, cannot subsequently have become invalid by reason of
the preliminary question which Italy raised with regard to the Court’s
jurisdiction in this case” (ibid. ).

(b) The congruence of views between the Parties as to jurisdiction and
the alleged disappearance of the dispute on the merits

56. The contention that there exists a substantive nexus between the
dispute as to jurisdiction and the dispute on the merits is, in the light of
the uniform jurisprudence of the Court on the issue of a legal dispute,
even more surprising. The relevant constituent elements of the legal dis-
pute seem to be clearly presented in the case at hand.

The contents of the Application, the Memorial, the Preliminary Objec-
tions and other relevant materials, create a clear picture of the situation
in which “two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question
of the performance or non-performance of certain treaty obligations”
(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania,
First Phase, Advisory Opinion, LC.J. Reports 1950, p. 74; hereinafter
referred to as “Interpretation of Peace Treaties”) as well as the perform-
ance of obligations under general international law embodied in the
United Nations Charter (Memorial of 5 January 2000, pp. 301-346). The
Applicant charges the Respondents that by “bombing of Yugoslav terri-
tory” (Memorial, p. 301, para. 2.1.1.) they violated a number of its inter-
national obligations including not only in the international treaties in
force, but also in the Charter of the United Nations. The Respondents
denied the charge.

57. By denying the charges, the Respondents, within the limits and the
range determined by the stage of the procedure, elaborate diametrically
opposite legal concepts according to which the bombing of the territory
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was carried out lege artis, in con-



formity with the concept of the so-called humanitarian intervention, as
well as by obeying the rules of humanitarian law. This constitutes the
second qualifying condition for the existence of the legal dispute — “that
the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other” (South West
Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1962, p. 328;
emphasis added). Acting in the above-mentioned manner, the Respon-
dents have gone out of the reach of a simple denial of the Applicant’s
charges and set the matter on the level of a conflict of legal views, the
conflict of which is in concreto total and absolute.

58. The issue of the existence of a dispute on the merits possesses its
temporal dimension. As the Court stated in the case concerning Nuclear
Tests (Australia v. France) “[t]he dispute brought before [the Court]
must therefore continue to exist at the time when the Court makes its
decision” (Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 271, para. 55).

A dispute in existence in the proceedings before the Court may, in
general, disappear in two ways:

in the provisional measures phase of the proceedings, on the one hand,
and its make-up in the preliminary objections phase of the proceedings,
on the other, is noticeable. It calls for comments as a matter of principle.

During the provisional measures phase of the proceedings nine out of
a total of ten respondent States had judges sitting on the Bench of the
Court, irrespective of whether these were national judges (France, Ger-
many, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of
America) or judges ad hoc (Belgium, Canada, Italy and Spain). Among
the respondent States having no judge of their nationality on the Bench,
only Portugal has not designated its Judge ad hoc. The Applicant, for its
part, had one judge ad hoc on the Bench.

In the preliminary objections phase, the Bench underwent a significant
change. At the opening of the public sitting held on 19 April 2004, the
President of the Court stated, inter alia, that

“[b]y letters dated 23 December 2003, the Registrar informed the
Parties that the Court had decided . . . that the judges ad hoc chosen
by the respondent States should not sit during the current phase of
the procedure in these cases” (CR 2004/6, p. 6).

He also noted that “Judge Simma had previously considered that he
should not take part in the decision of these cases and had so informed
[the President] in accordance with Article 24 of the Statute” (ibid., p. 7).
Thus, during the preliminary objections phase the Bench included
three national judges on the side of the respondent States and one ad hoc
judge on the side of the Applicant.
It is interesting to note that the Court, in adopting relevant decisions,

10 It might be mentioned in passing that the practice for the “removal clause” to be
included at all into the dispositif of a judgment of the Court is open to question ; not only
because of the fact that, as a rule, a case which has been completed is removed automati-
cally from the General List of pending cases, but also because of the nature of the judicial
decision of the Court which concerns the parties to the dispute rather than a matter that,
basically, concerns the internal functioning of the Court.



failed to provide an explanation in more detail, both with respect to par-
ticular decisions concerning the composition of the Court in the proceed-
ings on preliminary objections and with respect to the substantial change
in the two successive phases of the proceedings.

In the provisional measures phase the Court, acting on the objections
raised by the Applicant relating to the nominations of judges ad hoc by
four respondent States, settled for a succinct formulation that the nomi-
nations were “justified in the present phase of the case” !!. The Court was
somewhat more specific in the relevant decision relating to its own
make-up in the preliminary objections phase. Even though, in contrast to
the provisional measures phase, the Applicant raised no objections regard-
ing the participation of judges ad hoc chosen by the respondent States. In
deciding that “the judges ad hoc chosen by the respondent States should
not sit during the current phase of the procedure” (CR 2004/6, p. 6), the
Court invoked the fact of “the presence on the Bench of judges of British,
Dutch and French nationality” (CR 2004/6, p. 6).

68. From the terse formulation relating to the acceptance of the nomi-
nations of judges ad hoc by four respondent States in the provisional
measures phase one could infer that the Court, in adopting the decision
that their nominations were justified, relied on the grammatical interpre-
tation of the provision of Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute. Namely,
Article 31, paragraph 3, provides that “[i]f the Court includes upon the
Bench no judge of the nationality of the parties, each of these parties may
proceed to choose a judge”. In other words, the Court followed the logic
that the independent and inherent right of a party to choose a judge ad
hoc on the basis of Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute, was not sub-
ject to any particular restrictions in this particular case. The Applicant
founded its objection to the nomination of the judges ad hoc by four
respondent States on the contention that they are parties in the same
interest and that, consequently, paragraph 5 of Article 31 of the Statute
should have been applied. The Court, in its decision does not deal spe-
cifically with this contention of the Applicant, although the decision itself
implies that the Court rejected it.

69. The absence of an explanation leaves room for assumptions. One
of them, it seems to me, that merits attention rests on the interpretation
of the expression “several parties in the same interest” (Statute, Art. 31,
para. 5). It has been said that

“Article 31, which uses a form of wording in the singular, ‘applies
separately to each case on the Court’s List’. ‘In the presence of two

separate cases between two sets of parties (even if one party is com-
mon to both cases), Article 31, paragraph 5, has no application’.”
(H. Thirlway, “The Law and Procedure of the International Court
of Justice, 1960-1989 (Part Eleven)”, The British Year Book of Inter-
national Law, 2000, p. 167, emphasis added, citing joint declaration
of Judges Bedjaoui, Guillaume and Ranjeva in Questions of Inter-
pretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising
from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I C.J.
Reports 1998, p. 40.)

It appears that the interpretation is far too narrow and, in the light of the
meaning and in particular of the application of Article 31, paragraph 5,
of the Statute, arbitrary because it implies an indissoluble organic link
between “parties in the same interest” and formal joinder, which is
obviously not the case. The Court may find that the parties are in the
same interest without having recourse to joinder. Moreover, it is said
that “the ‘same interest’ provisions apply” only “in the case of the choice
of judges ad hoc” (G. Guillaume, “La ‘cause commune’ devant la Cour
internationale de Justice”, Liber Amicorum — Mohammed Bedjaoui
(Emile Yakpo and Tahar Boumedra, eds.), 1999, p. 330 [translation by
the Registry]). The jurisprudence of the Court was also formed in this
sense 12,

Consequently, the provision of Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute
according to which the parties in the same interest shall be reckoned as
one party only, cannot be understood as being tantamount to joinder.
Although the same interest of the parties constitutes an element of the
notion of joinder, taken per se it neither constitutes formal joinder nor
can be considered identical to it. Joinder implies that the parties in the
same interest are reckoned as one party in the totality of their procedural
position which, in addition to the appointment of a single judge ad hoc
includes also one set of pleadings and a single judgment.

The parties in the same interest, in the sense of Article 31, paragraph 5,
of the Statute, are reckoned as one party in a restricted, functional sense
versus the process position of parties in its totality in the event of the
issue of joinder, and that is the choice of judges ad hoc. The formulation
according to which “several parties in the same interest . . . shall . . . be
reckoned as one party only” (Statute, Art. 31, para. 5) is made not for the

12 Exempli causa,

“in the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases, the Court did not join the cases, and rendered
two distinct series of judgments, both on jurisdiction and on the merits. However,
that did not prevent it from regarding the United Kingdom and Germany as being ‘in
the same interest’ during the initial phase of the procedure.” (G. Guillaume, “La
‘cause commune’ devant la Cour internationale de Justice”, Liber Amicorum —
Mohammed Bedjaoui, 1999, pp. 330, 334-335 [translation by the Registry ]).



purpose of a joinder but “for the purpose of the preceding provisions”
(Statute, Art. 31, para. 5) of Article 31 regulating equalization of the
parties before the Court.

If we continue for a moment to use the terminology of joinder, we
could possibly qualify the parties in the same interest, in the sense of
Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute, as a kind of small or procedural
joinder substantively and functionally linked with the choice of judges
ad hoc on the basis of the provisions of Article 31 of the Statute of the
Court.

70. The fundamental difference in the composition of the Court in the
provisional measures phase as against the preliminary objections phase
could be defended with the argument that in the provisional measures
phase the Court was not in a position to ascertain the positions of the
respondent States vis-a-vis the demands of the Applicant. The argument
bears a certain weight but it should not be overestimated in this particu-
lar case for two reasons at least. Primo, the question of the composition
of the Court is a matter of public order (in the Advisory Opinion case
concerning Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of
South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security
Council Resolution 276 (1970) (hereinafter referred to as “Namibia”),
Vice-President Ammoun pointed out in his separate opinion that it
relates to “the rule of . . . very equality which the Statute seeks to safe-
guard through the institution of judges ad hoc” (I. C.J. Reports 1971,
p. 68)) possessing “absolute logical priority” (ibid., p. 25, para. 36; see
also Western Sahara, Order of 22 May 1975, LC.J. Reports 1975,
pp. 7-8; Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, LC.J. Reports 1975, p. 17-
18, para. 13). Secundo, the indication for consideration of the same
interest of the respondent States was provided in the Application itself
which related to all the ten respondent States with identical statements
of facts and law. The Application itself offered the basis for a prima facie
appreciation of the facts and law for the treatment of “the appointment
of a judge ad hoc . . . as a preliminary matter” (Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South
West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970),
Advisory Opinion, 1. C.J. Reports 1971, p. 25, para. 36). Tertio, the
urgency of the proceedings for interim measures could hardly be deemed
to have been an obstacle to such proceedings in this particular case,
because the proceedings for interim measures themselves lasted over
30 days, counting from the date of submission of the request to the
date of the rendering of the order.

71. The decision regarding the composition of the Court in both phases,
the provisional measures phase and the preliminary objections phase, was
adopted informally, being intimated to the Parties by the Registrar. (The
Court has thus departed from the practice established in the South West
Africa cases (cf. Order of 18 March 1965, 1.C.J. Reports 1965, p. 3) in
which the decision about the composition of the Court was adopted in the



form of an order.) This practice possessed certain inherent advantages,
both formal and those of a substantive nature. As far as the formal
advantages are concerned, it is difficult to understand that the issue of
composition of the Court is regulated informally, at least when more
delicate and controversial cases are in question, whereas issues, such as
the appointment of experts of the Court (cf. Corfu Channel, Order of
19 November 1949, I. C.J. Reports 1949, p. 237; Delimitation of the Mari-
time Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area, Appointment of Expert, Order
of 30 March 1984, 1.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 165), the appointment of
experts to assist the parties to implement a judgment (cf. Frontier Dispute,
Nomination of Experts, Order of 9 April 1987, LC.J. Reports 1987,
p. 7), or decisions on a request for an inspection in loco (cf. South West
Africa, Order of 29 November 1965, 1.C.J. Reports 1965, p. 9; Gabéikovo-
Nagymaros Project ( Hungaryl/ Slovakia), Order of 5 February 1997, I.C.J.
Reports 1997, p. 3) are dealt with through a formal order. Although there
is no difference in the legal effect of decisions adopted informally or in the
legal effect of those adopted in a formal manner, the manner in which a
decision of the Court is embodied bears the meaning of an implicit evalua-
tion of the issues being the object of the decision. This practice is all the
more surprising having in mind that the question of the composition of
the Court is not a purely procedural matter, but, in cases such as the case
in hand, a matter of public order that indirectly concerns the principle of
equality of States as one of the fundamental principles of international
law which falls within corpus juris cogentis.

Also indisputable, it seems to me, are the substantive advantages of
making decisions on the composition of the Court in a formal manner.
They emanate from the very structure of the order, in particular from the
special considerations that the Court had in mind making the order and
reasons justifying a particular decision on the composition of the Court.
Thus, an easier and more reliable interpretation of the decision of the
Court is enabled and, equally important, a consolidation of jurisprudence
of the Court on the matter.

72. The decision of the Court by which three respondent States (Bel-
gium, Canada and Italy) have been denied the extension of the appoint-
ments of their judges ad hoc in the preliminary objections phase, and
denying Portugal the right to appoint a judge ad hoc, is based on
Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute which provides that “[s]Jhould
there be several parties in the same interest, they shall, for the purpose
of the preceding provisions, be reckoned as one party only. Any doubt
upon this point shall be settled by the decision of the Court.”

(a) As regards Belgium, Canada and Italy, the Court adopted the rele-
vant decision “pursuant to Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute, taking
into account the presence on the Bench of judges of British, Dutch and
French nationality” (CR 2004/6, pp. 6-7; emphasis added). The interpre-
tation of this explanation of the Court’s decision inevitably leads to the
conclusion that the Court considered not only Belgium, Canada and Italy



as parties in the same interest, but also France, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom.

The effect of Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute obviously could
not have been the deprivation of Belgium, Canada and Italy’s right,
“reckoned as one party only”, to have upon the Bench a single judge ad
hoc, but of the extension of the appointments of judges ad hoc which they
had appointed individually in the provisional measures phase. The dep-
rivation was legally founded only if the Court had found that these three
respondent States, together with France, the Netherlands and the United
Kingdom, were in the position of “parties in the same interest”. The
argument of the Court is suggestive of this but not explicit, because it
only referred to the “presence on the Bench of judges of British, Dutch
and French nationality” (CR 2004/6, p. 6) as ratio of exclusion of the
right of Belgium, Canada and Italy to choose a single judge ad hoc with-
out saying that all of them were parties in the same interest. A direct
nexus between these two matters — on the one hand, the deprivation of
the three respondent States, having no judge of their nationality on the
Bench, of their right to choose a single judge ad hoc, and, on the other
hand, the presence on the Bench of judges of the nationality of the three
other respondent States, having judges of their nationality on the Bench —
is only possible to establish on the basis of the same interest position of
all these respondent States.

(b) As far as Germany is concerned, as Judge Simma had considered
that he should not take part in the decision in this case, Germany, on the
basis of Article 37, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court became “entitled
to choose a judge ad hoc within a time-limit to be fixed by the Court,
or by the President”. The Court, however, decided that the entitlement
under Article 37 is non-existent in casu “pursuant to Article 31, para-
graph 5, of the Statute” (CR 2004/6, p. 7). In other words, the Court sub-
sumed the position of Germany in this particular matter under Article 37,
paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court which provides that “/p/arties in the
same interest shall be deemed not to have a judge of one of their nation-
alities . . . if the Member of the Court . . . is or becomes unable to sit”
(emphasis added).

Consequently, the Court, proceeding from the “same interest” provi-
sion embodied in Article 31, paragraph 1, of the Statute and elaborated
in Article 37, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Rules of Court, by its decision
notified to the Parties by letters of the Registrar dated 23 December 2003,
took the position that all eight respondent States are parties in the same
interest.

73. The decision of the Court produced equalization effects in the
composition of the Bench between the Applicant, on the one hand, and
the Respondents, on the other.

The equalization effects are expressed on two levels:

(i) on the level of the relation between the applicant State and those



respondent States having no national judge upon the Bench. Unlike
the provisional measures phase, full equalization was realized in the
preliminary objections phase in accordance with the perfectly coher-
ent jurisprudence of the Court, thanks to the decision of the Court.
(Cf. joint declaration of Judges Bedjaoui, Guillaume and Ranjeva,
Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal
Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, pp. 34-39);

(ii) on the level of the relation between the applicant State and those res-
pondent States having Members of their nationality upon the Bench.
On this level partial equalization has been realized given the fact that
Judge Simma had decided not to take part in the decision in the case,
and the Court’s decision that Germany, pursuant to Article 31, para-
graph 5, of the Statute was not entitled to choose a judge ad hoc.

Thus the relation between the applicant State and the respondent
States having Members of their nationality upon the Bench suffered a
change in the concrete matter in comparison with the composition of the
Court in the procedure on provisional measures — three respondent
States (France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) have their
national judges upon the Bench and the applicant State has a judge ad
hoc on the Bench.

Can such a solution be considered tenable in law and justice? The
answer to this question, it seems to me, is in the negative rather than in
the positive.

In the construction of Article 31, paragraphs 1 to 5, of the Statute, the
arithmetical equality of the numbers of judges upon the Bench having the
nationality of the parties, in the relevant variants of the relation between
the number of national judges (Art. 31, para. 1), national judges and
judges ad hoc (Art. 31, para. 2) or judges ad hoc mutually (Art. 31,
para. 3), figures as an expression of equality of the parties. Although
equality of the parties is not exhausted in the arithmetical equality, it
seems incontestable that, in the relations among States as sovereign
political units, the arithmetical equality is an important constitutive ele-
ment of equality: a contrario, the provisions of Article 31, paragraphs 1
to 5, of the Statute as such would be devoid of substance.

It is obvious that in concreto this arithmetical equality is non-existent
despite the fact that the respondent States are parties in the same interest.
What is involved, in fact, is but one example of inequality of the parties,
inequality that comes about due to grammatical interpretation of
Article 31, paragraph 4, of the Statute.

For as Judge Guillaume notes, referring to Article 31, paragraph 4, of
the Statute,

“This provision guaranteed equality between the parties where



neither had a national on the Bench. Thus in such cases, whether
there is a plurality of applicants, or of respondents, or of both, only
one judge ad hoc is chosen to sit on each side.

The system worked equally well where the Court included a judge
of the nationality of one of the parties and the latter objected to a
plurality of applicants or respondents acting in the same interest and
not having a judge of their own nationality present on the Bench.
Here again, equality was effectively guaranteed.

On the other hand, the system was more open to criticism where
on one side there were several States with judges of their nationality
on the Bench, whereas on the other there was only one judge, or
even merely a judge ad hoc.” (G. Guillaume, “La ‘cause commune’
devant la Cour internationale de Justice”, Liber Amicorum —
Mohammed Bedjaoui (Emile Yakpo and Tahar Boumedra, eds.),
1999, pp. 328-329; emphasis added.)

It follows, consequently, that in the event of conflict between the prin-
ciple of permanence of the Court and equality of parties “the authors of
the Statute and Rules accorded priority to the principle of the perma-
nence of the Court”, having restricted the application of the principle of
equality of parties “in regard to choice of judges ad hoc to situations
where the ‘common interest’ provisions apply” (ibid, p. 330 [translation
by the Registry].

Such a state of affairs is hardly tenable. The deficiencies of the solu-
tions enshrined in the Statute and in the Rules of Court cannot constitute
a basis for a derogation of the fundamental principle of equality of
parties. The principle of equality of parties is but one ingredient, a con-
stitutive element of a broader principle of sovereign equality of States.
Although the Statute and the Rules of Court are, by their nature, jus spe-
cialis designed to regulate the work of the Court, it cannot be accepted
that they authorize, as such, the Court to disregard the relevant norms of
general international law. And, as the Statute itself determines, the Court’s
function “is to decide in accordance with international law” (Statute,
Art. 38, para. 1). Especially as concerns contemporary international law
which, unlike international law that was in effect at the time of drawing
up of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, recog-
nizes jus cogens the rules of overriding importance that, by definition,
brook no competition of incongruous rules. And the principle of sovereign
equality of States is undoubtedly a rule that belongs to corpus juris
cogentis.

74. The issue of the realization of the overriding rule of equality of
States in regard to the composition of the Bench is, basically, an issue of
a technical, derivative nature. There are two ways that seem to be appro-



priate, independently or in combination, depending on the circumstances
of a particular case. One of them boils down to the exemption of a Mem-
ber or Members of the Court in the event that there exists inequality
between the litigant parties in multiple cases in which one party is com-
prised of two or several States whose judges sit in the Court. Whereas the
other party is composed of a State (or States) that do not have national
judges or have a smaller number of national judges as compared to the
other side. In such a case a solution could be found within the co-ordi-
nates of the proposal submitted at the time of the revision of the Rules of
Court in 1926, according to which:

“Where one of the parties is represented by two or more States
having judges present on the Bench, only one of those judges, to be
chosen by the States in question, may take part in the proceedings
and judgment in the case.” (Statut et Réglement de la Cour perma-
nente de Justice internationale — Eléments d'interprétation, Carl
Heymanns Verlag, Berlin, 1934, p. 189, cited in G. Guillaume, “La
‘cause commune’ devant la Cour internationale de Justice”, Liber
Amicorum — Mohammed Bedjaoui (Emile Yakpo and Tahar Bou-
medra, eds.), 1999, p. 329. [Translation by the Registry.])

Two objections could be raised with respect to this way of solving the
issue. The first is that it implies revision of Article 31, paragraph 1, of the
Statute. The objection is justified, but only partially, having in mind that,
by the application of Article 24, paragraph 2, of the Statute, it is possible
to achieve equalization even without a formal revision of the Statute. The
circumstances that two or more States whose judges sit in the Court —
States that are parties in the same interest — can be regarded by the
President of the Court as a “special reason” for having recourse to the
authority being at their disposal on the basis of Article 24, paragraph 2,
of the Statute. It is difficult, however, to imagine that a broader applica-
tion of this provision of the Statute is feasible, not only because of the
principle of permanence of the function of a Member of the Court, but
also because of the requirement relating to the minimal number of judges
constituting the Court (Statute, Art. 25, para. 2). Still, the possibilities
offered by this provision of the Statute should not be underestimated,
especially if the principle of permanence is interpreted systematically,
without the ingredients of a fetish. In that sense, the principle of perma-
nence of the Court is of a relative nature, not only because of the provi-
sion of the Statute stipulating that a third of judges shall be elected every
third year (Statute, Art. 13), but also because of the fact that a judge or
judges may be prevented from sitting on the Bench for factual or legal
reasons (Statute, Art. 23, para. 3, and Art. 24, para. 1).

The other manner would consist in giving the right to a party having
no judge of its nationality on the Bench to nominate more than one judge
ad hoc if equalization cannot be achieved in some other way. There exist
no substantive obstacles in the Statute to this manner of equalization.
The fact that Article 31, paragraph 2, of the Statute refers to the right of



“any other party” (i.e., a party other than the party which has a judge of
its nationality) to “choose a person to sit as judge” in the singular, cannot
be regarded as a ban on “any other party” to choose more than one judge
ad hoc. Article 31, paragraph 2, of the Statute is, both by diction and by
the terms used, designed individualistically, i.e., one party (having a judge
of its nationality on the Bench)/other party (party other than the party
having a judge of its nationality on the Bench). When multiple cases,
such as the cases at hand, are involved, the said provision should be
interpreted teleologically.

A contrario, it remains unclear how equalization, as an expression and
manner of ensuring the fundamental principle of equality of States, could
be achieved. For it should be borne in mind that it is not only about
nominal equality between parties, considering that even a quick look at
the voting practice in the Court shows that differences between national
judges and judges ad hoc in the cases in which States of their nationalities
were involved are not so significant as usually presumed.

75. The schedule of public hearings in the eight cases concerning the
Legality of Use of Force held from 19 April 2004 to 23 April 2004, taken
per se and in particular in connection with the decision of the Court
relating to the composition of the Court in these cases, represents a
specific and unusual approach of the Court.

Prima facie, the schedule of public hearings reflects the idea of consoli-
dation of separate proceedings in the sense of a logical order of the hear-
ings. More precisely, during the first round of pleadings on the prelimi-
nary objections held on 19 and 20 April, all eight respondent States
submitted their pleadings, whereas the Applicant did so on 21 April 2004.
The schedule was basically applied to the second round of pleadings, so
that 22 April 2004 was reserved for the eight respondent States and
23 April 2004 for the Applicant. However, a couple of things contradict
a simple equalization of this schedule of public hearings with the consoli-
dation of separate proceedings. Primo, the schedule departs from the
logical and normal practice that after the pleading of one respondent
State, who raised preliminary objections, there follows the pleading of
the Applicant, bearing in mind that a separate pleading is in question. It
is possible to argue that eight respondent States were in question, so that
the schedule of public hearings in the form in which it is designed was
meant to avoid possible duplication in the arguments of the Parties, in
particular that of the Applicant. Leaving aside the fact that such reason-
ing implies also substantive similarity or identity of pleadings of the
respondent States, it is clear already from a quick reading of the official
records of pleadings that, as designed, the schedule of public hearings did
not exclude duplication of arguments. Secundo, the order of pleadings of
the respondent States does not correspond to their order in the List of
pending cases. Moreover, it is in contrast also with the order of pleadings
of the respondent States in the provisional measures phase of the cases.



The Court decided at the time that after Yugoslavia, as the applicant
State, the respondent States should make their presentations in English
alphabetical order (International Court of Justice, Press Release 99/19 of
7 May 1999), which is also the order of the cases in the official name of
the cases on the Court’s List of pending cases. This would not merit too
much attention by itself. It could simply be a matter of convenience —
if it were not followed also by grouping of the respondent States in the
schedule of public hearings. Thus, within the framework of the first
round of oral pleadings, the morning session of the Court on 19 April
2004 was reserved for Belgium and the Netherlands. Also, the morning
session of the following day was reserved for Germany, France and Italy.
Although the Court offered no explanation for the reasons for such a
grouping, which cannot be taken as unusual, it is reasonable to assume
that the Court relied, among other things, also on different jurisdictional
claims pointed out by the applicant State. (Namely, with respect to Bel-
gium and the Netherlands, the Applicant presented also additional titles
of jurisdiction, i.e., Article 4 of the Convention of Conciliation, Judicial
Settlement and Arbitration between Belgium and the Kingdom of Yugo-
slavia dated 25 March 1930, and Article 4 of the Treaty of Judicial Settle-
ment, Arbitration and Conciliation between the Netherlands and the
Kingdom of Yugoslavia dated 11 March 1931.) On the other hand, the
process position of Germany, France and Italy is characterized by the
fact that these three respondent States have not made a declaration of
acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36,
paragraph 2, of the Statute. Tertio, there has appeared an intriguing
coincidence of the said grouping of the respondent States in the schedule
of public hearings and of the composition of the Court derived from it, a
composition that would completely fit in with the principle of equality of
parties. If, ex hypothesi, joinder has been established for groups of cases
in accordance with the schedule of public hearings held on 19 and
20 April 2004 (joinder for Belgium and the Netherlands, a second for
Germany, France and Italy, and a third for the United Kingdom, Portu-
gal and Canada), then the relation between the Applicant and the groups
of respondent States included in the said joinders would be brought to
the point of full equality of the Parties as far as the composition of the
Court is concerned.

76. The question of locus standi of Serbia and Montenegro before
the Court, or its jurisdiction, is one thing, and the question of the legality
of use of force is another.

Due to the inherent features of the jurisdiction of the Court — the
consensual nature coupled with limited access — the Court was not in a
position to make a pronouncement with regard to the legality of use of
force in these particular cases.



This fact testifies by itself to the delicate position in which the Court,
as the world Court, may find itself.

The Court, whose function is “to decide in accordance with interna-
tional law” (Statute, Art. 38, para. 1) disputes as are submitted to it is, in
these particular cases, hindered in a way in carrying out its function in
regard to the issue that certainly cannot be regarded as an ordinary one.

The question of the use of force in relations between States in an onto-
logical issue of the international order. It is a watershed of the primitive
de facto order that is governed by the elements of constellation of powers
and opportunism, and of the de jure international order embodied in the
rule of law.

On this occasion it seems appropriate to observe that we are witnessing
a cacophony of voices, coming as a rule from the circle of powerful
and influential States, to the effect that the sovereignty of States is just
history. As far as international law and the Court, as its organ, are con-
cerned, it is painful and surprising to realize that, among the advocates
of limited sovereignty, there can hardly be found those supporting a limi-
tation of sovereignty in, probably, the only aspect where limitation of
sovereignty — irrespective of the will of the States — corresponds with
the idea of a legally organized international community. Namely, that
disputes between States should be solved before the Court and not on the
battlefield.

The ratio of existence of international law rests in its implementation,
especially when it comes to rules that have an overriding character.
Hence, one can understand the calls, or perhaps entreaties, addressed to
the Court that

“Yugoslavia was at least entitled to deliberation on the merits of
its claim . . . rather than being brushed off on a jurisdictional tech-
nicality” (Anthony D’Amato in “Review of the ICJ Order of June 2,
1999 on the Illegality [sic] of Use of Force Case”, as found in “Kos-
ovo & Yugoslavia: Law in Crisis”, a presentation of Jurist (source:
http ://jurist.law.pitt.edu/amatol.htm at 22 November 2004)).

It remains for the Court, fettered by the strong rules of its jurisdiction,
to appeal, if at all, to the Parties, somewhat quixotically, to be aware
of their responsibilities under international law, following the practice
in some previous cases (exempli causa, Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain
v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1998,
p. 456, para. 56) or to address the matter even in a more qualified
manner.
