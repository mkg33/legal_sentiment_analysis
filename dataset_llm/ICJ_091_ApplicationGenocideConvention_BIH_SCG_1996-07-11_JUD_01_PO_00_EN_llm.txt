16. Bosnia and Herzegovina has principally relied, as a basis for the
Jurisdiction of the” Court in this case, on Article IX of the Genocide
Convention. The Court will initially consider the preliminary objections
raised by Yugoslavia on this point. It takes note, first, of the withdrawal
by Yugoslavia, during the oral proceedings, of its fourth preliminary
objection, which therefore need no longer be dealt with. In its third objec-
tion, Yugoslavia, on various grounds, has disputed the contention that
the Convention binds the two Parties or that it has entered into force
between them; and in its fifth objection, Yugoslavia has objected, for
various reasons, to the argument that the dispute submitted by Bosnia



and Herzegovina falls within the provisions of Article IX of the Conven-
tion. The Court will consider these two alleged grounds of lack of juris-
diction in turn.

*

17. The proceedings instituted before the Court are between two States
whose territories are located within the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia. That Republic signed the Genocide Convention on
11 December 1948 and deposited its instrument of ratification, without
reservation, on 29 August 1950. At the time of the proclamation of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 27 April 1992, a formal declaration
was adopted on its behalf to the effect that:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continuing the State,
international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, shall strictly abide by all the commitments
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed interna-
tionally.”

This intention thus expressed by Yugoslavia to remain bound by the
international treaties to which the former Yugoslavia was party was con-
firmed in an official Note of 27 April 1992 from the Permanent Mission
of Yugoslavia to the United Nations, addressed to the Secretary-General.
The Court observes, furthermore, that it has not been contested that
Yugoslavia was party to the Genocide Convention. Thus, Yugoslavia
was bound by the provisions of the Convention on the date of the filing
of the Application in the present case, namely, on 20 March 1993.

18. For its part, on 29 December 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina trans-
mitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as depositary of
the Genocide Convention, a Notice of Succession in the following terms:

“the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, having
considered the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the Crime of Genocide, of December 9, 1948, to which the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a party, wishes to suc-
ceed to the same and undertakes faithfully to perform and carry out
all the stipulations therein contained with effect from March 6, 1992,
the date on which the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina became
independent”.

On 18 March 1993, the Secretary-General communicated the following
Depositary Notification to the parties to the Genocide Convention:

“On 29 December 1992, the notification of succession by the
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the above-mentioned
Convention was deposited with the Secretary-General, with effect
from 6 March 1992, the date on which Bosnia and Herzegovina
assumed responsibility for its international relations.”



19. Yugoslavia has contested the validity and legal effect of the Notice
of 29 December 1992, contending that, by its acts relating to its accession
to independence, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had flagrantly
violated the duties stemming from the “principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples”. According to Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herze-
govina was not, for this reason, qualified to become a party to the con-
vention. Yugoslavia subsequently reiterated this objection in the third
preliminary objection which it raised in this case.

The Court notes that Bosnia and Herzegovina became a Member of
the United Nations following the decisions adopted on 22 May 1992 by
the Security Council and the General Assembly, bodies competent under
the Charter. Article XI of the Genocide Convention opens it to “any
Member of the United Nations”; from the time of its admission to the
Organization, Bosnia and Herzegovina could thus become a party to the
Convention. Hence the circumstances of its accession to independence
are of little consequence.

20. Tt is clear from the foregoing that Bosnia and Herzegovina could
become a party to the Convention through the mechanism. of State
succession. Moreover, the Secretary-General of the United Nations con-
sidered that this had been the case, and the Court took note of this in
its Order of 8 April 1993 (Application of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures,
LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 16, para. 25).

21. The Parties to the dispute differed as to the legal consequences to
be drawn from the occurrence of a State succession in the present case. In
this context, Bosnia and Herzegovina has, among other things, con-
tended that the Genocide Convention falls within the category of instru-
ments for the protection of human rights, and that consequently, the rule
of “automatic succession” necessarily applies. Bosnia and Herzegovina
concluded therefrom that it became a party to the Convention with effect
from its accession to independence. Yugoslavia disputed any “automatic
succession” of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Genocide Convention on
this or any other basis.

22. As regards the nature of the Genocide Convention, the Court
would recall what it stated in its Advisory Opinion of 28 May 1951 relat-
ing to the Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide:

“In such a convention the contracting States do not have any
interests of their own; they merely have, one and all, a common
interest, namely, the accomplishment of those high purposes which
are the raison d’être of the convention. Consequently, in a conven-
tion of this type one cannot speak of individual advantages or dis-
advantages to States, or of the maintenance of a perfect contractual
balance between rights and duties.” (I. C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23.)



The Court subsequently noted in that Opinion that:

“The object and purpose of the Genocide Convention imply that
it was the intention of the General Assembly and of the States which
adopted it that as many States as possible should participate. The
complete exclusion from the Convention of one or more States
would not only restrict the scope of its application, but would
detract from the authority of the moral and humanitarian principles
which are its basis.” (I. C.J. Reports 1951, p. 24.)

23. Without prejudice as to whether or not the principle of “automatic
succession” applies in the case of certain types of international treaties or
conventions, the Court does not consider it necessary, in order to decide
on its jurisdiction in this case, to make a determination on the legal issues
concerning State succession in respect to treaties which have been raised
by the Parties. Whether Bosnia and Herzegovina automatically became
party to the Genocide Convention on the date of its accession to inde-
pendence on 6 March 1992, or whether it became a party as a result —
retroactive or not — of its Notice of Succession of 29 December 1992, at
all events it was a party to it on the date of the filing of its Application
on 20 March 1993. These matters might, at the most, possess a certain
relevance with respect to the determination of the scope ratione temporis
of the jurisdiction of the Court, a point which the Court will consider
later (paragraph 34 below).

24. Yugoslavia has also contended, in its sixth preliminary objection,
that, if the Notice given by Bosnia and Herzegovina on 29 December
1992 had to be interpreted as constituting an instrument of accession
within the meaning of Article XI of the Genocide Convention, it could
only have become effective, pursuant to Article XIII of the Convention,
on the 90th day following its deposit, that is, 29 March 1993.

Since the Court has concluded that Bosnia and Herzegovina could
become a party to the Genocide Convention as a result of a succession,
the question of the application of Articles XI and XIII of the Convention
does not arise. However, the Court would recall that, as it noted in its
Order of 8 April 1993, even if Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be treated
as having acceded to the Genocide Convention, which would mean that
the Application could be said to be premature by nine days when filed on
20 March 1993, during the time elapsed since then, Bosnia and Herze-
govina could, on its own initiative, have remedied the procedural defect
by filing a new Application. It therefore matters little that the Applica-
tion had been filed some days too early. As will be indicated in the fol-
lowing paragraphs, the Court is not bound to attach the same degree of
importance to considerations of form as they might possess in domestic
law.

25. However, in the oral proceedings Yugoslavia submitted that, even
supposing that Bosnia and Herzegovina had been bound by the Conven-
tion in March 1993, it could not, at that time, have entered into force



between the Parties, because the two States did not recognize one another
and the conditions necessary to found the consensual basis of the Court’s
jurisdiction were therefore lacking. However, this situation no longer
obtains since the signature, and the entry into force on 14 December
1995, of the Dayton-Paris Agreement, Article X of which stipulates that:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina recognize each other as sovereign independent
States within their international borders. Further aspects of their
mutual recognition will be subject to subsequent discussions.”

26. For the purposes of determining its jurisdiction in this case, the
Court has no need to settle the question of what the effects of a situation
of non-recognition may be on the contractual ties between parties to a
multilateral treaty. It need only note that, even if it were to be assumed
that the Genocide Convention did not enter into force between the Parties
until the signature of the Dayton-Paris Agreement, all the conditions are
now fulfilled to found the jurisdiction of the Court ratione personae.

It is the case that the jurisdiction of the Court must normally be
assessed on the date of the filing of the act instituting proceedings. How-
ever, the Court, like its predecessor, the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice, has always had recourse to the principle according to
which it should not penalize a defect in a procedural act which the appli-
cant could easily remedy. Hence, in the case concerning the Mavromma-
tis Palestine Concessions, the Permanent Court said:

“Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was
based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an
adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant’s suit. The Court,
whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters
of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in
municipal law. Even, therefore, if the application were premature
because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this cir-
cumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the
necessary ratifications.” (P.C.L1J., Series A, No. 2, p. 34.)

The same principle lies at the root of the following dictum of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice in the case concerning Certain Ger-
man Interests in Polish Upper Silesia:

“Even if, under Article 23, the existence of a definite dispute were
necessary, this condition could at any time be fulfilled by means of
unilateral action on the part of the applicant Party. And the Court
cannot allow itself to be hampered by a mere defect of form, the
removal of which depends solely on the Party concerned.” (P.C.LJ.,
Series A, No. 6, p. 14.)

The present Court applied this principle in the case concerning the
Northern Cameroons (I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 28), as well as Military and



Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United
States of America) when it stated: “It would make no sense to require
Nicaragua now to institute fresh proceedings based on the Treaty, which
it would be fully entitled to do.” (I.C.J. Reports 1984, pp. 428-429,
para. 83.)

In the present case, even if it were established that the Parties, each of
which was bound by the Convention when the Application was filed, had
only been bound as between themselves with effect from 14 December
1995, the Court could not set aside its jurisdiction on this basis, inasmuch
as Bosnia and Herzegovina might at any time file a new application,
identical to the present one, which would be unassailable in this respect.

In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that it must reject
Yugoslavia’s third preliminary objection.

*

27. In order to determine whether it has jurisdiction to entertain the
case on the basis of Article IX of the Genocide Convention, it remains
for the Court to verify whether there is a dispute between the Parties that
falls within the scope of that provision. Article IX of the Convention is
worded as follows:

“Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpre-
tation, application or fulfilment of the present Convention, including
those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or for any
of the other acts enumerated in article III, shall be submitted to the
International Court of Justice at the request of any of the parties to
the dispute.”

It is jurisdiction ratione materiae, as so defined, to which Yugoslavia’s
fifth objection relates.

28. In their final form, the principal requests submitted by Bosnia and
Herzegovina are for the Court to adjudge and declare that Yugoslavia has
in several ways violated the Genocide Convention; to order Yugoslavia to
cease the acts contrary to the obligations stipulated in the Convention; and
to declare that Yugoslavia has incurred international responsibility by
reason of those violations, for which it must make appropriate reparation.
While Yugoslavia has refrained from filing a Counter-Memorial on the
merits and has raised preliminary objections, it has nevertheless wholly
denied all of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s allegations, whether at the stage of
proceedings relating to the requests for the indication of provisional meas-
ures, or at the stage of the present proceedings relating to those objections.

29. In conformity with well-established jurisprudence, the Court
accordingly notes that there persists

“a situation in which the two sides hold clearly opposite views
concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of
certain treaty obligations” (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with



Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion,
LC.J. Reports 1950, p. 74)

and that, by reason of the rejection by Yugoslavia of the complaints
formulated against it by Bosnia and Herzegovina, “there is a legal dis-
pute” between them (Fast Timor (Portugal v. Australia), T.C.J. Reports
1995, p. 100, para. 22).

30. To found its jurisdiction, the Court must, however, still ensure
that the dispute in question does indeed fall within the provisions of
Article IX of the Genocide Convention.

Yugoslavia disputes this. It contests the existence in this case of an
“international dispute” within the meaning of the Convention, basing
itself on two propositions: first, that the conflict occurring in certain
parts of the Applicant’s territory was of a domestic nature, Yugoslavia
was not party to it and did not exercise jurisdiction over that territory at
the time in question; and second, that State responsibility, as referred to
in the requests of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was excluded from the scope
of application of Article IX.

31. The Court will begin with a consideration of Yugoslavia’s first
proposition.

In doing so, it will start by recalling the terms of Article I of the Geno-
cide Convention, worded as follows:

“The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether commit-
ted in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international
law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.”

The Court sees nothing in this provision which would make the applica-
bility of the Convention subject to the condition that the acts contem-
plated by it should have been committed within the framework of a
particular type of conflict. The contracting parties expressly state therein
their willingness to consider genocide as “a crime under international
law”, which they must prevent and punish independently of the context
“of peace” or “of war” in which it takes place. In the view of the Court,
this means that the Convention is applicable, without reference to the cir-
cumstances linked to the domestic or international nature of the conflict,
provided the acts to which it refers in Articles II and III have been per-
petrated. In other words, irrespective of the nature of the conflict forming
the background to such acts, the obligations of prevention and punish-
ment which are incumbent upon the States parties to the Convention
remain identical.

As regards the question whether Yugoslavia took part — directly or
indirectly — in the conflict at issue, the Court would merely note that the
Parties have radically differing viewpoints in this respect and that it can-
not, at this stage in the proceedings, settle this question, which clearly
belongs to the merits.

Lastly, as to the territorial problems linked to the application of the
Convention, the Court would point out that the only provision relevant



to this, Article VI, merely provides for persons accused of one of the acts
prohibited by the Convention to “be tried by a competent tribunal of the
State in the territory of which the act was committed . . .”. It would also
recall its understanding of the object and purpose of the Convention, as
set out in its Opinion of 28 May 1951, cited above:

“The origins of the Convention show that it was the intention of
the United Nations to condemn and punish genocide as ‘a crime
under international law’ involving a denial of the right of existence
of entire human groups, a denial which shocks the conscience of
mankind and results in great losses to humanity, and which is con-
trary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations
(Resolution 96 (I) of the General Assembly, December 11th 1946).
The first consequence arising from this conception is that the prin-
ciples underlying the Convention are principles which are recognized
by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conven-
tional obligation. A second consequence is the universal character
both of the condemnation of genocide and of the co-operation
required ‘in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge’
(Preamble to the Convention).” (I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23.)

It follows that the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are
rights and obligations erga omnes. The Court notes that the obligation
each State thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not
territorially limited by the Convention.

32. The Court now comes to the second proposition advanced by Yugo-
slavia, regarding the type of State responsibility envisaged in Article IX
of the Convention. According to Yugoslavia, that Article would only
cover the responsibility flowing from the failure of a State to fulfil its obli-
gations of prevention and punishment as contemplated by Articles V,
VI and VII; on the other hand, the responsibility of a State for an act of
genocide perpetrated by the State itself would be excluded from the scope
of the Convention.

The Court would observe that the reference in Article IX to “the
responsibility of a State for genocide or for any of the other acts enumer-
ated in Article III”, does not exclude any form of State responsibility.

Nor is the responsibility of a State for acts of its organs excluded by
Article TV of the Convention, which contemplates the commission of an
act of genocide by “rulers” or “public officials”.

33. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that it must reject
the fifth preliminary objection of Yugoslavia. It would moreover observe
that it is sufficiently apparent from the very terms of that objection that
the Parties not only differ with respect to the facts of the case, their
imputability and the applicability to them of the provisions of the Geno-
cide Convention, but are moreover in disagreement with respect to the
meaning and legal scope of several of those provisions, including
Article IX. For the Court, there is accordingly no doubt that there
exists a dispute between them relating to “the interpretation, application or



fulfilment of the . . . Convention, including . . . the responsibility of a
State for genocide . . .”, according to the form of words employed by that
latter provision (cf. Applicability of the Obligation to Arbitrate under
Section 21 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 26 June
1947, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1988, pp. 27-32).

*

34. Having reached the conclusion that it has jurisdiction in the present
case, both ratione personae and ratione materiae on the basis of Ar-
ticle IX of the Genocide Convention, it remains for the Court to specify
the scope of that jurisdiction ratione ternporis. In its sixth and seventh
preliminary objections, Yugoslavia, basing its contention on the principle
of the non-retroactivity of legal acts, has indeed asserted as a subsidiary
argument that, even though the Court might have jurisdiction on the
basis of the Convention, it could only deal with events subsequent to the
different dates on which the Convention might have become applicable
as between the Parties. In this regard, the Court will confine itself to
the observation that the Genocide Convention — and in particular
Article IX — does not contain any clause the object or effect of which 1s
to limit in such manner the scope of its jurisdiction ratione temporis, and
nor did the Parties themselves make any reservation to that end, either to
the Convention or on the occasion of the signature of the Dayton-Paris
Agreement. The Court thus finds that it has jurisdiction in this case to
give effect to the Genocide Convention with regard to the relevant facts
which have occurred since the beginning of the conflict which took place
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This finding is, moreover, in accordance with
the object and purpose of the Convention as defined by the Court in 1951
and referred to above (see paragraph 31). As a result, the Court considers
that it must reject Yugoslavia’s sixth and seventh preliminary objections.

* *

35. After the filing of its Application, Bosnia and Herzegovina invoked
various additional bases of jurisdiction of the Court in the present case.
Even though, in both the written and oral proceedings, it relied essen-
tially upon Article IX of the Genocide Convention, Bosnia and Herze-
govina indicated that it was maintaining its claims in relation to those
additional grounds of jurisdiction. In particular, it specified at the hear-
ing that while it was renouncing “all the claims [set forth in its Applica-
tion] which are not directly linked to the genocide committed or abetted
by Yugoslavia”, those additional bases could nonetheless

“present a degree of interest, enabling the Court to make findings on
some of the means used by Yugoslavia to perpetrate the genocide of
which it stands accused, and particularly its recourse to a war of



aggression during which it seriously violated the 1949 Geneva
Conventions and the 1977 Protocols I and IT”;

and Bosnia and Herzegovina went on to say that “The Court might pro-
ceed in this way on the basis of Article IX alone”, explaining that

“The possibility of relying on other bases of jurisdiction . . . would
at least . . . avoid futile arguments between the Parties as to whether
such conduct is or is not linked ‘with sufficient directness’ to the
Convention.”

36. Yugoslavia, for its part, contended during the proceedings that the
Court could not take account of such additional grounds as could have
been referred to in the Application but to which no reference was in fact
made. However, in its final submissions, it did not reiterate that objection
and asked the Court, for the reasons there given, to declare that it lacked
jurisdiction on those grounds.

*

37. As the Court has indicated above (see paragraph 4), the Agent of
Bosnia and Herzegovina filed in the Registry, on 31 March 1993, the text
of a letter dated 8 June 1992 that was addressed to the President of the
Arbitration Commission of the International Conference for Peace in
Yugoslavia by Mr. Momir Bulatovié, President of the Republic of
Montenegro, and Mr. Slobodan Milosevié, President of the Republic of
Serbia. According to the English translation of that letter provided by
Bosnia and Herzegovina, they expressed the following views, infer alia:

“FR Yugoslavia holds the view that all legal disputes which
cannot be settled by agreement between FR Yugoslavia and the
former Yugoslav republics should be taken to the International
Court of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

Accordingly, and in view of the fact that all the issues raised in
your letter are of a legal nature, FR Yugoslavia proposes that in the
event that agreement is not reached among the participants in the
Conference, these questions should be adjudicated by the Interna-
tional Court of Justice, in accordance with its Statute.”

The Court finds that, given the circumstances in which that letter was
written and the declarations that ensued, it could not be taken as express-
ing an immediate commitment by the two Presidents, binding on Yugo-
slavia, to accept unconditionally the unilateral submission to the Court
of a wide range of legal disputes. It thus confirms the provisional conclu-
sion which it had reached in this regard in its Orders of 8 April (I.C.J.
Reports 1993, pp. 16-18, paras. 27-32) and 13 September 1993 (Z.C.J.
Reports 1993, pp. 340-341, para. 32); besides, no fundamentally new
argument has been presented to it on this matter since that time. It fol-



lows that the Court cannot find in that letter an additional basis of juris-
diction in the present case.

38. The Court has likewise recalled above (see paragraph 7) that, by a
communication dated 6 August 1993, the Agent of Bosnia and Herze-
govina indicated that his Government intended likewise to submit, as an
additional basis of jurisdiction, the Treaty between the Allied and Asso-
ciated Powers (the United States of America, the British Empire, France,
Italy and Japan) and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
that was signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 10 September 1919 and
entered into force on 16 July 1920. Chapter I of that Treaty concerns the
protection of minorities and includes an Article 11 according to which:

“The Serb-Croat-Slovene State agrees that any Member of the
Council of the League of Nations shall have the right to bring to the
attention of the Council any infraction, or any danger of infraction,
of any of these obligations, and that the Council may thereupon take
such action and give such directions as it may deem proper and
effective in the circumstances.

The Serb-Croat-Slovene State further agrees that any difference of
opinion as to questions of law or fact arising out of these Articles
between the Serb-Croat-Slovene State and any one of the Principal
Allied and Associated Powers or any other Power, a member of the
Council of the League of Nations, shall be held to be a dispute of
an international character under Article 14 of the Covenant of the
League of Nations. The Serb-Croat-Slovene State hereby consents
that any such dispute shall, if the other party thereto demands, be
referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The deci-
sion of the Permanent Court shall be final and shall have the same
force and effect as an award under Article 13 of the Covenant.”

Chapter II, which concerns succession in respect of treaties, trade, the
treatment of foreign vessels and freedom of transit, includes an Article 16
which provides, inter alia, that

“All rights and privileges accorded by the foregoing Articles to the
Allied and Associated Powers shall be accorded equally to all States
Members of the League of Nations.”

Bosnia and Herzegovina substantially contends that, by the effect of
those two provisions, any Member of the League of Nations could refer
to the Permanent Court a dispute to which Article 11 applied; that the
General Assembly of the United Nations has taken the place of the
Council of the League of Nations in respect of such matters; and that
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a Member of the United Nations, may now,
by operation of Article 37 of the Statute, seise the present Court of its
dispute with Yugoslavia, on the basis of the 1919 Treaty.

The Court considers that, in so far as Yugoslavia is now bound by the



1919 Treaty as successor to the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes, its obligations under that Treaty would be limited to its present
territory; it notes that Bosnia and Herzegovina has put forward no
claim in its Application concerning the treatment of minorities in Yugo-
slavia. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to uphold the 1919
Treaty as a basis on which its jurisdiction in this case could be founded.
On this point as well, the Court thus confirms the provisional conclusion
reached in its Order of 13 September 1993 (I. C.J. Reports 1993, pp. 339-
340, paras. 29-31); besides, no fundamentally new argument has been
presented on this matter either, since that time.

39. As the Court has also recalled above (see paragraph 7), Bosnia and
Herzegovina, by a letter from its Agent dated 10 August 1993, further
invoked as an additional basis of jurisdiction in the present case

“the Customary and Conventional International Laws of War and
International Humanitarian Law, including but not limited to the
Four Geneva Conventions of 1949, their First Additional Protocol
of 1977, the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare of 1907, and the
Nuremberg Charter, Judgment, and Principles”.

As it has already pointed out in its Order of 13 September 1993 (Z.C.J.
Reports 1993, p. 341, para. 33), the Court can find no provision relevant
to its jurisdiction in any of the above-mentioned instruments. It notes, in
addition, that the Applicant has made no further reference to this basis of
jurisdiction as such.

40. Lastly, at a later stage of the proceedings, Bosnia and Herzegovina
advanced two related arguments aimed at basing the Court’s jurisdiction
in this case on still other grounds.

According to the first of those arguments, Yugoslavia, by various
aspects of its conduct in the course of the incidental proceedings set in
motion by the requests for the indication of provisional measures, had
acquiesced in the jurisdiction of the Court on the basis of Article IX of
the Genocide Convention. As the Court has already reached the conclu-
sion that it has jurisdiction on the basis of that provision, it need no
longer consider that question.

According to the second argument, as Yugoslavia, on 1 April 1993,
itself called for the indication of provisional measures some of which
were aimed at the preservation of rights not covered by the Genocide
Convention, it was said, in accordance with the doctrine of forum proro-
gatum (stricto sensu), to have given its consent to the exercise by the
Court, in the present case, of a wider jurisdiction than that provided for
in Article IX of the Convention. Given the nature of both the provisional
measures subsequently requested by Yugoslavia on 9 August 1993 —
which were aimed exclusively at the preservation of rights conferred by



the Genocide Convention — and the unequivocal declarations whereby
Yugoslavia consistently contended during the subsequent proceedings
that the Court lacked jurisdiction — whether on the basis of the Geno-
cide Convention or on any other basis — the Court finds that it must
confirm the provisional conclusion that it reached on that subject in its
Order of 13 September 1993 (I. C.J. Reports 1993, pp. 341-342, para. 34).
The Court does not find that the Respondent has given in this case a
“voluntary and indisputable” consent (see Corfu Channel, Preliminary
Objection, Judgment, 1948, L.C.J. Reports 1947-1948, p. 27) which would
confer upon it a jurisdiction exceeding that which it has already acknow-
ledged to have been conferred upon it by Article IX of the Genocide
Convention.

of Yugoslavia that relate to the admissibility of the Application.

®

43. According to the first preliminary objection of Yugoslavia, the
Application is said to be inadmissible on the ground that it refers to
events that took place within the framework of a civil war, and there is
consequently no international dispute upon which the Court could make
a finding.

This objection is very close to the fifth objection which the Court has
already considered (paragraphs 27-33). In responding to the latter objec-
tion, the Court has in fact also answered this. Having noted that there
does indeed exist between the Parties a dispute falling within the provi-
sions of Article IX of the Genocide Convention — that is to say an inter-
national dispute —, the Court cannot find that the Application is inad-
missible on the sole ground that, in order to decide the dispute, it would
be impelled to take account of events that may have occurred in a context
of civil war. It follows that the first objection of Yugoslavia must be
rejected.

44. According to the second objection of Yugoslavia, the Application
is inadmissible because, as Mr. Alija Izetbegovié was not serving as Presi-
dent of the Republic — but only as President of the Presidency — at the



time at which he granted the authorization to initiate proceedings, that
authorization was granted in violation of certain rules of domestic law of
fundamental significance. Yugoslavia likewise contended that Mr. Izet-
begovi¢ was not even acting legally at that time as President of the Presi-
dency.

The Court does not, in order to rule on that objection, have to con-
sider the provisions of domestic law which were invoked in the course of
the proceedings either in support of or in opposition to that objection.
According to international law, there is no doubt that every Head of
State is presumed to be able to act on behalf of the State in its interna-
tional relations (see for example the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, Art. 7, para. 2 (a)). As the Court found in its Order of 8 April
1993 (I.C.J. Reports 1993, p. 11, para. 13), at the time of the filing of the
Application, Mr. Izetbegovié was recognized, in particular by the United
Nations, as the Head of State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, his
status as Head of State continued subsequently to be recognized in many
international bodies and several international agreements — including
the Dayton-Paris Agreement — bear his signature. It follows that the
second preliminary objection of Yugoslavia must also be rejected.

45. The Court concludes from the foregoing that the Application filed
by Bosnia and Herzegovina on 20 March 1993 is admissible.

46. The Court has taken note of the withdrawal of the fourth prelimi-
nary objection of Yugoslavia and has rejected the other preliminary
objections. In conclusion, the Court emphasizes that in so doing it does
not consider that Yugoslavia has, in presenting those objections, abused
its rights to do so under Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute of the
Court and Article 79 of the Rules of Court. The Court rejects the request
made to that end by Bosnia and Herzegovina in its final submissions. The
Court must, in each case submitted to it, verify whether it has jurisdiction
to deal with the case, and, if necessary, whether the Application is admis-
sible, and such objections as are raised by the Respondent may be useful
to clarify the legal situation. As matters now stand, the preliminary
objections presented by Yugoslavia have served that purpose. Having
established its jurisdiction under Article IX of the Genocide Convention,
and having concluded that the Application is admissible, the Court may
now proceed to consider the merits of the case on that basis.
