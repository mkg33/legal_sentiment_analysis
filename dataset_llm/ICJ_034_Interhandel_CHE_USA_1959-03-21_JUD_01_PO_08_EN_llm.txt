after the local remedies have been exhausted. In my view, there
being before the Court no valid declaration of acceptance of its
jurisdiction and no voluntary submission to it, the Court is not in
a position to exercise any kind of jurisdiction over this case, in-
cluding that of declaring the claim to be inadmissible. The same—
subject to one exception—applies to its jurisdiction to decide on
any of the preliminary objections. That exception arises from the
objection based on the so-called automatic reservation which
- peremptorily and decisively rules out any jurisdiction of the Court
with regard to a crucial aspect of the dispute and which renders the
other objections irrelevant. That objection also necessarily involves
the question of the validity of the Declaration of Acceptance of the
defendant State. :

the part of the United States, as well as upon its own Declaration of
Acceptance of July 28th, 1948. Paragraph 2 (8) of the Declaration of
Acceptance of the United States provided that the Declaration shall
not apply to “disputes with regard to matters which are essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States of America as
determined by the United States of America”.

In its Preliminary Objections the Government of the United
States invoked the reservation thus formulated. It stated there,
in Part (a) of the Fourth Preliminary Objection, as follows:

“(a) The sale or disposition by the Government of the United
States of America of the stock in General Aniline & Film Corpo-
ration, vested as enemy assets under the United States Trading
with the Enemy Act, has been determined by the United States
of America, pursuant to paragraph (b) of the Conditions attached
to this country’s acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction
to be a matter essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the
United States. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (5) of the said
Conditions, the United States of America respectfully declines to
submit to the jurisdiction of the Court the matter of the sale or
disposition of such shares, including the passing of good and clear
title to any person or entity. Such determination by the United
States of America that the sale or disposition by the Government
of the United States of the stock in General Aniline & Film Corpo-
ration is a matter essentially within its domestic jurisdiction applies
to all the issues raised in the Swiss Application and Memorial,
including, but not limited to, the Swiss-United States Treaty of
Arbitration and Conciliation of 1931 and the Washington Accord
of 1946.”

States has invoked the automatic reservation only in the matter of
the sale and disposition of the assets of Interhandel, but not
with regard to certain other aspects of the dispute, in particular the
legality of the original seizure of the assets of the Company. The
Government of the United States has, in repeated statements,
attached importance to that limitation of its reliance on the
“automatic reservation”. However, it does not appear that any
such differentiation corresponds to the terms or objects of the
application of the Swiss Government or that it is of decisive prac-
tical or legal importance. The Swiss Application asks the Court to
declare and adjudicate that the “Government of the United States
of America is under an obligation to restore the assets of Inter-
handel”. Now it is clear that if the Government of the United States,
in reliance upon the automatic reservation, proceeds to sell or
otherwise to dispose of the assets of Interhandel, notwith-
standing any judgment of or proceedings before this Court, it will
not be in the position “to restore the assets” of Interhandel.
It may, in pursuance of any judgment of the Court, offer to pay
compensation in place of the assets to be restored. Yet that is not
the object of the Swiss Application which asks for the restoration
of the assets—with the concomitant and, in the estimation of the
Swiss Government, essential rights of control over the affairs of
Interhandel.

In view of this, no decisive importance attaches to the fact that
the Government of the United States has refrained from invoking

Moreover, in so far as there arises in the present case the question
of the validity of the automatic reservation and of the Declaration
as a whole—and it is these questions which inevitably call for an
answer before the Court can in any way assume jurisdiction in the
matter, even to the extent of deciding on the other preliminary
objections—it seems immaterial whether the automatic reservation
covers all or merely one aspect of the case.

The same considerations apply to the alternative request and
conclusion of the Swiss Government, namely, that relating to the
obligation of the United States to submit the dispute to the pro-
cedures of arbitration or conciliation. As the Preliminary Objection
4 (a)—the objection which invokes the automatic reservation—
of the United States is specifically stated to apply also to the ques-
tion of arbitration and conciliation, it is impossible for the Court to
~ declare itself competent to decide on that aspect of the Swiss

Application without assuming a position in relation to the validity
of the automatic reservation and of the Declaration of Acceptance
as such. If that reservation is effective then it is impossible for
the Court to declare that the United States is bound to submit the
entire dispute to arbitration er conciliation for in that case—that
is to say, if the automatic reservation is valid—an arbitration
tribunal or conciliation commission has no power to decide or to
make recommendations on the main Swiss Application and Con-
clusion, namely, the obligation of the United States to restore the
assets of Interhandel. The Court can assume jurisdiction with
regard to the obligation of arbitration or conciliation only on the
assumption that the reservation in question is ineffective and
invalid or that it has been unreasonably invoked and must therefore
be disregarded for these reasons or at least that it is within the
power of the arbitration tribunal or conciliation commission to
disregard that reservation on these grounds. The same applies, for
reasons which will be stated presently, to the request to join this
aspect of the dispute to the merits. The Court cannot, at any stage
of the proceedings, act without regard to the instrument which
purports to confer jurisdiction upon it or, for reasons outside the
realm of legal considerations, postpone a decision on the subject.

Neither can the Court consider itself to be relieved of that duty
for the reason that the Government which has made the automatic

submission of the Government of Switzerland that that objection
be joined to the merits. The objection based on the automatic
reservation cannot be properly joined to merits for the reason that
being of a formal and peremptory character, namely, being depen-


I00 INTERHANDEL (DISS. OP. SIR HERSCH LAUTERPACHT)

dent solely upon the determination by the United States, it cannot
by definition be examined upon its merits in relation to the substance
of the dispute. For it operates automatically, irrespective of the
merits of the dispute, by its own propulsion—as it were—as the
result of the physical act of having been invoked. This is so unless
the Court decides, at the very first stage of the proceedings, that
the question of the reasonableness and good faith of the reliance
on the automatic reservation must in any case be within the juris-
diction of the Court. For these reasons, the Court has, in my view,
no power to declare itself competent to consider, either directly or
by joining it to the merits, the subsidiary request of the Swiss
Government relating to the obligation of the United States of
America in the matter of arbitration or conciliation until it has
decided that the automatic reservation is invalid, and cannot be
acted upon, or that, if valid, the Court has the power to pass in
every individual case upon the propriety of the action of the
Government which invokes it. For, as noted, the Government of
the United States has expressly declared that the objection based
on the automatic reservation applies also to the question of arbi-
tration and conciliation. The Court cannot properly declare itself
competent or, by joining the objection to the merits, envisage such
competence, without examining the principal and fundamental
questions decisive for the very possibility of its competence.

In my judgment, there is not before the Court a legally effective
and valid Declaration of Acceptance by reference to which it is in
the position to assume jurisdiction with regard to any aspect of
the dispute or by reference to which it is incumbent upon it—or
permissible for it—to examine any preliminary objection other
than that relying upon the automatic reservation. In my view, the
Government of the United States, having in its Declaration of
Acceptance of August 26th, 1946, purported to accept the jurisdiction
of the Court subject to the reservation of matters essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of the United States as determined by
the Government of the United States, did not, in legal effect,
become a party to an instrument which confers upon it rights
and which imposes upon it obligations. This is so for the following
reasons:

of the applicant Government. In that case the Court in refraining
from entering into the question of the validity of the automatic
reservation and of the Declaration of Acceptance attached import-
ance to the fact that these questions were not put in issue by
either Party. In my Separate Opinion in that case I expressed
the view that the validity of the instrument invoked as a basis
of the jurisdiction of the Court must be a matter for the decision
of the Court proprio motu regardless of whether that issue has
been raised by the parties (I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 61). In the pre-

In the Separate Opinion in the Norwegian Loans case I stated (on
P- 43) as follows my view that it was not open to the Court to act
upon the “automatic” reservation:

“I consider it legally impossible for the Court to act in disregard
of its Statute which imposes upon it the duty and confers upon it
the right to determine its jurisdiction. That right cannot be exercised
by a party to the dispute. The Court cannot, in any circumstances,
treat as admissible the claim that the parties have accepted its
jurisdiction subject to the condition that they, and not the Court,
will decide on its jurisdiction. To do so is in my view contrary to
Article 36 (6) of the Statute which, without any qualification,
confers upon the Court the right and imposes upon it the duty to
determine its jurisdiction. Moreover, it is also contrary to Article 1
of the Statute of the Court and Article gz of the Charter of the
United Nations which lay down that the Court shall function in
accordance with the provisions of its Statute.”

The Court is the guardian of its Statute. It is not within its
power to abandon, in deference to a reservation made by a party, a
function which by virtue of an express provision of the Statute is an
essential safeguard of its compulsory jurisdiction. This is so in
particular in view of the fact that the principle enshrined in Article
36 (6) of the Statute is declaratory of one of the most firmly estab-
lished principles of international arbitral and judicial practice.
That principle is that, in the matter of its jurisdiction, an inter-
national tribunal, and not the interested party, has the power of
decision whether the dispute before it is covered by the instrument
creating its jurisdiction.

free choice. A person or a State may be free to join an association
or to accede to a treaty. This does not mean that they are entitled
to join or accede on their own terms in disregard of the rules of the
association or of the provisions of the treaty. Governments possess
no unlimited right to make reservations. In the Advisory Opinion on
the Reservations to the Genocide Convention the Court rejected the
contention that the unanimous consent of all parties to the treaty
is necessary to enable the State to become a party to the treaty sub-
ject to a reservation. But the Court equally declined to accept the
view that the right to append reservations is unlimited. On the
contrary, it made ‘‘the compatibility of a reservation with the
object and purpose of the Convention” the decisive test of their
admissibility (I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 24). It said: “The object and
purpose of the Convention thus limit both the freedom of making
reservations and that of objecting to them” (at p. 24). It is for that
reason that while most of the recent conventions allow reservations
to their articles, they expressly exclude them with regard to some

alike to all instruments, whether bilateral or unilateral, intended
to create legal rights and obligations. The only elaboration that
is required in this connection of that view is that dictated by the
fact that the automatic reservation now before the Court is one
incorporated in the Declaration of Acceptance of the United States
of America.

The insistence on the right of unilateral determination of the
existence of a legal obligation to submit a dispute to arbitral or
judicial settlement has been the unvarying feature of the practice
of the United States and, in particular, of the branch of the Govern-
ment of the United States endowed by the Constitution with the
power of decisive participation in the process of ratification of
treaties. Although occasionally, in treaties other than treaties
providing generally for compulsory arbitral or judicial settlement,
the United States of America has accepted in advance the juris-
diction of international tribunals in the matter of the interpretation
and the application of those treaties, including necessarily those
relating to the jurisdiction of those tribunals to determine their
competence when acting in that capacity, it has been unwilling to
do so with regard to treaties providing generally for obligatory
arbitral or judicial settlement. With regard to those treaties the
consistent attitude of the legislative body entrusted by the Con-



stitution with advising and consenting to ratification has been to

the beginning of the modern practice of compulsory arbitration at
the end of the nineteenth century, to associate the United States
of America with the practice of compulsory judicial and arbitral
settlement.

On January 11th, 1897, a general treaty of arbitration was signed
between the United States of America and Great Britain containing
provisions for the adjudication of disputes concerning pecuniary
claims against either Party and controversies involving the deter-
mination of “territorial claims”. Provisions of some stringency
surrounded both groups of disputes. Thus with regard to territorial
claims it was laid down that disputes shall be submitted to a
tribunal composed of six members, three of whom were to be judges
of the Supreme Court of the United States or of the circuit courts



and the other three were to be judges of the British Supreme Court
of Judicature or members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council. It was laid down that only an award given by a majority
of not less than five to one was to be final (unless within three
months either party protested against it). Moreover, it was provided
that, in case one of the tribunals, constituted for the decision of
matters not involving the determination of territorial claims, should
decide that the determination of the case before it necessarily
involved “the decision of a disputed question of principle of grave
general importance affecting the national rights of such party as
distinguished from the private rights whereof it is merely the inter-
national representative”, the jurisdiction of the tribunal should
cease and the case should “be dealt with in the same manner as
if it involved the determination of a territorial claim” (Moore,
A Digest of International Law, Vol. VII (1906), p. 77). Notwith-
standing these safeguards the Senate declined to give its consent
to the treaty.

treaties but substituted the term ‘‘treaty’—requiring the consent
of two-thirds of the Senate—for “agreement” in relation to the
requirement of special agreement; it struck out the provisions
relating to determination of the matter by the Joint Commission.
Thereupon the Government of the United States abstained from
proceeding with the ratification of those treaties (S. Doc. 476;
62nd Congress, 1st and 2nd Sessions).

On occasions the power of final decision on the part of the Senate
has been reserved even in bilateral treaties limited to arbitral

with Switzerland of February 16th, 1931—which, while invariably
incorporating the reservation of matters which are “within the
domestic jurisdiction of either of the Contracting Parties”, provided
at the same time for the necessity of a special agreement in each
case. Such agreement was ‘‘in each case [to] be made on the part of
the United States of America by the President thereof, by and
with the advice and consent of Senate”.

On January 5th, 1929, the United States of America signed the
General Treaty of Inter-American Arbitration—a treaty which
contained the reservation relating to disputes “which are within

III INTERHANDEL (DISS. OP. SIR HERSCH LAUTERPACHT)

À similar limitation has been incorporated in a number of bilateral
agreements relating to specific matters, such as economic aid.
Thus the Treaty of July 3rd, 1948, between the United States and
China relating to economic aid provides as follows:

“It is understood that the undertaking of each Government
{relating to the jurisdiction of the Court] … is limited by the terms
and conditions of such effective recognition as it has heretofore

No assistance can be derived in this respect from the suggestion
that, in deciding whether a matter is essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction, the Court shall assume that, unless there
are obvious reasons to the contrary, the Government in question
has made the determination reasonably and in good faith. Even
assuming that a differentiation between a determination which is
wrong, one whichis obviously and unreasonably wrong, and one which,
although unreasonable, is not arbitrarily and abusively so, provides
a proper basis for judicial decision in a matter affecting the juris-
diction of the Court itself, the fact remains that the United States
of America has not conceded to the Court—that it has expressly

the defence efforts and war-time needs of the United States of
America; that the law of the United States (the Trading with the
Enemy Act) empowers the President to vest the property of
Interhandel, to sell or liquidate it in the interests of and for the

jurisdiction—coupled in the case of the United States with a uniform


II4 INTERHANDEL (DISS. OP. SIR HERSCH LAUTERPACHT)

insistence on the right of unilateral determination—that right
assumes in effect the complexion of an absolute right not subject
to review by the Court. This might not necessarily be the case if,
for instance, a government were to make a reservation of matters
arising in the course of hostilities as determined by that govern-
ment and if subsequently it were to proceed to determine as such

the Court is based invariably on the consent of the parties, given
in advance or in relation to a particular dispute. Admittedly, once
that consent has been given the Court will not allow the obligation
thus undertaken, or the effectiveness of that obligation, to be
defeated by technicalities or evasion. Thus the Court has assumed
jurisdiction by virtue of implied consent through so-called forum
provogatum ; on occasions, in order to make its jurisdiction effective,
it has declared itself competent to award compensation in cases in

of legal obligation. The Court being a legal tribunal cannot apply
what, as a matter of legal effect, is essentially no more than a
declaration of principle and of general willingness to submit disputes
to the jurisdiction of the Court.



Attention has been drawn in this connection to the protestations,
the sincerity of which is open neither to examination nor doubt,
that the faculty of determination would not be used capriciously
but with due regard to the reputation and the traditions of the

making it, is essential to and goes to the roots of the main obligation,
cannot be separated from it. This is not a mere refinement of
private law, or of any municipal system thereof, but—as all general
principles of law—a maxim based on common sense and equity.
A party cannot be held to be bound by an obligation divested of



a condition without which that obligation would never have been
undertaken,

whole—are squarely before the Court. There may be reasons
militating in favour of postponing a decision holding that that



particular Declaration of Acceptance—and, by necessary impli-
cation, similar Declarations of Acceptance—are ineffective in law
whether invoked by or against the declaring State. However, these
are not reasons of a legal nature.

There is a further additional factor of decisive importance which,

which purports to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court
but which, in law, fails to do it for the reason that it leaves it to
the State concerned to determine whether a particular dispute is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.

Neither is there any sanction involved in treating such a Decla-
ration of Acceptance as legally non-existent. For it operates equally

dissent from the Judgment of the Court, I have come to the con-
clusion that, having regard to the invalidity of the automatic
reservation and, consequently, of the Declaration of Acceptance
as a whole, the scope of a jurisdictional judgment of the Court in
the present case must be reduced to a minimum. The Court is not
in a position to act negatively by declining jurisdiction on account
of Objections 1 and 2 (the Objections rafione temporis) and
Objection 4 (b) (relating to matters alleged, but not determined, by
the United States of America to be within its domestic jurisdiction).
For any such negative decision presupposes the existence of a valid
Declaration of Acceptance in relation to which jurisdictional ob-
jections can be examined, and answered. For the same reason the
Court cannot declare the Application to be inadmissible on account
of non-exhaustion of local remedies. Moreover, any such declaration
of inadmissibility implies admissibility after local remedies have
been exhausted—a contingency which cannot properly be contem- -
plated on the basis of the existing Declaration of Acceptance of the
United States of America. The only course which, in my opinion,
is properly open to the Court is to hold that in view of the invalidity
of the automatic reservation and the consequent invalidity of the
Declaration of Acceptance there is not before it an instrument by
reference to which it can assume jurisdiction in relation to any
aspect of the dispute. These consequences may seem to be startling.
However, they appear to be so only if we disregard the nature and
the contents of the instrument by reference to which the jurisdic-
tion of the Court is here being invoked.



I have concurred in it with regard to the first and second Objections
ratione temporis. On the other hand, I would have been in favour of
joining to the merits the third Objection, relating to the exhaustion
of local remedies, in so far as it bears upon the principal claim for
the restitution of the assets of Interhandel. In this respect I concur
generally in the reasons expressed in the dissenting opinions of
President Klaestad and Judge Armand-Ugon.

I have also been unable to associate myself with the decision hold-
ing that the subsidiary claim of the Government of Switzerland relat-
ing to the obligation of the United States to submit the dispute
to arbitration or conciliation is inadmissible on account of the non-
exhaustion of local remedies by Interhandel. I cannot accept the
contention of the United States that the demand for restitution
which forms the subject-matter of the Swiss Application and which,
in substance, is now being litigated before the Courts of the United
States and the demand by the Swiss Government for arbitration
and conciliation are essentially one dispute. I consider that with
regard to that aspect of the claim of Switzerland there apply, with
some cogency, the principles which are now firmly rooted in the
jurisprudence of the Court and which were clearly expressed in the
Judgment of the Permanent Court in the Chorzdw Factory case
(Series A, No. 17, p. 28). The Court said there:

“... The rules of law governing the reparation are the rules of
international law in force between the two States concerned, and
not the law governing relations between the State which has com-
mitted a wrongful act and the individual who has suffered damage.
Rights or interests of an individual the violation of which rights
causes damage are always in a different plane to rights belonging
to a State, which rights may also be infringed by the same act.
The damage suffered by an individual is never therefore identical
in kind with that which will be suffered by a State; it can only
afford a convenient scale for the calculation of the reparation due
to the State.”

There must exist weighty reasons for any departure from that

Moreover, the Judgments of the Court in the Ambatielos case
(I.C.T. Reports 1952, p. 44, and 1953, p. 18) were based on the
proposition that, in deciding whether the Court is competent to


I21 INTERHANDEL (Diss. OP. SIR HERSCH LAUTERPACHT)

determine whether a State is under an obligation to submit a
dispute to arbitration, this Court will not anticipate the decision of
that tribunal on any question dividing the Parties. Thus, the arbi-
tration tribunal may have views of its own on the extent of the obli-
gation, in the present case, to comply with the rule of exhaustion
of local remedies. This being so, it would seem to follow from the
Judgments in the Ambatielos case and from general considerations
that that question must be left to the decision of the arbitra-
tion tribunal and that the Court ought not to decline to consider
the request of Switzerland on the subject on the ground that local
remedies have not been exhausted.

Finally, in so far as the procedure of conciliation is concerned,
it must not be taken for granted that the legal requirement of
exhaustion of local remedies would be fully or invariably applied
by a conciliation commission which is not bound to proceed ex-
clusively on the basis of law.
