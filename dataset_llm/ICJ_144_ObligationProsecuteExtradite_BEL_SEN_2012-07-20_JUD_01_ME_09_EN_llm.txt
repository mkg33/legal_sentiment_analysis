                    The decision relies on the reasoning of an advisory opinion rather than that of
                 the settlement of a dispute — Jurisdiction of the Court — Subject‑matter and
                 critical date of the dispute are not sufficiently determined by the Court ; doubts as
                 to the satisfaction of the precondition that it has proved impossible to organize
                 arbitration ; unfounded refusal of the Court to examine the dispute relating to
                 customary rules — Admissibility of Belgium’s Application — Irrelevance of
                 Belgium’s passive criminal jurisdiction : the Court should have ruled on that point ;
                 absence of an obligation erga omnes partes on which Belgium’s Application could
                 be founded ; inadmissibility of the said Application — Merits — Senegal’s breach
                 of Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Convention against Torture ; disappearance of the
                 dispute relating to Article 5 of the Convention ; no breach of Article 7, paragraph 1,
                 by Senegal ; Senegal has a permanent obligation to refer the case to its competent
                 authorities for the purpose of prosecution ; Belgium is not entitled to obtain
                 extradition from Senegal on the basis of the Convention : regrettable silence of the
                 operative clause on this point.

                    2. The general purpose of this opinion is to raise a question mark over
                 the way in which the Court has conceived of its task, which is to settle a
                 legal dispute between States in accordance with international law. I won-
                 der if the Court has not in fact set about responding to a request for an
                 advisory opinion on the nature and authority of the Convention against
                 Torture, rather than examining in a fair and balanced way the arguments
                 and conduct of the Parties.
                    3. On the other hand, of course, some opinions are not unlike indirect
                 settlements of unspoken or implicit disputes, and the Court’s advisory
                 role is as much a part of its judicial mission as its role in contentious
                 cases. However, the fact remains that a judicial settlement is only a sub-
                 stitute for a diplomatic one, and in my view it must offer a full, balanced
                 and clear response to all of the parties’ arguments and claims. This is
                 especially important given the non‑compulsory nature of the Court’s
                 jurisdiction and the need for the parties to trust that their views have been
                 heard and taken into consideration.
                    4. In this case, it is my impression that the Court had to work as
                 quickly as possible and that, so long as a majority was achieved in respect
                 of the solution adopted, the reasoning was of lesser importance, except in
                 order to confirm certain principles — the Court’s interpretation of which
                 seems to be as hurried as it is lacking in legal basis — relating to the Con-
                 vention against Torture. The Court appears to have given itself the task




6 CIJ1033.indb 371                                                                                        28/11/13 12:50

                          obligation to prosecute or extradite (diss. op. sur)              606

                 of stating the law, if not making the law in an abstract and general way,
                 in order to ensure its prime position at the heart of the international legal
                 system. By way of example, let us take the reference to jus cogens which
                 appears in the reasoning, a reference which is entirely superfluous and
                 does not contribute to the settlement of the dispute, as will be seen. The
                 purpose of this obiter dictum is to acknowledge and give legal weight to a
                 disputed notion, whose substance has yet to be established. Thus, the dis-
                 pute is used for other ends, namely as a starting‑point for further devel-
                 opments outside of its scope.

                    6. Senegal did not raise preliminary objections, and so the questions
                 relating to jurisdiction were ruled on at the same time as the merits. Bel-
                 gium relied on both Article 30 of the Convention against Torture — an
                 arbitral and judicial settlement clause — and the joint effect of the unilat-
                 eral declarations of acceptance by the two Parties of the optional jurisdic-
                 tion of the Court. In my view, there are three questions which were neither
                 examined nor resolved satisfactorily by the Judgment. The first relates to
                 the subject‑matter of the dispute and its critical date ; the second to the
                 precondition that the recourse to arbitration provided for in Article 30 of
                 the Convention has proved impossible ; and the third to the Court’s juris-
                 diction in relation to the customary rules invoked by Belgium.

                               Subject‑Matter and Critical Date of the Dispute
                    7. In fact, the Court has not adopted a position on these points and
                 thus some aspects remain up in the air. Subject‑matter and critical date
                 are linked to the extent that the dispute derives from a request made by
                 one party to the other, to which the latter refuses to accede. These requests
                 may evolve, in such a way that the resulting dispute may also change :
                 parts of it may be resolved and parts may persist ; certain aspects may
                 even be altered in some measure. That is why it is necessary for the Court
                 to fix the critical date of the dispute at the same time as its subject‑matter,
                 or to indicate all of the critical dates which may exist across the various
                 stages of a dispute which is still evolving.
                    8. So, what is the subject‑matter of the dispute ? Does it concern the
                 interpretation of the Convention against Torture, as claimed by Belgium
                 and rejected by Senegal ? Belgium contends that the Convention obliges
                 Senegal to establish its criminal jurisdiction so that it may try persons
                 suspected of violating the Convention who are present in its territory ; to
                 immediately make an inquiry into the facts invoked ; and to submit the
                 case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, if it does





6 CIJ1033.indb 373                                                                                 28/11/13 12:50

                          obligation to prosecute or extradite (diss. op. sur)               607

                 not extradite the individual concerned. Belgium considers that Senegal
                 has breached these four obligations by failing to amend in a timely man-
                 ner its domestic criminal legislation ; by failing to make the necessary pre-
                 liminary inquiry ; by failing to submit the case to its competent authorities ;
                 and by failing to extradite Hissène Habré — the successive requests made
                 to this end all having been rejected by the Senegalese courts to which they
                 were referred. In particular, Belgium claims that it has a right to demand
                 that Senegal perform these obligations and to invoke the latter’s respon-
                 sibility if it fails to do so.
                    9. Beyond that direct right which is claimed by Belgium, Senegal does
                 not dispute any of these obligations in principle. It has continually stated
                 that it is committed to organizing the trial of Hissène Habré ; it advises
                 Belgium to re‑issue its extradition request so that it complies with Senega-
                 lese law ; and it points out that its domestic rules, both constitutional and
                 legislative, have been modified to allow for a trial to be held in Senegal. It
                 considers that the approaches it has made to the regional African authori­
                 ties so as to receive help with the organization of a trial do not constitute
                 an abandonment of its efforts to institute proceedings, especially given
                 the fact that Belgium has itself supported these efforts with the promise of
                 financial assistance.
                    10. A priori, therefore, the dispute does not concern the interpretation
                 of the Convention since, rightly or wrongly, both States appear to agree
                 on the content of the obligations contained therein — to prosecute or
                 extradite. But are they correct, when the Convention simply requires that
                 the case be submitted to the competent authorities for the purpose of
                 prosecution and when, as the Court correctly points out, it is not estab-
                 lished that prosecution and extradition are alternatives, or that the two
                 should be given equal weight ? If we accept this interpretation, however,
                 which both Parties seem to share, there is no dispute between them, but
                 there is one over an alleged delay by Senegal in the implementation and
                 performance of these obligations. This is a question on the merits and, to
                 some extent, involves an assessment of the relevant facts and conduct, to
                 which I shall return later. Such is not the view taken by the Court, which
                 adopts its own definition of the dispute, although it fails to set out exactly
                 what that definition is and proceeds to examine aspects of the dispute
                 without first having clearly identified it, together with its critical date or
                 successive critical dates.

                 measures was examined, and 2012, the year of the Judgment. In 2009, I
                 believed that the dispute no longer had any object, since Senegal had con-
                 firmed that it was committed to organizing a trial and to exercising its
                 criminal jurisdiction in accordance with the Convention, either by sub-
                 mitting the case to its domestic courts or by working towards the creation
                 of an ad hoc tribunal. Three years later, those efforts have been unsuccess-
                 ful. It is legitimate, therefore, to question the reasons for this delay. In the
                 light of this, it is my view that a dispute does exist. However, keeping to





6 CIJ1033.indb 375                                                                                  28/11/13 12:50

                          obligation to prosecute or extradite (diss. op. sur)               608

                 the Parties’ common position, that dispute seems to concern, a priori, the
                 application of the Convention against Torture and Senegal’s delay in this
                 respect, rather than its interpretation.

                 the Convention. Rather than defining the dispute in general terms, the
                 Court considers it in parts. This leads it to find, for example, that the part
                 of the dispute relating to Senegal’s failure to establish its criminal juris-
                 diction in respect of suspects present in its territory ended in 2007, on the
                 date of the adoption of the measures concerned. It implicitly dismisses
                 another part of the dispute — that relating to the financial difficulties
                 mentioned by Senegal — since Senegal has never invoked these as justifi-
                 cation for a breach of its obligations. However, the Court substitutes the
                 Parties’ apparently convergent positions with its own interpretation of the
                 Convention against Torture in respect of at least two points : first with
                 regard to the erga omnes partes character of the obligations laid down in

                 tion to submit the case to the competent authorities for the purpose of
                 prosecution and the obligation to extradite. In so doing, it departs from
                 the Parties’ reasoning in order to develop its own interpretation. Thus,
                 although the Court relies on a difference of interpretation, it is in fact its
                 interpretation which differs from that of the Parties, rather than the Par-
                 ties’ interpretations which differ from each other.
                    13. The Court is perfectly founded in so doing, since it falls to it to deter-
                 mine the subject‑matter of the dispute. Nevertheless, I am far from con-
                 vinced by the interpretation that the Convention establishes an erga omnes
                 partes obligation to submit the case to the competent authorities for the
                 purpose of prosecution. What is more, it seems to me that this interpreta-
                 tion is either a deliberate tactic to establish the admissibility of a question-
                 able Belgian Application, or a means of achieving an end other than the

                 the status of an erga omnes norm. The two things may even go hand‑in‑hand :
                 one being the object of a sort of sacralization of the Convention, the other
                 being the means by which to achieve it. It is in this respect in particular that
                 the Court’s reasoning seems to me to be more like that of an advisory opin-
                 ion, abstract and general in its application, than that of the settlement of an
                 individual dispute limited to specific States. In that context, establishing the
                 exact nature of the dispute and its critical date or dates becomes of second-
                 ary importance. I shall return to this point in connection with the merits,
                 since the critical date or dates determine how Senegal’s delay in the imple-
                 mentation of the Convention is assessed.

                                                   Arbitration

                 nize arbitration between the Parties, has not been met in this instance. It





6 CIJ1033.indb 377                                                                                   28/11/13 12:50


                 simply observes that Belgium made known to Senegal that it wished to
                 have recourse to arbitration and that this request went unanswered, Sen-
                 egal merely taking note of it. It is true that this rejection of Senegal’s
                 argument is in keeping with earlier jurisprudence and that the Court is
                 not formalistic on this point. Regrettably so, perhaps, since a minimal
                 amount of formalism would avoid any ambiguity in the matter. When the
                 Court sets out Belgium’s approaches on the subject of arbitration, it attri-
                 butes to them a continuity, coherence and clarity that is far from evident
                 in the documents furnished to the Court. On the contrary, these are
                 somewhat confusing, intentionally or otherwise, making it impossible
                 clearly to discern the Parties’ positions in this respect and the continuity
                 of Belgium’s position in particular.

                 three approaches in parallel : negotiations — another precondition to the
                 seisin of the Court —, and there is no question that these have taken
                 place, with no prospect of success ; judicial co‑operation, as provided for
                 in Article 9 of the Convention against Torture, which is of a different
                 nature ; and the request for arbitration, which was not followed by any
                 additional details, such as an indication of the subject‑matter of the dis-
                 pute to be submitted to the arbitral tribunal, proposals relating to the
                 composition of that tribunal or the substantive rules to be examined. The
                 request for arbitration was, however, sometimes accompanied, often fol-
                 lowed, and as such obscured, by other approaches from Belgium concern-
                 ing the continuation of negotiations or proposals of judicial co‑operation,

                 to say, by another means of settling, or even preventing, the alleged dis-
                 pute. For its part, Senegal took note of the request for arbitration, but
                 this request was not followed by any concrete proposals from Belgium
                 regarding the practical details of its organization. The Convention, how-
                 ever, makes a clear distinction between these two stages.
                    16. Although, in fact, I subscribe to the Court’s finding that, since
                 arbitration could not be organized, this precondition of its jurisdiction
                 has been met, I am nevertheless disappointed that the Court did not take
                 this opportunity to clarify the condition in question. The Court could
                 have stated that, in order to avoid any confusion in the matter, a request
                 for arbitration should be put to the other party in an autonomous, dis-
                 tinct and separate way, with no other communication extraneous to the

                 tial organizational arrangements of the said arbitration. There would
                 therefore be no ambiguity about a refusal by the party approached or its
                 silence over a given period, or about the failure of negotiations concern-
                 ing the organization of the arbitration. In my view, this is not true of the
                 present proceedings, especially since the subjects of the dispute — extradi-
                 tion, delay in adopting the domestic measures to enable Senegal to exer-
                 cise its criminal jurisdiction, delay in referring the case to the competent

                 authorities for the institution of proceedings — remained undetermined
                 until the filing of the Application with the Court.

                                               Customary Rules
                    17. The Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on Bel-
                 gium’s allegations that Senegal had breached other rules of international
                 law, in particular a possible customary rule containing the obligation to
                 prosecute or extradite, which has given its title to the present Judgment.
                 It had jurisdiction on another basis : the convergent declarations of Bel-
                 gium and Senegal recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICJ. In my view, the
                 Court has completely failed to justify its refusal. It seems to me, therefore,

                 not been given to Belgium’s claim in this respect. Senegal also deserved
                 clarification on this point.
                    18. I am sorry to note that this declaration of lack of jurisdiction
                 appears to be the result of a twofold concern. On the one hand, to avoid
                 being drawn into a lengthy discussion which might delay the deliberation
                 in the case, and thus to simplify the dispute by confining it to the Conven-
                 tion against Torture ; on the other, to avoid having to find that the cus-
                 tomary rule invoked by Belgium did not exist, so as not to hinder its
                 possible subsequent establishment in customary law, and thus to main-
                 tain the uncertainty surrounding this point, pending further develop-
                 ments. Despite the Court’s silence — perhaps even on account of it — it

                 extradite, or even simply to prosecute, cannot be established in positive
                 law. It was necessary to determine that in order to respond to Belgium’s
                 claim. To my mind, the Court should have declared that it had jurisdic-
                 tion over this issue and considered it on the merits. In this respect, I
                 believe that it has failed fully to carry out its task of settling the dispute.
                 For that reason, I voted against this part of the operative clause.


                                II. Admissibility of Belgium’s Application

                    19. This, to my mind, is the central point of the case, and the aspect
                 of the Court’s decision with which I find it hardest to agree. Is Belgium
                 entitled to request that Senegal perform obligations which the former

                 assert ? Is it a State injured by a possible breach, meaning that it may seek
                 the finding of the alleged breach and reparation for it ? Belgium puts
                 ­forward two arguments to this effect. On the one hand, it argues that it
                  has passive criminal jurisdiction, since Belgian nationals have filed com-
                  plaints against Hissène Habré in Belgium, which justifies its extradition
                  request. This is in fact its principal argument. On the other hand, it con-
                  tends that its status as a party to the Convention is, in itself, grounds
                  for requesting as a non‑injured State that Senegal should initiate pro­


                          obligation to prosecute or extradite (diss. op. sur)             611

                 ceedings and, if it fails to do so, should extradite Mr. Habré to Belgium.
                 It was this second argument that was pushed to the fore during the pro-
                 ceedings before the Court and which, in the end, appeared to take prece-
                 dence over the first, thereby demonstrating that Belgium had been forced
                 to take account of the weakness of that first argument.
                    20. In the present Judgment, the Court decided not to examine Bel-
                 gium’s passive criminal jurisdiction, despite the fact that this served as the
                 basis of the latter’s conduct throughout the dispute, and was indeed a
                 fundamental argument in its Application. The Court resorts to an econ-
                 omy of means, regrettable in that it fails to address all of the Parties’
                 arguments, whether positive or negative. The Court also avoids noting
                 that this basis, i.e., the passive criminal jurisdiction of Belgium, cannot be

                 admissibility : the existence of an obligation erga omnes partes, which was
                 invoked only belatedly, whose foundation is doubtful to say the least and
                 which, in my view, the Court fails to justify in any way.

                           Irrelevance of Belgium’s Passive Criminal Jurisdiction
                    21. Belgium initially founded its extradition request, and its right to
                 request that the case be submitted to the competent authorities for the
                 purpose of prosecution in Senegal, on its passive criminal jurisdiction, on
                 account of the Belgian nationality of some of the alleged victims. How-
                 ever, the Belgian nationals in question had only acquired that nationality
                 several years after the facts, and thus relying on this naturalization

                 gium’s passive jurisdiction in respect of victims who possessed Belgian
                 nationality at the time of the facts. Under the Convention against Tor-
                 ture, the parties are not obliged to establish their passive criminal juris-
                 diction, meaning that the other parties are not obliged to recognize it, in
                 particular when their own criminal law makes no provision for it. Accord-
                 ingly, Belgium’s request for extradition became inadmissible, as did its
                 right to request that Senegal exercise its criminal jurisdiction, since it no
                 longer had a direct right to invoke as an injured State.

                     22. Belgium’s reliance on its passive criminal jurisdiction was not
                 s­imply theoretical. It can be seen in its unwavering conduct throughout
                  the case. Indeed, it was only after having registered and addressed in Bel-

                  those complaints, that Belgium transmitted an extradition request to Sen-
                  egal. That is when it considered that it had a direct right entitling it to
                  seek extradition or the institution of proceedings in Senegal. The basis for
                  that entitlement is the complaints filed in Belgium. This conduct alone
                  demonstrates that Belgium did not, therefore, envisage relying on any
                  basis other than this passive criminal jurisdiction. It was this which it
                  cited at the outset of the dispute and which was the basis of its initial
                  Application, even if it was not the reason behind its belated ratification of


                 the Convention against Torture. Naturalization, ratification, the filing of
                 complaints in Belgium : they all followed on from one another within the
                 space of a few months with propitious speed, indeed almost simultaneously.
                     23. Although Belgium founded the request it made in 2005 on a right
                 or special interest which it claimed to enjoy under the Convention by sole
                 virtue of its capacity as a State party, on the basis of an alleged obligation
                 erga omnes partes, it should have made that request as soon as it became
                 a party to the Convention, in 1999. It should have called at that time for
                 the opening of proceedings in Senegal, proceedings which would have
                 been owed to it irrespective of any complaints and simply in its capacity

                 considers that the alleged breach dates back to 2000, that is to say, to the
                 point when complaints against Hissène Habré failed in Senegal, it should
                 have raised the matter then. It would even have been justified in so doing,
                 I would reiterate, as soon as it became a party to the Convention, since
                 the presence of Hissène Habré in Senegalese territory was common
                 knowledge, as were the allegations against him.
                     24. Belgium’s lack of action at that stage demonstrates that it did not
                 hold this interpretation of the Convention at the time. If a complaint by
                 an individual which has not resulted in proceedings being brought is

                  Convention to be required, that amounts to “privatizing” an erga omnes
                  partes obligation which, if it exists, must be borne directly and exclusively
                  by the States parties. On the other hand, if the title invoked is passive
                  criminal jurisdiction, there is justification for complaints being a pre­
                  requisite for extradition requests. In other words, erga omnes partes juris­
                  diction takes effect immediately and is not dependent on individual
                  complaints, whereas a title of specific criminal jurisdiction invoked by one
                  party against another supposes that the exercise of such jurisdiction was
                  initiated by victims or their dependants and that the State having that
                  title claims it in respect of the State addressed. I shall return to this point,
                  overlooked by the Court, when examining whether or not there is an erga

                  case to the competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, failing
                  extradition.
                     25. Thus, Belgium’s entire conduct up to and including the oral pro-
                  ceedings was founded on its passive criminal jurisdiction. For example, it
                  is on this ground that it requested on several occasions, including quite
                  recently, the extradition of Hissène Habré, each time on the basis of com-
                  plaints of alleged victims. The Court, of course, is not bound by this rea-
                  soning. In determining and interpreting the rules that it applies, it may
                  invoke other elements and base its finding on its own considerations. It
                  was in response to a question put by one of the judges that Belgium
                  focused on its particular position as a non‑injured State, which is the

                  tion. The Court should explain and justify its position legally. In my view,
                  it merely asserts that there is an erga omnes partes obligation incumbent

                           obligation to prosecute or extradite (diss. op. sur)              613

                 lack, of legal bases in the Convention itself.


                     Non‑Existence of the Obligation Erga Omnes Partes Which Is Invoked
                       26. The obligation for the parties, as soon as the alleged perpetrator of
                    an offence as defined in the Convention is discovered in territory under
                    their jurisdiction, to submit the case to their competent authorities for the
                    purpose of prosecution is a procedural obligation, but not a substantive
                    one, since it may be that proceedings cannot take place, for reasons which

                    valid erga omnes partes, meaning that all parties may call for its perfor-
                  mance, regardless of whether they have a specific connection to the alleged
                  victims. To this end, it puts forward three general and undifferentiated
                  principles or presuppositions, none of which is truly demonstrated, and
                  which even appear to be contradicted by an examination of the Conven-
                  tion.
                       27. The three presuppositions in question are the following. First,
                  there are certain treaties establishing obligations erga omnes partes.
                  ­Second, the Convention against Torture is one of these, because it falls

                   overlooked by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codifying
                   customary law on the subject. Third, all of the obligations contained in
                   the Convention fall into this category, in particular the obligation to sub-
                   mit the case to the competent authorities for the institution of criminal
                   proceedings. I shall refer briefly to the first assertion because, supposing
                   it to be true in positive law, it would in no way imply that the Conven­
                   tion against Torture, particularly the Convention in its entirety, meets
                   the conditions that are laid down.
                       28. (a) On this first point, the Court invokes the dictum of the Bar­
                 celona Traction case (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company,
                 ­Limited (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970)
