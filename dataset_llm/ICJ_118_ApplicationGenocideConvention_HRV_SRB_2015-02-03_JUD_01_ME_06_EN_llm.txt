                        1. Much to my regret, I have voted against the operative paragraph 1
                     of the Judgment regarding the Court’s jurisdiction to entertain Croatia’s
                     claim in so far as it concerns acts prior to 27 April 1992. For the reasons
                     explained below, I reserve my position with regard to the Court’s finding
                     that in the context of the present case it could found its jurisdiction on the
                     basis of State succession to responsibility under Article IX of the Geno-
                     cide Convention. I maintain the view that Serbia’s second objection to
                     jurisdiction ratione temporis and admissibility should be upheld.

                        2. When the Court in the 18 November 2008 Judgment on Preliminary
                     Objections (Application of the Convention on the Prevention And Punish‑
                     ment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Preliminary Objec‑
                     tions, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 412 (“the 2008 Judgment”)) drew
                     the conclusion that Serbia’s second jurisdictional objection did not pos-
                     sess an exclusively preliminary character, it primarily addressed Croatia’s
                     argument that Serbia as a State in statu nascendi was responsible for acts
                     carried out by its officials and organs or otherwise under its direction and
                     control before 27 April 1992. In that connection, the Court highlighted
                     “two inseparable issues” for it to determine at the merits stage : the appli-
                     cability of the obligations under the Genocide Convention to acts that
                     occurred before the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the FRY”) came
                     into existence as a separate State, and the question of attribution of such
                     acts to the FRY for invoking its international responsibility under gen-
                     eral international law (ibid., p. 460, para. 129). In identifying these “two
                     inseparable issues”, the Court apparently had in mind the rules as stated
                     in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility
                     (Annex to General Assembly resolution 56/83, 12 December 2001, “the
                     ILC Articles”).

                         4. In the present proceedings, with regard to Croatia’s claim that the
                      FRY was a State in statu nascendi at the time when the alleged genocidal
                      acts took place, the Court first set out to determine at which point of time
                      the FRY became bound by the Convention, and whether the obligations
                      to prevent and punish genocide under the Convention can be applied
                     ­retroactively to the FRY before it became a party to the Convention.

                        5. Having examined the travaux préparatoires and the text of the
                     ­ onvention, the Court comes to the conclusion that, as is stated in the
                     2008 Judgment, Serbia was bound by the Convention with effect only
                     from 27 April 1992. Even in respect of State responsibility, “the Conven-
                     tion is not retroactive”. It underlines that “[t]o hold otherwise would be
                     to disregard the rule expressed in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on
                     the Law of Treaties. There is no basis for doing so in the text of the Con-
                     vention or in its negotiating history.” (Judgment, para. 99.) With that
                     conclusion, the issue of attribution becomes moot. The Court therefore
                     does not see any need to further examine whether the FRY was or was
                     not a State in statu nascendi at the time of the occurrence of the alleged
                     acts, hence no question about the applicability of Article 10, paragraph 2,
                     of the ILC Articles to the present case.

                        7. The Court’s treatment of State succession to responsibility as a sep-
                     arate heading for the consideration of jurisdiction ratione temporis, in my
                     opinion, is a questionable departure from the 2008 Judgment. Procedur-
                     ally Croatia’s alternative argument about the FRY’s succession to the
                     responsibility of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the
                     SFRY”) does raise a new claim for jurisdiction, a claim that is based on
                     treaty obligations undertaken by a third party. When the Court has
                     already concluded in the Judgment that even in respect of State responsi-
                     bility the Convention is not retroactive, that claim is apparently related to
                     the question of succession rather than responsibility.

                        9. The question of succession in the present case is a complicated issue.
                     From 1992 to 2000, the FRY remained in a sui generis status, which gave
                     rise to a series of legal questions regarding its standing, locus standi,
                     before the Court. The political premise of Serbia’s succession was much
                     dictated, in my view, by the fact that its 1992 declaration and Note simul-
                     taneously sent to the Secretary‑General of the United Nations were more
                     often treated with political expediency than given consistent legal inter-
                     pretation under international law in the light of the factual situation.
                     Croatia’s alternative argument in the present case once again brings the
                     issue to the fore.

                        11. In the 2008 Judgment, the Court states that “[i]n the particular
                     context of the case, the Court is of the view that the 1992 declaration
                     must be considered as having had the effects of a notification of succes-
                     sion to treaties, notwithstanding that its political premise was different”
                     (2008 Judgment, p. 451, para. 111), and
                           “from that date onwards the FRY would be bound by the obligations
                           of a party in respect of all the multilateral conventions to which the
                           SFRY had been a party at the time of its dissolution, subject of course
                           to any reservations lawfully made by the SFRY limiting its obliga-
                           tions” (ibid., pp. 454‑455, para. 117 ; emphasis added).

                     While upholding the validity of the FRY’s commitments to international
                     obligations, the Court, however, does not indicate the legal consequences
                     that are necessarily derived from the change of that political premise.

                        12. Under international law, the implication of the new political prem-
                     ise is arguably three‑fold for the FRY. First of all, the FRY, being one of
                     the successor States rather than the sole continuator of the SFRY, does
                     not enjoy all the rights of its predecessor, nor does it continue to assume

                       16. In the Judgment the Court concludes that “[i]n the present case,
                     any jurisdiction which the Court possesses is derived from Article IX of
                     the Genocide Convention and is therefore confined to obligations arising
                     under the Convention itself”. In that regard, the meaning of the term
                     “including those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide” in
                     Article IX is apparently decisive for the Court to determine whether or
                     not, on Croatia’s alternative argument, it has jurisdiction over the alleged
                     acts in question.
                       17. The Court first rejects Serbia’s contention that Croatia’s claim for
                     State succession is a new claim. It decides that since the essential subject‑­





7 CIJ1077.indb 768                                                                                    18/04/16 08:54

                     386 	      application of genocide convention (decl. xue)

                     matter of the dispute concerns Serbia’s responsibility and Croatia’s stand-
                     ing to invoke that responsibility, the dispute between the Parties in the
                     present case falls squarely within the terms of Article IX (Judgment,
                     para. 90). In the reasoning, it emphasizes that “[t]he question whether
                     Serbia is responsible for such alleged violations must be distinguished
                     from the manner in which that responsibility is said to be established”. In
                     its view, to invoke responsibility by direct attribution or to invoke respon-
                     sibility on the basis of succession is just a difference in “manner”. What
                     the Court, however, fails to mention is that each of such “manners” con-
                     cerns a matter of law that has to be initially decided by the Court for
                     founding its jurisdiction. That is to say, the Court has to first determine
                     whether State succession to responsibility falls within the terms of Arti-
                     cle IX and, if so, in the context of the present case, whether or not Serbia
                     should succeed to the responsibility of the SFRY. Only when these issues
                     are settled, does the Court have the jurisdiction to address the merits of
                     the case, but not the other way round.

                        20. Under Article IX of the Convention, the Court is not called to
                     settle any dispute that concerns interpretation, application and fulfilment
                     of the Convention, but a dispute that should directly relate to the rights
                     and obligations of the parties. It always has to first ascertain whose obli-
                     gations are allegedly breached and who has the right to invoke interna-
                     tional responsibility for that breach. In the judicial settlement process
                     that is the condition of locus standi, regardless of the nature of the obliga-
                     tions, synallagmatic or erga omnes. Likewise, the Court is not called to
                     settle any dispute that concerns State responsibility, but a dispute that
                     may engage the responsibility of the parties to the dispute. The conditions
                     for entailing State responsibility are governed by general international
                     law. Unless and until such conditions are satisfied, no State responsibility
                     can be invoked.

                        27. Before I close my remarks on the question of jurisdiction, I wish to
                     add one word on Croatia’s argument about the “time gap” in the protec-
                     tion. Croatia claims that a decision to limit jurisdiction to events after
                     27 April 1992 would create a “time gap” in the protection afforded by the
                     Convention. From the viewpoint of human rights protection, that argu-
                     ment is obviously very strong and appealing. However, when Croatia
                     seeks legal protection from the Court on the basis of Article IX of the
                     Convention and invokes Serbia’s responsibility under the Convention,
                     the jurisdiction of the Court has to be “confined to obligations arising
                     under the Convention itself”, and has to be confined to those that are
                     undertaken by Serbia. This kind of “time gap”, if any, could occur not
                     only in the event of State succession, but also with any State before it
                     becomes a party to the Convention. That is the limit of treaty régime.

                        29. At the international level, in the situation related to the present
                     case, an ad hoc criminal tribunal, i.e., the International Criminal Tribunal
                     for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established to bring to justice
                     those responsible for crimes committed during the course of the SFRY’s
                     dissolution process, despite the fact that the SFRY had ceased to exist.
                     Although individual criminal responsibility and State responsibility are
                     distinct, protection and justice thus accorded are equally important.
                     Whether Serbia should be held responsible for the SFRY’s alleged breach
                     of its international obligations under the Convention can only be adjudged
                     in accordance with international law.
