   No implied obligation in Genocide Convention for States not to commit geno-
cide — Such unstated obligation unnecessary to engage State responsibility for
genocide — State responsibility engaged when an individual, whose acts are
attributable to the State, commits crime of genocide — Court lacks criminal
jurisdiction necessary to establish whether individuals have committed geno-
cide — Determination by courts and tribunals with such criminal jurisdiction
may provide basis for State responsibility for genocide if they are consistent
with requirements of Genocide Convention — Judgments of ICTY in Krstić and
Blagojević not consistent as based on crime of “aiding and abetting” and involve
findings relating to state of mind of persons not before ICTY — Commission of
genocide at Srebrenica not sufficiently established.

  In the 2004 Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court has acknowl-
edged a certain legal reality, which exists independently from the wishes
of the Court or the Parties and which cannot be any different in this case :
Serbia and Montenegro had not been a Member of the United Nations,
and consequently, was not a party to the Statute of the Court, before it
was admitted on 1 November 2000 to the United Nations as a new Mem-
ber under Article 4 of the United Nations Charter (see, for example,
Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, pp. 314-315, para. 91).
On that basis, the Court has concluded that Serbia and Montenegro did
not have access to the Court at the time of institution of proceedings and
for that reason, the Court decided that it had no jurisdiction to entertain
these cases (ibid., pp. 327-328, paras. 127 and 129).
  However, what the Court’s reasoning in the present case means is that,
by application of the principle of res judicata in incidental proceedings,
the Court can create parallel realities : namely, in this case, unlike in the




Legality of Use of Force cases, the existence of access to the Court by the
Respondent by virtue of its finding on jurisdiction in the 1996 Judgment
on Preliminary Objections (Application of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 595).

  The notion that the issue of access by the Respondent to the Court
under Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute must be considered as
having been dealt with in the 1996 Judgment, although it undoubtedly
was not, is a further blow to the reality which, according to the Judg-
ment, may be altered as “a matter of logical construction” if the integrity
of the principle of res judicata so requires :
      “the legal complications of the position of the Respondent in rela-
      tion to the United Nations were not specifically mentioned in the
      1996 Judgment. The Court stated . . . that ‘Yugoslavia was bound by
      the provisions of the [Genocide] Convention on the date of the filing
      of the Application in the present case’ (Application of the Conven-
      tion on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
      (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
      ment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 610, para. 17), and found that ‘on
      the basis of Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and
      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, it has jurisdiction to adjudi-
      cate upon the dispute’ (ibid., p. 623, para. 47 (2) (a)). Since . . . the
      question of a State’s capacity to be a party to proceedings is a matter
      which precedes that of jurisdiction ratione materiae, and one which
      the Court must, if necessary, raise ex officio, . . . this finding must as
      a matter of construction be understood, by necessary implication, to
      mean that the Court at that time perceived the Respondent as being
      in a position to participate in cases before the Court. On that basis,
      it proceeded to make a finding on jurisdiction which would have the
      force of res judicata. The Court does not need, for the purpose of the
      present proceedings, to go behind that finding and consider on what
      basis the Court was able to satisfy itself on the point. Whether the
      Parties classify the matter as one of ‘access to the Court’ or of ‘juris-
      diction ratione personae’, the fact remains that the Court could not
      have proceeded to determine the merits unless the Respondent had
      had the capacity under the Statute to be a party to proceedings
      before the Court.” (Judgment, para. 132.)

  It should also be noted that the part of the 1996 Judgment dealing with
jurisdiction ratione personae concerned only the question of whether the
Applicant and the Respondent were parties to the Genocide Convention,
and the assumption of that Judgment was that the Convention satisfies
the requirement of Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute, and thus rep-
resents an independent and sufficient basis for the Respondent’s access to
the Court. This was in line with a provisional view which the Court had
taken in the 1993 Order indicating provisional measures :

      “proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
      which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
      is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
      down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
      tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
      Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,
      I.C.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 19).
   That is why the Court did not address the uncertain and contradictory

  The idea that the parallel reality, created by the Court, is as solid as the
one existing independently from it, is expressed in the Judgment in no
ambiguous terms :
         “However fundamental the question of the capacity of States to
      be parties in cases before the Court may be, it remains a question to
      be determined by the Court, in accordance with Article 36, para-
      graph 6, of the Statute, and once a finding in favour of jurisdiction
      has been pronounced with the force of res judicata, it is not open to
      question or re-examination, except by way of revision under Arti-
      cle 61 of the Statute. There is thus, as a matter of law, no possibility
      that the Court might render ‘its final decision with respect to a party
      over which it cannot exercise its judicial function’, because the ques-
      tion whether a State is or is not a party subject to the jurisdiction of
      the Court is one which is reserved for the sole and authoritative deci-
      sion of the Court.” (Judgment, para. 138.)

  The Court’s line of argument is based on the notion of a general find-
ing on jurisdiction reached in incidental proceedings being absolute and
exhaustive in nature (it goes without saying that the Court’s decisions on
specific preliminary objections have the full authority of res judicata).

   For the reasons stated above, I could not support the conclusion of the
Court as contained in paragraph 1 of the operative clause of the Judg-
ment.


                                   MERITS

   Under Article IX of the Genocide Convention the Court is to settle
disputes between the Contracting Parties, “including those [disputes]
relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or for any of the
other acts enumerated in Article III”. The underlying logic of the Judg-
ment is that no State can be held responsible for genocide or any of the

the actual terms of the Convention” (ibid.). Then, according to the logic
of the Judgment, this obligation must be implied in Article I : “the obliga-
tion to prevent genocide necessarily implies the prohibition of the com-
mission of genocide” (ibid.). The Judgment also concludes that the obli-
gation of States to not commit genocide themselves is applicable to the
other acts enumerated in Article III (Judgment, para. 167).

   First, the very idea of an unstated obligation is objectionable in
general.
   Second, the “unstated obligation” in question does not fit into the
Convention. The Convention, in its substantive part, deals with the
criminal culpability of individuals. The Judgment addresses this fact and
attempts to reconcile it with the idea of a State’s obligation to not
commit the very criminal acts it undertakes to prevent and punish. This




attempt, however, is not persuasive. Nor could it be, since it is simply not
what the Convention actually says.

   The Court, while concluding that “the Contracting Parties to the Con-
vention are bound not to commit genocide” makes a clarification that the
Parties are under the obligation not to do so “through the actions of their
organs or persons or groups whose acts are attributable to them” (Judg-
ment, para. 167).
   The Court states that “if an organ of the State, or a person or group
whose acts are legally attributable to the State, commits any of the acts
proscribed by Article III of the Convention, the international responsi-
bility of that State is incurred” (Judgment, para. 179). This is absolutely
true. A State’s responsibility is engaged when a crime of genocide is com-
mitted by an individual whose acts are legally attributable to it. No
“unstated obligation” for States not to themselves commit genocide is
needed for this responsibility to be incurred through attribution.

   The Court asserts that :
         “Any other interpretation could entail that there would be no
      legal recourse available under the Convention in some readily con-




      ceivable circumstances : genocide has allegedly been committed
      within a State by its leaders but they have not been brought to trial
      because, for instance, they are still very much in control of the pow-
      ers of the State including the police, prosecution services and the
      courts and there is no international penal tribunal able to exercise
      jurisdiction over the alleged crimes ; or the responsible State may
      have acknowledged the breach.” (Judgment, para. 182.)

   Having stated that it “must itself make its own determination of the
facts which are relevant to the law which the Applicant claims the
Respondent has breached”, the Court acknowledges that “[m]any of the
allegations before the Court have already been the subject of the
processes and decisions of the ICTY” (Judgment, para. 212) and con-
cludes that :




      “it should in principle accept as highly persuasive relevant findings
      of fact made by the Tribunal at trial, unless of course they have been
      upset on appeal. For the same reasons, any evaluation by the Tri-
      bunal based on the facts as so found for instance about the existence
      of the required intent, is also entitled to due weight.” (Judgment,
      para. 223.)

  The Court concluded that acts of genocide were committed by “mem-
bers of the VRS [Army of the Republika Srpska] in and around Sre-
brenica from about 13 July 1995” (Judgment, para. 297). In reaching this
conclusion the Court relied on the findings of the ICTY in the Krstić and
Blagojević cases (Krstić, IT-98-33-A, Judgment of Appeals Chamber,
19 April 2004 (hereafter “Krstić”) and Blagojević and Jokić, IT-02-60-T,
Judgment of Trial Chamber I, 17 January 2005 (hereafter “Blagojević”)).

   These two individuals (only Krstić’s conviction is final) were convicted
of a crime established by the Tribunal’s Statute (Art. 7, para. 1), but not
recognized by the Genocide Convention, namely aiding and abetting
genocide. As found by the ICTY, neither Krstić nor Blagojević had geno-
cidal intent. (“There was a demonstrable failure by the Trial Chamber to
supply adequate proof that Radislav Krstić possessed the genocidal
intent” (Krstić, para. 134).) The Tribunal, basing itself on its Statute, has

up with an initiative on the subject stating that “the duty to prevent
places States under positive obligations, to do their best to ensure that
such acts do not occur” (Judgment, para. 432) and adding that,
      “a State may be found to have violated its obligation to prevent even
      though it had no certainty, at the time when it should have acted,
      but failed to do so, that genocide was about to be committed or was
      under way ; . . . it is enough that the State was aware, or should
      normally have been aware, of the serious danger that acts of geno-
      cide would be committed” (Judgment, para. 432).

   Consequently, I could not support the conclusion of the Court as con-
tained in paragraph 5 of the operative clause. In addition, my negative
vote on this paragraph also reflects my position, as outlined above, that it
has not been sufficiently established that the massacre in Srebrenica can
be qualified as genocide.
   For the latter reason, I could not support the finding of the Court con-
tained in paragraph 7 of the operative clause as to the Respondent’s non-
compliance with the provisional measures ordered by the Court on
8 April and 13 September 1993. However, I hold the view that the
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not act on these
Orders as they should have. Should they have done so, this could have
had an effect of averting many of the atrocities other than genocide. The
fact that these atrocities occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the
relevant period has not been denied by the Respondent.
   I supported the finding contained in paragraph 6 since the Respondent
