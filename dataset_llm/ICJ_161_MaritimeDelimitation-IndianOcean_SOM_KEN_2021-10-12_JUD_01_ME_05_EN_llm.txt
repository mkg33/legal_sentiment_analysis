                        1. In this opinion, I explain the reasons for my disagreement with
                      paragraph 214 (5) of the Judgment and make observations on other
                      parts.
                        2. Paragraph 214 (5) of the Judgment reads as follows :
                               “[The Court] . . . [d]ecides that from Point B, the maritime bound-
                            ary delimiting the continental shelf continues along the same geodetic
                            line until it reaches the outer limits of the continental shelf or the area
                            where the rights of third States may be affected[.]”

                        3. Since Point B is the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone and
                      continental shelf within 200 nautical miles, the formulation of this para-
                      graph makes clear that the Court has delimited the continental shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles. However, for the following reasons, the Court
                      was not in a position to carry out such a delimitation.

                        4. First, the régime for a coastal State’s entitlement to a continental
                      shelf within 200 nautical miles is different from the régime for its entitle-
                      ment to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, and it is this differ-
                      ence that makes the Court’s finding in paragraph 214 (5) questionable.
                      Article 76 (1) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
                      (hereinafter “UNCLOS” or the “Convention”) provides as follows :

                               “The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and
                            subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea
                            throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer
                            edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles
                            from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
                            measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not
                            extend up to that distance.”
                        5. Although the Convention defines the continental shelf in geological
                      and geomorphological terms as the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine
                      areas throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the
                      outer edge of the continental margin, it also provides that, in cases where
                      the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend to 200 nautical
                      miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
                      measured, the continental shelf will extend to that distance. In effect,
                      therefore, the distance criterion supersedes the geological and geomor-

                         6. In order to determine a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles there must be in existence a continental margin
                      that extends beyond 200 nautical miles because, by virtue of Article 76 (1)
                      of the Convention, the continental shelf extends to the outer edge of the
                      continental margin. Paragraph 3 of Article 76 of the Convention defines
                      the margin as “compris[ing] the submerged prolongation of the land mass
                      of the coastal State, and consist[ing] of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf,
                      the slope and the rise”. Therefore, in order to delimit, the Court must
                      have before it reliable evidence that there is in existence, in the area
                      beyond 200 nautical miles, a “submerged prolongation of the land mass
                      of the coastal State”. According to paragraph 6 of Article 76 of the Con-
                      vention, the outer limit of the continental shelf “shall not exceed 350 nau-
                      tical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea
                      is measured”.
                         7. Thus, in relation to the delimitation of the continental shelf beyond
                      200 nautical miles, geological and geomorphological criteria supersede
                      the distance criterion, because there can be no entitlement to a continen-
                      tal shelf in the area beyond 200 nautical miles and up to a distance of
                      350 nautical miles, unless there is certainty that there is in existence a
                      continental margin in that area. Since under the Convention a coastal
                      State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles is
                      determined by geological and geomorphological factors, the Court must
                      ensure that those factors exist before delimiting the continental shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles.
                         8. The distinction between delineation of the outer limit of the conti-
                      nental shelf by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
                      (hereinafter the “CLCS” or “Commission”) and maritime delimitation by
                      the Court is clear. It is equally clear that recommendations by the CLCS
                      on the outer limit of the continental shelf do not constitute a necessary
                      precondition for maritime delimitation by the Court. But in order to
                      carry out such a delimitation, the Court must have reliable evidence con-
                      firming the existence of a continental shelf in the area beyond 200 nauti-
                      cal miles.
                         9. The Judgment reflects an awareness of the requirement that the
                      Court must have at hand reliable information confirming the existence of
                      a continental margin in the area beyond 200 nautical miles if it is to be in
                      a position to carry out a delimitation in that area. However, as will be
                      seen, the Court ignores this requirement.
                         10. After citing Article 76 (4) of the Convention, the Judgment con-
                      cludes that
                            “[t]he entitlement of a State to the continental shelf beyond 200 nau-
                            tical miles thus depends on geological and geomorphological criteria.

                      328 	            maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                            An essential step in any delimitation is to determine whether there are
                            entitlements, and whether they overlap.” (Judgment, para. 193.)

                      The Court noted that the Tribunal in Bangladesh/Myanmar was only able
                      to carry out delimitation of the shelf beyond 200 nautical miles because of
                      what the Tribunal described as the “unique situation in the Bay of the
                      Bengal”, a feature which the Judgment states explicitly “is not the same
                      as [present case]”. The Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for
                      the Law of the Sea (“ITLOS”) in Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire held that it “can
                      delimit the continental shelf beyond 200 [nautical miles] only if such a
                      continental shelf exists” 1, and that it had the benefit of the Commission’s
                      affirmative recommendations in relation to Ghana ; it also observed that
                      the “geological situation [of Côte d’Ivoire was] identical to that of
                      Ghana” 2. The Special Chamber emphasized that there is “no doubt that
                      a continental shelf beyond 200 [nautical miles] exists in respect of the two
                      Parties” 3. The need for a court or tribunal to be certain about the exis-
                      tence of a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles if it is to carry out
                      a delimitation in that area was also emphasized by the Tribunal in Ban‑
                      gladesh/Myanmar. The Tribunal stated that it would have been hesitant
                      to proceed to delimit the area beyond 200 nautical miles if there was

                         11. As if to contradict the cautionary note it had sounded in relation
                      to any reliance on the decisions in Bangladesh/Myanmar and Ghana/
                      Côte d’Ivoire, the Court in paragraph 194 rather unexpectedly announced
                      its decision to delimit the continental shelf boundaries up to the outer
                      limit of the continental shelf.
                         12. It is ironical that, having taken the pains to isolate and identify the
                      critically relevant information that ITLOS and its Special Chamber had
                      in the Bangladesh/Myanmar and Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire cases, the Court
                      proceeded to delimit the Parties’ continental shelf in the area beyond
                      200 nautical miles without any convincing evidence as to the existence of
                      a shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. This contrasts with the decision of the
                      Court in Nicaragua v. Colombia not to delimit the continental shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles, because Nicaragua relied on information it
                      had submitted to the CLCS that did not substantiate its claim to a conti-
                      nental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles 5.

                         13. The Judgment is bereft of even a scintilla of reliable evidence that
                      the geological and geomorphological criteria, which the Judgment itself
                      refers to in paragraph 193 as being essential in the determination of State
                      entitlements, have been met.
                         14. The Court comes closest to identifying evidence of the existence of
                      a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles when it noted “that in their
                      submissions to the Commission both Somalia and Kenya claim on the
                      basis of scientific evidence a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles
                      and that their claims overlap” (paragraph 194 of the Judgment). How-
                      ever, this observation does not provide a sufficient basis for the delimita-
                      tion because nowhere in the Judgment is there any reference to the content
                      of this scientific evidence and, more importantly, nowhere in the Judg-
                      ment is there any analysis of that content to show that the Court is satis-
                      fied that the necessary geological and geomorphological criteria have
                      been met for the existence of a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
                      miles. It must be made clear that in this case the Court was not asked to
                      examine any scientific data that would establish the existence of a conti-
                      nental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. It is, of course, perfectly proper to
                      refer to the Parties’ submissions to the Commission. However, if it relies
                      on these submissions, the Court must explain why it finds them persua-
                      sive. Such an explanation is the more necessary where, as in this case, the
                      Commission has not yet made any recommendations on the submissions
                      of the Parties. Thus, it appears that the principal factors that explain the
                      Court’s decision to delimit the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles
                      are the criterion of the 350-nautical-mile distance as the outer limit of the
                      continental shelf and the volition of the Parties to have the Court effect a
                      delimitation. But, in delimiting the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
                      miles, geological and geomorphological factors supersede distance as the
                      criteria for determining a State’s entitlement to that shelf, thereby render-
                      ing less consequential the request of the Parties to have the Court effect a
                      delimitation in that area.


                        15. The lack of any evidence of geological and geomorphological data
                      to substantiate the existence of a continental shelf, and thus, of the entitle­
                      ment of the Parties to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles,
                      undermines the validity of the finding in paragraph 214 (5), which is the
                      principal conclusion of the Court in the part of its Judgment devoted to
                      the delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. None-
                      theless, the present opinion will comment on other aspects of the Judg-
                      ment relating to this finding.
                        16. Second, in the delimitation of the continental shelf in the area
                      beyond 200 nautical miles the Court has overvalued the volition of the
                      Parties and the fact that “neither Party questions the existence of the
                      other Party’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles
                      or the extent of that claim” (paragraph 194 of the Judgment). In the
                      delimitation of the continental shelf up to 200 nautical miles, it is





8 Ord_1229.indb 250                                                                                     5/12/22 08:27

                      330 	           maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                      a­ ppropriate for the Court to act entirely on requests of the Parties for it
                       to carry out such a delimitation, because in that area the distance crite-
                       rion of 200 nautical miles prevails. However, where, as here, the Court is
                      delimiting the continental shelf in the area beyond 200 nautical miles, the
                       requests of the Parties, and the congruence of their views as to their
                       respective entitlement to a shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and the extent
                       of that entitlement, do not constitute a sufficient basis for delimitation in
                       that area. By effecting a delimitation of a party’s continental shelf beyond
                       200 nautical miles without any reliable evidence of the existence of a shelf
                       in that area, the Court has effectively eliminated the important difference
                       drawn by the Convention between a coastal State’s entitlement to a shelf
                       within and beyond 200 nautical miles. In the result, by delimiting on the
                       presumption that the Parties are entitled to a shelf of up to 350 nautical
                       miles, the Court has replaced the geological and geomorphological crite-
                       ria required by the Convention for such an entitlement with a simple dis-
                       tance criterion of a maximum of 350 nautical miles. There is nothing in
                      the Judgment that comes close to the categoric findings in the Bangladesh/
                       Myanmar and Bangladesh v. India cases as to the existence of a continen-
                       tal shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.

                         17. Third, the Court has carried out a delimitation of the continental
                      shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in an environment riddled with uncertainty.
                      Although the use of a directional arrow, such as the one contained in
                      sketch-map No. 13 (p. 279), is not uncommon in delimitation of the conti-
                      nental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, there must be some doubt as to
                      whether this approach provides the level of certainty that one would expect
                      in an exercise as consequential as the delimitation of a boundary between
                      two States, which will have sovereign rights in the area attributed to them.
                         18. This uncertainty is even more evident in paragraph 197 of the
                      Judgment, which reads:
                               “Depending on the extent of Kenya’s entitlement to a continental
                            shelf beyond 200 nautical miles as it may be established in the future
                            on the basis of the Commission’s recommendation, the delimitation
                            line might give rise to an area of limited size located beyond 200 nau-
                            tical miles from the coast of Kenya and within 200 nautical miles from
                            the coast of Somalia, but on the Kenyan side of the delimitation line
                            (‘grey area’).” (Emphasis mine.)
                      This reasoning is a conjecture built on a surmise founded on a hypothe-
                      sis — scarcely a basis for the construction of a legal régime. Regrettably,
                      the grey area that it identifies is not of “limited size”, but in the circum-
                      stances of this case, may be seen as applying to the entire area beyond
                      200 nautical miles. It is noted, however, that the Court decided not to
                      address the question of the legal régime that would be applicable to this
                      grey area.

                      331 	            maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                         19. Notwithstanding that delineation of the outer limits of the conti-
                      nental shelf is carried out by coastal States on the basis of the recommen-
                      dations of the CLCS, and not by the Court, there must be a concern that
                      delimitation and delineation exercises may impact adversely on the area,
                      defined in Article 1 (1) of the Convention as “the seabed and ocean floor
                      and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”. The area
                      therefore begins where national jurisdiction ends. Article 136 provides
                      that “[t]he Area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind”;
                      Article 140 (1) provides that “activities in the Area” are to be carried out
                      “for the benefit of mankind as a whole . . . and taking into particular
                      consideration the interests and needs of developing States”. During the
                      UNCLOS negotiations, generally, developing countries attached the
                      greatest importance to the establishment of a meaningful régime for the
                      area in the expectation that its exploration and exploitation would con-
                      tribute to their growth and development in the interest of the common
                      heritage of mankind.

                      for the area were expressed by the Arbitral Tribunal in the France-­Canada
                      Maritime Delimitation case (Saint Pierre and Miquelon), in which France
                      had requested delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
                      miles. The Commission stated:
                               “Any decision by this Court recognizing or rejecting any rights of
                            the Parties over the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles,
                            would constitute a pronouncement involving a delimitation, not
                            ‘between the Parties’ but between each one of them and the interna-
                            tional community, represented by organs entrusted with the adminis-
                            tration and protection of the international sea-bed Area (the sea-bed
                            beyond national jurisdiction) that has been declared to be the com-
                            mon heritage of mankind.” 6
                      While this Award, made not very long after the adoption of the Conven-
                      tion, may be seen as going too far, its underlying concern should not be
                      disregarded: where it is appropriate, the interests of the international
                      community in exploring and exploiting the area is a factor that must be

                      cal miles. Moreover, in the Bangladesh/Myanmar case the Tribunal
                      expressly considered the possible impact of the delimitation of the shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles on the interests of the international community
                      in the area, and determined in the following finding that those interests
                      were not affected:

                              “In addition, as far as the Area is concerned, the Tribunal wishes
                            to observe that, as is evident from the Parties’ submissions to the

                      332 	           maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                            Commission, the continental shelf beyond 200 nm that is the subject
                            of delimitation in the present case is situated far from the Area.
                            Accordingly, the Tribunal, by drawing a line of delimitation, will not
                            prejudice the rights of the international community.” 7
                      A fair inference from this finding is that the Tribunal would not have car-
                      ried out the delimitation requested or, at any rate, would have given serious
                      thought to declining that delimitation, had it found that this delimitation
                      was to be carried out in an area that was near to the area in which the
                      international community has an interest. It would seem that, in the instant
                      case, a statement similar to that of the Tribunal in Bangladesh/Myanmar
                      could not be made by the Court, because the continental shelf that is the
                      subject of delimitation could possibly extend to the area. N  ­ onetheless the

                         21. Fourth, Article 83 (1) of the Convention requires that the delimita-
                      tion of the continental shelf be effected by agreement on the basis of inter-
                      national law in order to achieve an equitable solution. In the delimitation
                      of the continental shelf within 200 nautical miles, the Court quite prop-
                      erly spent much time considering whether its three-stage methodology
                      produced an equitable solution. On the other hand, in the delimitation of
                      the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, the Judgment is silent on
                      the question whether the methodology the Court has used produces an
                      equitable solution. This is a significant omission in the Judgment and it
                      raises serious questions as to whether the delimitation carried out has
                      been effected in accordance with the Convention.

                         22. The best statement of the law on the relationship between a rele-
                      vant circumstance, a concavity, the median line and a cut‑off effect is the
                      finding of the ITLOS in Bangladesh/Myanmar that
                            “concavity per se is not necessarily a relevant circumstance. However,
                            when an equidistance line drawn between two States produces a cut-
                            off effect on the maritime entitlement of one of those States, as a result
                            of the concavity of the coast, then an adjustment of that line may be
                            necessary in order to reach an equitable result.” 8
                        23. The question is whether the cut-off effect produced by the equidis-
                      tance line must result from a geographical feature that meets the mini-
                      mum requirements for a concavity or whether it can result from any

                      geographical feature, such as a mere curvature or an indentation, even if
                      that feature does not meet the minimum requirements for a concavity.
                      Case law is generally unhelpful in identifying the minimum features for a

                      requires its adjustment in order to achieve an equitable solution. The
                      comments that one finds on this question are of a general nature ; for
                      example, in Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire, the Special Chamber found “that the
                      coast of Côte d’Ivoire is concave, although such concavity is not as pro-
                      nounced as in, for example, the case of the Bay of Bengal” 9.
                         24. In the 1969 North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the Court found
                      that the German coast was “markedly concave” 10. It is not for nothing
                      that in considering the German concavity, the Court referred to another
                      coastline, that of Bangladesh, that was also markedly concave. Indeed, in
                      Bangladesh/Myanmar, ITLOS held that the Bangladesh coast was “mani-
                      festly concave” and that, consequently, the equidistance line produced a
                      cut‑off effect warranting the adjustment of that line. One may also con-
                      sider the Court’s decision in Costa Rica v. Nicaragua. However, that
                      decision is not apposite because the Court did not examine in detail
                      ­
                      whether a concavity existed, but simply confined itself to the conclusion
                      that the existence of a concavity did not produce a cut‑off effect warrant-
                      ing an adjustment of the equidistance line. This is to be contrasted
                      with the instant case in which the majority has found not only that there
                      is a concavity, but that “[w]hen the mainland coasts of Somalia,
                      Kenya and Tanzania are observed together, as a whole, the coastline
                      is undoubtedly concave” and that, consequently, the equidistance line
                      produces a cut‑off effect that warrants some adjustment of that line. In
                      Cameroon v. Nigeria, the Court found that there was no concavity in the
                      sectors of the coastline relevant to the present delimitation 11. In Guinea/
                      Guinea-­Bissau, the Tribunal found that the coastline of Guinea‑Bissau,
                      Guinea and Sierra Leone, when considered together, was generally con-
                      cave 12.

                         25. In accordance with the Court’s jurisprudence therefore, an adjust-
                      ment of the equidistance line is only required when it produces a cut‑off
                      effect as a result of a coastal feature that is obviously concave or, to use
                      the language of the Court in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases,
                      “markedly concave” or that of the Tribunal in Bangladesh/Myanmar,
                      “manifestly concave”. That the Court did not have in mind a cut‑off
                      effect resulting from a slight curvature or an indentation in a coast is clear

                      334 	           maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                      from its finding in Libya/Malta 16 years later, that an equidistance line
                      “may yield a disproportionate result where a coast is . . . markedly con-
                      cave or convex” 13. Here the Court was restating its finding in the

                      yield disproportionate results when a coastal feature has a concavity or
                      convexity that would have the effect of pulling the line inwards or out-
                      wards. What is significant is that the Court found that this outcome must
                      be the result of a markedly concave or convex coast.



                         26. The phrase, “as a consequence of a concavity” in the ITLOS dic-
                      tum makes clear that the cut-off effect must result from a concavity, that
                      is, a geographical feature that causes an equidistance line to produce a
                      cut‑off effect, warranting its adjustment in order to achieve an equitable
                      result. The phrase has special significance in that it emphasizes the very
                      important causal role that the concavity plays in the equidistance line
                      producing a cut‑off effect. If a geographical feature that is a mere curva-
                      ture or an indentation rather than a concavity, produces a cut‑off effect,
                      then that effect is to be ignored, because to recognize it as capable of lead-
                      ing to an adjustment of the equidistance line would be to refashion geog-
                      raphy and an equitable solution would not be achieved. The well-known
                      proposition that maritime delimitation should not result in refashioning
                      geography is reflected in paragraph 172 of the Judgment.

                         27. It can be inferred from the ITLOS dictum (cited above in para-
                      graph 26) that it is not any and every geographical feature that will be
                      sufficient to constitute a relevant circumstance ; it is only a geographical
                      feature meeting the minimum requirement for a concavity and producing
                      a cut‑off effect that will constitute a relevant circumstance requiring
                      adjustment of the provisional equidistance line. Regrettably, the Special
                      Chamber’s decision in Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire is inconsistent with the Court’s
                      jurisprudence that an adjustment of the equidistance line is only required
                      when it produces a cut‑off effect as a result of a coastal feature that is
                      markedly concave. The effect of the Special Chamber’s ruling in that case
                      is that a coastal feature that would appear to be nothing more than a
                      mere curvature constituted a concavity. However, the Chamber only
                      found that there was a cut‑off effect when the convexity of the Ghanaian
                      coastline was also taken into account, and in any event, it found that the
                      cut-off did not warrant an adjustment of the equidistance line. The deci-
                      sion of the Arbitral Tribunal in Guinea/Guinea-­Bissau is also inconsistent
                      with the aforementioned jurisprudence of the Court.

                      effect that calls for an adjustment of the provisional equidistance line, of
                      the several coastal features considered in the previous paragraphs, it is
                      only those of Germany and Bangladesh that would appear to meet those
                      requirements. It is only those coastal features that can be said to be mark-
                      edly concave. As will be seen in the sketch-maps below (pp. 336-342), it is
                      those coastal features alone that, on their face, resemble a concavity in
                      that they possess a shape that is markedly hollowed or markedly rounded
                      inward like the inside of a bowl (Merriam-­Webster’s Dictionary). The
                      more relaxed view of what constitutes a concavity, evident in Ghana/
                      Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea/Guinea‑Bissau, has not displaced the clear find-

                      duces a cut‑off effect, calling for an adjustment of the provisional
                      equidistance line.
                         29. In the instant case, there must be a doubt as to whether the curva-
                      ture in the Kenyan coast or, for that matter, the curvature in the Somali,
                      Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts, has the degree of concavity sufficient to
                      result in the equidistance line producing a cut‑off effect, requiring an
                      adjustment of that line. Certainly, the greater part of the Kenyan
                      coastline may fairly be described as a slight curvature. Since, in the
                      ­
                      result, the Court has held this curvature to be a concavity, the reasonable
                      doubt that exists as to whether the feature constitutes a concavity means
                      that any cut‑off resulting would only warrant the slightest adjustment
                      of the equidistance line, because that line does not in any significant
                      way prevent Kenya from achieving its maximum maritime area in accor-
                      dance with international law ; in fact, the better view might very well be
                      that no adjustment is warranted since the cut‑off is neither serious nor
                      severe.
                         30. In considering the curvature in the Somali, Kenyan and Tanza-
                      nian coasts as part of what the Judgment describes as the “broader
                      geographical configuration”, the Court has followed the Tribunal’s
                      decision in Guinea/Guinea‑Bissau rather than its Judgment in Camer‑
                      oon v. Nigeria. In the former case, the Tribunal considered the coastline
                      of Guinea, Guinea‑Bissau and Sierra Leone together; in the latter case,
                      the Court was explicit in its finding that the Cameroonian concavity
                      could only be a relevant circumstance “when such concavity lies within
                      the area to be delimited” 14. In order to show that the Cameroonian
                      concavity did not meet that requirement, the Court observed that it was
                      not facing Nigeria, but rather, the island of Bioko, that belonged to a
                      third State, and was not within the area to be delimited. The Judgment
                      has wrongly seized on this reference by the Court to an island of a third
                      State to conclude that “the Court’s statement thus should not be under-
                      stood as excluding in all circumstances the consideration of the concavity

                      of a coastline in a broader geographical configuration”. But there is
                      nothing in the Court’s finding to suggest that it was embracing the
                      notion of a broader geographical configuration ; rather, in order to dis-
                      miss the Cameroonian claim that its concavity was a relevant circum-
                      stance, the Court merely observed that the concavity was located in a
                      third State, and that it was not a relevant circumstance since it was not
                      within the area to be delimited. Significantly, the Court referred to the
                      third State, not to take its concavity into account, but to exclude it
                      from the maritime delimitation between Cameroon and Nigeria on the
                      basis that it was not within the area to be delimited. In contrast, in the
                      instant case, the Court refers to the “concavity” of a third State, Tan-
                      zania, not to exclude it from the maritime delimitation between Soma-

                      that, in maritime delimitation, account should be taken of a concavity
                      that is not within the area to be delimited but is part of a so‑called
                      broader geographical configuration, is problematic. In the first place,
                      the concept of a “broader geographical configuration” is itself broad
                      and vague — where the configuration begins and ends is a legitimate
                      question. But the real danger is that the cut‑off effect may result more
                      from the geographical feature of a third State — not a party to the
                      dispute and not in the delimitation area — than from the geographical
                      feature on the coast of the State that is a party to the dispute and is
                      within the area to be delimited. This would appear to be so in the pres-
                      ent case because the Tanzanian “concavity”, that is not within the area
                      to be delimited, appears more pronounced than the Kenyan “concav-
                      ity”, that is within the area to be delimited. The odd result is a refash-
                      ioning of geography whereby an adjustment is made to the equidistance
                      line, more on account of a “concavity” in the Tanzanian coastline than
                      of the “concavity” in the Kenyan coastline — a result that is wholly
                      inconsistent with the Court’s finding in Cameroon v. Nigeria that, in
                      order to qualify as a relevant circumstance for the purpose of adjusting
                      the equidistance line, the concavity must be within the area to be delim-
                      ited 15. Somalia would appear to have been disadvantaged by reason of
                      a “concavity” that is not within the area to be delimited — an outcome
                      that can scarcely be described as equitable.



                        31. In support of its decision to take into account the “concavity” in
                      the Tanzanian coast as part of a broader geographical configuration, the
                      Court cites its finding in the 1969 North Sea Continental Shelf cases that
                      “although two separate delimitations were in question, they involved —

                      indeed actually g[a]ve rise to — a single situation” 16. However, there is an
                      important difference between those cases and the instant case. In the
                      1969 cases, the Court joined cases brought separately by Germany against
                      the Netherlands and against Denmark, with the result that the maritime
                      areas produced by the coasts of the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany
                      constituted the delimitation area. Thus, there was no question of the mar-
                      itime areas of the Netherlands and Denmark, between which the German
                      concavity lies, not being within the area to be delimited. In contrast, Tan-
                      zania is not a party to the dispute between Somalia and Kenya, and its
                      “concavity” is not within the area to be delimited. The need for a concav-
                      ity to be located within the area to be delimited, if it is to qualify as a
                      relevant factor requiring adjustment of the equidistance line, was reiter-
                      ated by the Court in Cameroon v. Nigeria.

                         32. There is another important distinction between the 1969 cases and
                      the instant case. As a result of the joinder, the Court had before it sub-
                      missions from the two adjacent coastal States, the Netherlands and Den-
                      mark. In contrast, in the instant case the Court has no submissions from
                      Tanzania, which is not a party to the dispute and whose “concavity” does
                      not lie within the area to be delimited.
                         33. In sum, the Court’s Judgment in the 1969 cases does not authorize
                      the proposition that in maritime delimitation account may be taken of a
                      concavity that is not within the area to be delimited merely because it falls

                      “single situation” to which the Court referred in the 1969 cases does not
                      eliminate the need for the concavity to fall within the area to be delimited
                      if it is to qualify as a relevant factor warranting an adjustment of the
                      provisional equidistance line.


                                 The Status of the 1927/1933 Treaty Arrangement

                         34. There is a question whether the Court has interpreted and applied
                      the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement. In order to address this question, the
                      following paragraphs of the Judgment must be examined. Paragraph 109
                      states: “In light of the above, the Court therefore considers it unnecessary
                      to decide whether the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement had as an objective
                      the delimitation of the boundary in the territorial sea.”

                      Paragraph 118 states:
                               “The Court observes that the course of the median line as described
                            in paragraph 117 corresponds closely to the course of a line ‘at right
                            angles to the general trend of the coastline’, assuming that the
                            1927/1933 treaty arrangement, in using this phrase, had as an objec-

                            tive to draw a line that continues into the territorial sea, a question
                            that the Court need not decide (see paragraph 109 above).”
                      Paragraph 214 (2) reads as follows:
                               “[The Court] . . . [d]ecides that the starting‑point of the single
                            ­ aritime boundary delimiting the respective maritime areas between
                            the Federal Republic of Somalia and the Republic of Kenya is the
                            intersection of the straight line extending from the final permanent
                            boundary beacon (PB 29) at right angles to the general direction of
                            the coast with the low‑water line, at the point with co‑ordinates
                            1° 39ʹ 44.0ʺ S and 41° 33ʹ 34.4ʺ E (WGS 84)[.]”
                          35. An examination of paragraphs 109 and 118 reveals that the Court
                      has interpreted the treaty arrangement. The Court could not have con-
                      cluded that there was a close correspondence between the median line as

                      general trend of the coastline” without examining and interpreting that
                      phrase, which is to be found in the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement. How-
                      ever, it might also be argued that, in this paragraph, the Court has not
                      only interpreted the colonial treaty but also applied it. This is not a view
                      that I share, but it cannot be ruled out of consideration. My own position
                      is that paragraph 214 (2) of the dispositif confirms that the Court has not
                      applied the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement because the starting-point
                      ­identified — “the intersection of the straight line extending from the final
                       permanent boundary beacon (PB 29) at right angles to the general direc-
                       tion of the coast with the low‑water line”, — is not the starting-point set
                      out in the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement. This paragraph of the dispositif
                       does not use the phrase “at right angles to the general trend of the coast-
                       line”, which is to be found in paragraph 118, and placed in quotation
                       marks to indicate that it is taken from the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement.
                       This paragraph, in its reference to the low‑water line as the starting-point
                       of the boundary, reflects Article 5 of the Convention, which is the appli-
                       cable law for the Parties, since both States are parties to that Convention.
                       Although it may be said that the formulation of this paragraph is influ-
                       enced by the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement, it cannot be concluded, that
                       in determining the starting-point the Court has applied the 1927/1933 treaty
                       arrangement.

                       Judgment relating to the territorial sea is replete with references to the
                       1927/1933 treaty arrangement, and although the Court has quite plainly
                       interpreted that treaty, there is nothing that explains how the Court is in
                       a position to take cognizance of this treaty.
                          37. The dispute brought before the Court relates to differences between
                       Somalia and Kenya. The 1927/1933 treaty arrangement relates to treaties
                       between Italy and United Kingdom. By what legal theory or jurispruden-
                       tial principle does the Court have the power to interpret the treaties
                       between Italy and the United Kingdom ? The Judgment does not explain





8 Ord_1229.indb 282                                                                                   5/12/22 08:28

                      how, in the absence of the Parties conferring jurisdiction on it in respect

                      must be an explanation as to how the colonial treaties between Italy and
                      the United Kingdom become relevant to the dispute between Somalia
                      and Kenya. It cannot even be maintained that there is a link between the
                      treaty arrangement and the dispute on the basis that both cover the same
                      geographical area, because the treaties establish a land boundary while
                      the dispute between the Parties relates to the sea. However, even if both
                      the treaties and the dispute covered the same geographical area, that
                      would not provide a sufficient link with Somalia and Kenya — States that
                      were not parties to the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement. Indeed, in relation
                      to Somalia and Kenya, the treaty is res inter alios acta. The closest that
                      the Judgment comes to discussing the relationship between the
                      1927/1933 treaty arrangement and the dispute is in paragraph 32. In that
                      paragraph, after outlining the various instruments described as the
                      1927/1933 treaty arrangement between Italy and the United Kingdom,
                      there is a terse reference to Somalia and Kenya gaining their indepen-
                      dence in 1960 and 1963 respectively. However, no link is made between
                      the colonial treaties and the attainment of independence between Somalia
                      and Kenya.
                         38. There was adopted in 1978 the United Nations Convention on

                      “1978 Vienna Convention”). It defines a succession of States as “the
                      replacement of one State by another in the responsibility for the interna-
                      tional relations of territory”.
                         39. The 1978 Vienna Convention required ratification by 15 States to
                      enter into force. Following its adoption, the treaty took 18 years to enter
                      into force and today, 43 years after its adoption, it only has 23 States par-
                      ties or about 12 per cent of the membership of the United Nations. Obvi-
                      ously it has not gained any significant support. The reason is explained
                      below.
                         40. By virtue of that Convention a newly independent State begins its
                      life free from any obligation to continue or maintain the treaties of its
                      predecessor, but with an entitlement to continue or maintain those trea-
                      ties if it so wishes. This principle is reflected in Article 16 which provides
                      that “[a] newly independent State is not bound to maintain in force, or to
                      become a party to, any treaty by reason only of the fact that at the date
                      of the succession of States the treaty was in force in respect of the terri-
                      tory to which the succession of States relates”. In my view, the provision
                      is protective of the sovereignty of the newly independent States because it
                      does not impose an obligation on them to continue the treaties of a pre-
                      decessor State and at the same time it leaves those States with an entitle-
                      ment to continue those treaties if they wish.
                         41. Notwithstanding the apparent potential of Article 16 to attract
                      newly independent States to ratify the 1978 Convention, only few have
                      done so. In the Caribbean, for example, only Dominica and Saint Vin-
                      cent and the Grenadines are parties and from Africa only Egypt, Ethio-





8 Ord_1229.indb 284                                                                                    5/12/22 08:28

                      347 	            maritime delimitation (ind. op. robinson)

                      pia, Liberia, Morocco, Seychelles and Tunisia are parties. Somalia and
                      Kenya are not parties. There is obviously a strong antipathy to this Con-
                      vention on the part of the vast number of developing countries that
                      became independent after 1960. The overriding reason for this opposition
                      is Article 11 which provides that “[a] succession of States does not as such
                      affect: (a) a boundary established by a treaty ; or (b) obligations and
                      rights established by a treaty and relating to the regime of a boundary”.
                      Therefore, to the extent that the 1927 Agreement established a boundary,
                      that boundary is not affected as such by the succession of States that took
                      place on the independence of Somalia and Kenya. The significance of the
                      phrase “as such” is that — as the International Law Commission’s Com-
                      mentary indicates — Article 11 “relate[s] exclusively to the effect of the

                      any other ground of claiming the revision [of the treaty] or setting aside
                      of the boundary settlement, whether self‑determination or the invalidity
                      or termination of the treaty” 17. In my view, the 1927/1933 treaty arrange-
                      ment did not establish a boundary in the territorial sea.


                         42. Article 11 of the 1978 Vienna Convention provides for an excep-
                      tion to the general rule in Article 16 that a newly independent State is not
                      bound to maintain the treaties of its predecessor, but may do so if it
                      wishes. Newly independent States did not wish to bind themselves to a
                      treaty that obligated them to maintain boundaries established by their
                      predecessor States. Nonetheless the Organization of African Unity

                      existing on their achievement of national independence” 18, and many
                      argue that there is a customary rule of international law requiring respect
                      for such borders.

                         43. The Judgment does not determine whether the 1927/1933 treaty
                      arrangement establishes a boundary in the territorial sea. It is patent that
                      the Judgment seeks to adopt an approach that would arrive at a conclu-
                      sion about the delimitation of the territorial sea without any reference to
                      the colonial treaties. Nonetheless, as is evident in paragraphs 109 and 118,
                      the Judgment does not seem capable of escaping references to those trea-
                      ties.
                         44. If the jurisprudential basis for the Court’s interpretation of the
                      treaty arrangement is not the principle of a succession of States, reflected
                      in the 1978 Vienna Convention, then in my view, it must be that the colo-
                      nial treaties between Italy and the United Kingdom become relevant to

                      pendent in 1960, it assumed sovereignty over territory in respect of which
                      Italy formerly exercised sovereignty ; in particular, it assumed responsibil-

                      larly, when Kenya became independent in 1963, it assumed sovereignty
                      over territory in respect of which the United Kingdom formerly exercised
                      sovereignty ; in particular it assumed responsibility for the conduct of for-

                      foreign relations, including whether to maintain the treaties entered into
                      by Italy and the United Kingdom in respect of the territory over which
                      they now exercise sovereignty. This is confirmed by Article 2 of resolu-
                      tion 1514 (XV) which provides that “[a]ll peoples have the right to self-­
                      determination ; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political

                      already a rule of customary international law at the time of the indepen-
                      dence of Somalia and Kenya.


                         45. In response to a question by a Member of the Court, Somalia
                      stated that “[n]either [it] nor Kenya, since their independence and at all
                      times thereafter, has ever claimed that the maritime boundary in the ter-
                      ritorial sea follows a line perpendicular to the coast at Dar es Salaam, for
                      any distance”. It further added that neither Party accepted nor argued for
                      the 1927 Agreement as binding on them in regard to a maritime bound-
                      ary, for any distance. In exercise of their sovereignty and independence
                      Somalia and Kenya had the right to determine their relationship with the
                      colonial treaties, that is, whether they accepted or rejected them. These

                      non‑acceptance of the colonial treaties, classically reflect the exercise of
                      the right to self‑determination by newly independent States. Conse-
                      quently, those treaties are inapplicable in the determination of the mari-
                      time dispute between Somalia and Kenya. Since those treaties did not
                      establish a boundary in the territorial sea, the question whether there is
                      an obligation under customary international law to respect boundaries
                      that existed at independence does not arise.

                                                    Acquiescence

                          46. Acquiescence, like the kindred concept of estoppel, owes its place
                      in international law primarily to Anglo‑American law. In international
                      law, acquiescence applies to cases where, although a State’s consent has
                      not been expressly given to a course of conduct by another State, an
                      inference may be drawn that the State’s silence denotes its consent to that
                      conduct, that is, its agreement with that conduct. Thus, the primary task
                      in acquiescence is to determine the circumstances in which it is permissi-
                      ble to infer from a State’s silence its consent or agreement with the con-
                      duct of another State. In that regard, an essential evidentiary requirement
                      for acquiescence to apply is that the inference of State consent from its
                      silence may only be drawn if the circumstances are such that a response is
                      called for. This is the most important element in the law of acquiescence.
                          47. It is settled that for acquiescence to apply there must be an exami-
                      nation of the conduct of the State claiming acquiescence to determine
                      whether it is clear and consistent and, as a consequence, calls for a
                      response from the alleged acquiescing State. Thus, the initial focus is on
                      the conduct of the State claiming acquiescence with a view to deciding

                          48. Kenya captures very well the meaning of acquiescence in para-
                      graph 210 of its Counter‑Memorial when it argued that “the absence of
                      protest when a response is called for constitutes acquiescence”. Kenya is
                      correct. That is the law. Kenya’s submission reflects the requirement that
                      it is only when a response is called for to the conduct of the State claiming
                      acquiescence and that response is not forthcoming, that an inference may
                      be drawn that silence signifies consent with the conduct of the State claim-
                      ing acquiescence. It is true that in its pleadings Kenya examines the con-
                      duct of the alleged acquiescing State, Somalia, but it carries out this
                      examination on the basis that, in its view, its own conduct called for a
                      response from Somalia — a response that, it maintains, was not given.
                      Thus, in paragraph 208 of its Counter‑Memorial, Kenya alludes to the
                      Kenyan proclamations of 1979 and 2005, arguing that they clearly and
                      unambiguously reflected Kenya’s position on a maritime boundary with
                      Somalia at a parallel of latitude. Kenya submits that Somalia was aware
                      of these proclamations and, if it had an objection, it should have pro-
                      tested. But Kenya’s position is not that it is necessary ab initio to examine
                      Somalia’s conduct to determine whether there has been acquiescence.
                      Rather, its position, consistent with its submission that the absence of
                      protest when a reaction is called for constitutes acquiescence, is that its
                      own conduct, such as the issuance of the proclamations of 1979 and 2005,

                      Somalia’s silence may be taken to signify its consent or agreement with its
                      conduct. Thus, every submission made by Kenya that an examination of
                      Somalia’s conduct shows that Somalia failed to protest when a response
                      was called for must be considered against the background of its main
                      proposition that its own conduct was clear and consistent, and therefore





8 Ord_1229.indb 290                                                                                   5/12/22 08:28

                      called for a response from Somalia. In other words, Kenya’s own position
                      is that an examination of Somalia’s conduct is consequential and depen-
                      dent on a finding that a response was called for from Somalia — a posi-
                      tion that is wholly consistent with the law of acquiescence. In this regard,
                      the Court appears to have misinterpreted Kenya’s position.

                        49. Kenya’s proposition that the absence of protest when a response is

                      Court. In Pedra Branca the Court found that “silence may also speak, but
                      only if the conduct of the other State calls for a response” 20. Here the
                      Court reflects the strong evidentiary requirement, implicit in the words
                      “only if”, that an inference of consent may only be drawn if the conduct
                      of the State claiming acquiescence calls for a response. It may be observed
                      that this strong evidentiary requirement is consistent with the substantive
                      law that the evidence of acquiescence must be compelling.

                         50. There is an inherent conflict between the Court’s finding in para-
                      graph 71 and its finding in paragraph 72. After examining the conduct of
                      Kenya, the Judgment concludes in paragraph 71 “that Kenya has not
                      consistently maintained its claim that the parallel of latitude constitutes
                      the single maritime boundary with Somalia”. In effect the Court con-
                      cluded that, by virtue of the inconsistency of Kenya’s conduct, no
                      response was called for by Somalia ; consequently, the Court should have
                      dismissed the claim. There was no need to move on to determine whether
                      Somalia clearly and consistently accepted a maritime boundary at the
                      parallel of latitude (para. 72) ; to do so undermines the earlier finding that
                      Kenya’s conduct was not consistent and, consequently, no response was
                      called for by Somalia. The conflict between paragraphs 71 and 72 is evi-
                      dent because, if Kenya did not consistently maintain its claim, it would be

                      consistently have acquiesced to. This explains why the most important
                      aspect of the law on acquiescence is an examination of the conduct of the
                      State claiming acquiescence to determine whether that conduct requires a
                      response. In particular the Court’s approach flies in the face of the finding
                      in paragraph 71 that “it was reasonable for Somalia to understand that
                      its maritime boundary with Kenya in the territorial sea, in the exclusive
                      economic zone and on the continental shelf would be established by an
                      agreement to be negotiated and concluded in the future”. If it is reason-
                      able for Somalia to have this understanding, it is difficult to appreciate
                      why the Court would go on to examine whether Somalia clearly and con-
                      sistently accepted a maritime boundary at the parallel of latitude. This is
                      so because the Court could only have made this finding on the basis that
                      it had rejected Kenya’s claim of Somalia’s acquiescence to a boundary

                      along a parallel of latitude — all the more reason why an enquiry into
                      Somalia’s conduct was unnecessary.


                         51. Having carried out its examination of Somalia’s conduct, the Court
                       concludes that the conduct of Somalia between 1979 and 2014 did not
                      demonstrate “Somalia’s clear and consistent acceptance of a maritime
                      boundary at the parallel of latitude” (para. 80). An examination of the
                      logic of this conclusion shows why the Court’s approach is questionable.
                      Had the finding been that there was evidence demonstrating Somalia’s
                      clear and consistent acceptance of a maritime boundary along a parallel
                      of latitude, it would be impossible to reconcile that finding with the
                      ­earlier conclusion in paragraph 71 not only that Kenya’s conduct did not
                       require a response from Somalia, but also that it was reasonable for
                       Somalia to expect that on the basis of Kenya’s conduct its maritime
                       boundary with that State would be established on the basis of agreement.

                       paragraph 80 ; after its finding in paragraph 71, the Court should have
                       dismissed Kenya’s claim. In my view, it reflects a wrong reading not only
                       of the law, but also of Kenya’s own submission. Properly understood,
                       Kenya’s own submission proceeds on the basis that the evidentiary hurdle
                       of a required response must first be cleared before undertaking any exam-
                       ination of Somalia’s acceptance of a maritime boundary along a parallel
                       of latitude. Since the Court has found that no such response was required
                       the question of an examination of Somalia’s conduct does not arise.
