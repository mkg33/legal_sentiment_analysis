“When, however, as in the present case, the Court comes to the
conclusion that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the claims made
in the Application, it can make no finding, nor any observation
whatever, on the question whether any such violation has been com-
mitted or any international responsibility incurred.”

“55. There is a fundamental distinction between the acceptance
by a State of the Court’s jurisdiction and the compatibility of par-
ticular acts with international law. The former requires consent. The
latter question can only be reached when the Court deals with the
merits, after having established its jurisdiction and having heard full
legal argument by both parties.

56. Whether or not States accept the jurisdiction of the Court,
they remain in all cases responsible for acts attributable to them that
violate the rights of other States.” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.
Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 456.)

1. The Court finds that it has no jurisdiction in this case because the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)! did not have access to the Court
at the time it filed its Application. The first ground upon which the
Court makes this finding is Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
Court.

2. Article 35, paragraph 1, provides that “[t]he Court shall be open to
the States parties to the present Statute”. Under Article 93, paragraph 1,
of the United Nations Charter, all “Members of the United Nations are
ipso facto [States] parties”. The Court holds that the FRY was not a
State party to the Statute because the FRY was not a Member of the
United Nations at the time it filed its Application in the instant case, and
therefore, in the view of the Court, the Court was not “open” to the
FRY. Because, in my view, the FRY was a Member of the United
Nations when it filed its Application, I disagree.

6. In September 1992, the Security Council and the General Assembly
each adopted a resolution declaring “that the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the mem-
bership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the
United Nations” 4. These resolutions did not suspend the membership of
the FRY in the United Nations in accordance with Article 5 of the Char-
ter. Nor did either resolution have the effect of expelling the FRY from
the United Nations in accordance with Article 6 of the Charter. Earlier,
the Council, on 30 May 1992, had adopted a resolution® imposing eco-
nomic and other sanctions on the FRY — meaning that the conditions
for invoking the provisions of Article 6 existed — yet the FRY was not
expelled.

7. This fact was recognized by the United Nations Legal Counsel, who
on 29 September 1992, addressed a letter to the Permanent Representa-
tives of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which the “considered

view of the United Nations Secretariat regarding the practical conse-
quences of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 47/1” was
stated to be as follows:

“While the General Assembly has stated unequivocally that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot
automatically continue the membership of the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations and that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should
apply for membership in the United Nations, the only practical
consequence that the resolution draws is that the Federal Repub-
lic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall not participate
in the work of the General Assembly. It is clear, therefore, that
representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) can no longer participate in the work of the General
Assembly, its subsidiary organs, nor conferences and meetings con-

vened by it.
On the other hand, the resolution neither terminates nor suspends
Yugoslavia’s membership in the Organization . . . The resolution

does not take away the right of Yugoslavia to participate in the
work of organs other than Assembly bodies.” $

10. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY), when it also considered the question whether the FRY was a
member of the United Nations during this period, reached the same con-
clusion. It held that:

“Resolution 47/1 did not deprive the FRY of all the attributes of
United Nations membership: the only practical consequence was its
inability to participate in the work of the General Assembly, its sub-
sidiary organs, conferences or meetings convened by it. Apart from
that, it continued to function as a member of the United Nations in
many areas of the work of the United Nations . . . Thus, while the
FRY’s membership was lost for certain purposes, it was retained for
others . . . The proper approach to the issue of the FRY membership
of the United Nations in the period between 1992 and 2000 is not
one that proceeds on a[n] a priori, doctrinaire assumption that its
exclusion from participation in the work of the General Assembly
necessarily meant that it was no longer a member of the United
Nations. As the FRY membership was neither terminated nor sus-
pended by General Assembly resolution 47/1, it is more appropriate
to make a determination of its United Nations membership in that
period on an empirical, functional and case-by-case basis.” 8

ber 20001°, as was found in the 2003 Application for Revision case,

“cannot have changed retroactively the sui generis position which the
FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United Nations over the period
1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court”
(Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the
Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections ( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia
and Herzegovina), Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 71;
emphasis added).

13. The Court has now characterized the FRY’s sui generis position as
one that “could not have amounted to its membership in the Organiza-
tion” (Judgment, para. 77) and held that the FRY’s admission to the
United Nations in 2000 “did not have and could not have had, the effect
of dating back to the time when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia broke up and disappeared” (ibid. ). This, in my view, lacks a solid
legal basis. Whereas the Security Council and General Assembly were
acting in a political capacity when the relevant resolutions were adopted,
the Court, throughout the various phases of the cases related to the
former Yugoslavia, should have consistently stated and applied the appli-

III. ACCESS To THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE 35,
PARAGRAPH 2

1. The FRY did not invoke Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s
Statute as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. The Court decided proprio
motu to address it!?, holding that the FRY, as a non-party to the Statute,
could not invoke a treaty which entered into force after the entry into
force of the Statute as a basis for access to the Court under Article 35,
paragraph 2. I have explained the reasons for my disagreement with the
Court’s conclusion that the FRY was not a Member of the United
Nations in 1999. However, assuming that it was a non-Member, I also
cannot agree that it would not have access to the Court under the pro-
visions of Article 35, paragraph 2.

2. Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute provides that:

“The conditions under which the Court shall be open to other
States shall, subject to the special provisions contained in treaties in
force, be laid down by the Security Council, but in no case shall such
conditions place the parties in a position of inequality before the
Court.”

4. In respect of the first question, I agree with the Court’s previous
finding that

“proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,
LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 19; emphasis added) !3.

that

“[a]s for the words ‘treaties in force’, in their natural and ordinary
meaning they do not indicate at what date the treaties contemplated
are to be in force, and thus they may lend themselves to different
interpretations. One can construe those words as referring to treaties
which were in force at the time that the Statute itself came into force,
as was contended by certain Respondents; or to those which were in
force on the date of the institution of proceedings in a case in which
such treaties are invoked. In favour of this latter interpretation, it
may be observed that the similar expression ‘treaties and conven-
tions in force’ is found in Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute, and
the Court has interpreted it in this sense . . . The expression ‘treaty
or convention in force’ in Article 37 of the Statute has also been read
as meaning in force at the date proceedings were instituted.” (Judg-
ment, para. 103; internal citations omitted.)

13 See also League of Nations, Records of the First Assembly, Meetings of the Com-
mittees, Third Committee, Annex 7, Report Submitted to the Third Committee by
M. Hagerup on behalf of the Sub-Committee, p. 532:

“The access of other [non-members of the League of Nations] States to the Court
will depend either on the special provisions of the Treaties in force (for example the
provisions of the Treaties of Peace concerning the rights of minorities, labour, etc.) or
else on a resolution of the Council.” (Emphasis added.)



7. Even assuming — without deciding # — that the Court is correct in
holding that the term “treaties in force” should be given a more restric-
tive interpretation than the interpretation it is given when it appears in
Articles 36 and 37, in my view the interpretation adopted by the Court —
limiting “treaties in force” to treaties in force at the time the Court’s
Statute came into force — is unduly restrictive.

8. The Court’s interpretation of “treaties in force” is primarily based
on statements in the travaux préparatoires of the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice (PCIT), which contained the original,
and substantially identical, provision. These statements suggest to the
Court that when considering the term “treaties in force” in Article 35,
paragraph 2, the provision’s drafters had in mind the peace treaties with
former First World War enemy States (who were not Members of the
League of Nations and would otherwise not have access to the Court)
concluded before the entry into force of the Court’s Statute.

9. However, there is evidence from the discussion of the Statute’s
drafters that such a narrow interpretation is not warranted. The peace
treaties were considered to encompass all “Treaties of Peace dealing with
the rights of minorities, labour, etc.” 1° including any “Treaties other than
the German Treaty [that] form[ed] part of the general peace settlement” 16
and provided for judicial dispute settlement. This interpretation was con-
firmed in 1926 when the Court was considering amendments to the
Court’s Rules. At this juncture it was stated that Article 35 related to
“situations provided for by the treaties of peace” (1926, P.C.LJ., Series D,
No. 2, Add., Acts and Documents, p. 106; emphasis added). And “it was
decided . . . not to lay down, once and for all, in what cases” such treaties

and the PCIJ’s jurisdiction was derived from the German-Polish Conven-
tion relating to Upper Silesia, which was concluded after the adoption of
the PCIJ Statute. Poland did not dispute the fact that the suit had been
duly submitted to the Court under Article 35, and the Court found itself,
on the basis of the treaty alone — (Germany had not complied with the
conditions laid down by the Council of the League of Nations) — able to
exercise jurisdiction over the parties to the case.

succeeded to these treaties even in the absence of such a declaration
because a successor State that separates from a predecessor State is
not entitled, upon separation, to disavow the treaty obligations of the
predecessor State. The entitlement to pick and choose treaty obligations
applies only to newly independent States in conformity with Article 17,
paragraph 1, of the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect
of Treaties. Article 17, paragraph 1, provides that

“a newly independent State may, by a notification of succession,
establish its status as a party to any multilateral treaty which at the
date of the succession of States was in force in respect of the terri-
tory to which the succession of States relates”.

Article 34 of the Vienna Convention, on the other hand, provides that

“[w]lhen a part or parts of the territory of a State separate to form
one or more States, whether or not the predecessor State continues
to exist:

(a) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect of the entire territory of the predecessor State continues
in force in respect of each successor State so formed[, and]

(b) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect only of that part of the territory of the predecessor State
which has become a successor State continues in force in respect
of that successor State alone”.

5. Thus, there is a difference in international law between a newly
independent State and a successor State. A newly independent State is
required upon independence to clarify its legal position regarding treaties
in conformity with the “clean slate” doctrine codified in Article 17 of the
Vienna Convention. In the case of the separation of States, on the other
hand, the successor State automatically assumes the treaty obligations of
the predecessor.

distinction when he stated that:

“a separated state which was not a colony is presumed to succeed
to the treaty obligations and rights of the predecessor state unless
this result would be incompatible with the object of the treaty. The
experience thus far with respect to the cases of the former Soviet
Union and the former Yugoslavia supports a general presumption
of continuity. That presumption would not, however, apply to
membership in the United Nations or other general international
organizations that provide for the election of new members.” 3


For this and other reasons set out in my opinion, I disagree with the
findings of the Court regarding the interpretation of Article 35, para-
graph 1, which the joint declaration correctly describes as being “at
odds” with the Court’s previous judgments and orders. I also do not
agree with the grounds chosen by the Court to reach its decision that
it lacks jurisdiction or its substantive conclusions on the scope of
Article 35, paragraph 2. Moreover I find that the approach adopted
by the Court casts an unnecessary shadow of doubt on the Genocide Con-
vention case which has been on the docket of the Court since 1993.

However, because I consider that the Court does not have jurisdiction
ratione materiae, 1 find myself in agreement with the dispositif contained
in paragraph 119 of the Judgment, which states that the Court “//Jinds
that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the Application
filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999”. 1 was therefore able
to vote in favour of the Judgment.
