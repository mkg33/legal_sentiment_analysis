has only three questions to consider on the merits:

(1) The existence in 1954 of a right of passage in Portugal's
favour to the extent necessary for the exercise of its sovereignty
over the enclaves, exercise of that right being regulated and con-
trolled by India;

(2) Failure by India in 1954 to fulfil its obligation in regard to

and connected relevant documents establish, on the other hand,
that what was granted to the Portuguese was only a revenue tenure
called a jagir or saranjam of the value of 12,000 rupees a year. This
was a very common form of grant in India and not a single in-
stance has been brought to the notice of the Court in which such a
grant has been construed as amounting to a cession of territory in
sovereignty.

It is argued that the Portuguese were granted authority to put
down revolt or rebellion in the assigned villages and that this is an
indication that they were granted sovereignty over the villages.
The Court does not consider that this conclusion is well-founded. If


Having regard to the view that the Court has taken of the charac-
ter of the Maratha grant in favour of the Portuguese, the situation
during the Maratha period need not detain the Court further in its
consideration of Portugal's claim of a right of passage to and from
the enclaves. During the Maratha period sovereignty over the
villages comprised in the grant, as well as over the intervening
territory between coastal Daman and the villages, vested in the
Marathas. There could, therefore, be no question of any enclave or
of any right of passage for the purpose of exercising sovereignty
over enclaves. The fact that the Portuguese had access to the villages



for the purpose of collecting revenue and in pursuit of that purpose
exercised such authority as had been delegated to them by the
Marathas cannot, in the view of the Court, be equated to a right
of passage for the exercise of sovereignty.

* *

It is clear from a study of the material placed before the Court
that the situation underwent a change with the advent of the
British as sovereign of that part of the country in place of the
Marathas. The British found the Portuguese in occupation of the
villages and exercising full and exclusive administrative authority
over them. They accepted the situation as they found it and left the
Portuguese in occupation of, and in exercise of exclusive authority
over, the villages. The Portuguese held themselves out as sovereign
over the villages. The British did not, as successors of the Marathas,
themselves claim sovereignty, nor did they accord express recog-
nition of Portuguese sovereignty, over them. The exclusive authority
of the Portuguese over the villages was never brought in question.
Thus Portuguese sovereignty over the villages was recognized by
the British in fact and by implication and was subsequently tacitly
recognized by India. As a consequence the villages comprised in the
Maratha grant acquired the character of Portuguese enclaves within
Indian territory.

.For the purpose of determining whether Portugal has established
the right of passage claimed by it, the Court must have regard to
what happened during the British and post-British periods. During
these periods, there had developed between the Portuguese and the
territorial sovereign with regard to passage to the enclaves a practice
upon which Portugal relies for the purpose of establishing the right
of passage claimed by it.

With regard to Portugal’s claim of a right of passage as formulated
by it on the basis of local custom, it is objected on behalf of India
that no local custom could be established between only two States.
It is difficult to see why the number of States between which a
local custom may be established on the basis of long practice must
necessarily be larger than two. The Court sees no reason why long
continued practice between two States accepted by them as
regulating their relations should not form the basis of mutual rights
and obligations between the two States.

As already stated, Portugal claims a right of passage to the extent
necessary for the exercise of its sovereignty over the enclaves, with-
out any immunity and subject to the regulation and control of
India. In the course of the written and oral proceedings, the exis-
tence of the right was discussed with reference to the different
categories making up the right, namely private persons, civil
officials, goods in general, armed forces, armed police, and arms and



ammunition. The Court will proceed to examine whether such a
right as is claimed by Portugal is established on the basis of the.
practice that prevailed between the Parties during the British and

Goods in general, that is to say, all merchandise other than arms
and ammunition, also passed freely between Daman and the en-
claves during the periods in question, subject only, at certain times,
to customs regulations and such regulation and control as were
necessitated by considerations of security or revenue. The general
prohibition of the transit of goods during the Second World War
and prohibitions imposed upon the transit of salt and, on certain
occasions, upon that of liquor and materials for the distillation of
liquor, were specific measures necessitated by the considerations
just referred to. The scope and purpose of each prohibition were
clearly defined. In all other cases the passage of goods was free. No
authorization or licence was required,

The Court, therefore, concludes that, with regard to private
persons, civil officials and goods in general there existed during the
British and post-British periods a constant and uniform practice
allowing free passage between Daman and the enclaves. This practice
having continued over a period extending beyond a century and a
quarter unaffected by the change of regime in respect of the inter-
vening territory which occurred when India became independent,
the Court is, in view of all the circumstances of the case, satisfied
that that practice was accepted as law by the Parties and has given
rise to a right and a correlative obligation.

The Court therefore holds that Portugal had in 1954 a right of
passage over intervening Indian territory between coastal Daman
and the enclaves and between the enclaves, in respect of private
persons, civil officials and goods in general, to the extent necessary,
as claimed by Portugal, for the exercise of its sovereignty over the
enclaves, and subject to the regulation and control of India.

As regards armed forces, armed police and arms and ammunition,
the position is different.

It appears that during the British period up to 1878 passage of
armed forces and armed police between British and Portuguese
possessions was regulated on a basis of reciprocity. No distinction
appears to have been made in this respect with regard to passage
between Daman and the enclaves. There is nothing to show that
passage of armed forces and armed police between Daman and the



enclaves or between the enclaves was permitted or exercised as of
right.

Paragraph 3 of Article XVIII of the Treaty of Commerce and
Extradition of 26 December 1878 between Great Britain and
Portugal laid down that the armed forces of the two Governments
should not enter the Indian dominions of the other, except for the
purposes specified in former Treaties, or for the rendering of mutual
assistance as provided for in the Treaty itself, or in consequence of
a formal request made by the Party desiring such entry. Subsequent
correspondence between the British and Portuguese authorities in
India shows that this provision was applicable to passage between
Daman and the enclaves.

It is argued on behalf of Portugal that on twenty-three occasions
during the years 1880-1889 Portuguese armed forces crossed British
territory between Daman and the enclaves without obtaining per-
mission. In this connection, it should be observed that on 8 Decem-
ber 18go the Government of Bombay forwarded to the Government
of Portuguese India a complaint to the effect that “armed men in
the service of the Portuguese Government are in the habit of
passing without formal request through a portion of the British
Pardi taluka of Surat en route from Daman to Nagar Haveli and
back again. It would appear that the provisions of Article XVIII
of the Treaty are thus violated.” In his letter of 22 December 1890
addressed to the Governor of Bombay, the Governor-General of
Portuguese India stated: “On so delicate a subject I request leave
to observe that Portuguese troops never cross British territory
without previous permission’, and went on to add: “For centuries
has this practice been followed, whereby the treaties have been
respected and due deference shown to the British Authorities.” The
statement that this practice concerning the passage of armed forces
from the territory of one State to that of the other had continued
over a long period even before the enclaves came into existence
finds support, for instance, in a Treaty of 1741 between the Marathas
and the Portuguese which contained the following provision: “A


The Court is not concerned with the question whether any vio-
lation of the relevant provision of the Treaty in fact took place.
Whether any such violation did or did not take place, the legal
position with regard to the passage of armed forces between Daman
and the enclaves appears clearly from this correspondence.

The requirement of a formal request before passage of armed
forces could take place was repeated in an agreement of 1913.

With regard to armed police, the position was similar to that of
armed forces. The Treaty of 1878 regulated the passage of armed
police on the basis of reciprocity. Paragraph 2 of Article XVIII of
the Treaty made provision for the entry of the police authorities
of the parties into the territories of the other party for certain
specific purposes, e.g., the pursuit of criminals and persons engaged
in smuggling and contraband practices, on a reciprocal basis. An
agreement of 1913 established an arrangement providing for a
reciprocal concession permitting parties of armed police to cross
intervening territory, provided previous intimation was given. An
agreement of 1920 provided that armed police below a certain rank
should not enter the territory of the other party without consent
previously obtained.

An agreement of 1940 concerning passage of Portuguese armed
police over the Daman-Silvassa (Nagar-Aveli) road provided that,
if the party did not exceed ten in number, intimation of its passage
should be given to the British authorities within twenty-four hours
after passage had taken place, but that “If any number exceeding
ten at a time are required so to travel at any time the existing
practice should be followed and concurrence of the British authori-
ties should be obtained by prior notice as heretofore.”

Both with regard to armed forces and armed police, no change
took place during the post-British period after India became
independent.

It would thus appear that, during the British and post-British
periods, Portuguese armed forces and armed police did not pass
between Daman and the enclaves as of right and that, after 1878,
such passage could only take place with previous authorization by
the British and later by India, accorded either under a reciprocal
arrangement already agreed to, or in individual cases. Having regard
to the special circumstances of the case, this necessity for autho-
rization before passage could take place constitutes, in the view
of the Court, a negation of passage as of right. The practice
predicates that the territorial sovereign had the discretionary
power to withdraw or to refuse permission. It is argued that per-
mission was always granted, but this does not, in the opinion of
the Court, affect the legal position. There is nothing in the record



to show that grant of permission was incumbent on the British
or on India as an obligation.

As regards arms and ammunition, paragraph 4 of Article XVIII
of the Treaty of 1878 provided that the exportation of arms, ammu-
nition or military stores from the territories of one party to those
of the other ‘‘shall not be permitted, except with the consent of,
and under rules approved of by, the latter”.

Rule 7 A, added in 1880 to the rules framed under the Indian
Arms Act of 1878, provided that ‘nothing in rules 5, 6, or 7 shall be
deemed to authorize the grant of licences … to import any arms,
ammunition or military stores from Portuguese India, [or] to export
to Portuguese India … [such objects]... except … by a special
licence”. Subsequent practice shows that this provision applied to
transit between Daman and the enclaves.

There was thus established a clear distinction between the practice
permitting free passage of private persons, civil officials and goods
in general, and the practice requiring previous authorization, as
in the case of armed forces, armed police, and arms and ammu-
nition.

The Court is, therefore, of the view that no right of passage in
favour of Portugal involving a correlative obligation on India has
been established in respect of armed forces, armed police, and arms
and ammunition. The course of dealings established between the
Portuguese and the British authorities with respect to the passage
of these categories excludes the existence of any such right. The
practice that was established shows that, with regard to these cate-
gories, it was well understood that passage could take place only by
permission of the British authorities. This situation continued
during the post-British period.

intervening Indian territory between Daman and the enclaves in
respect of private persons, civil officials and goods in general, the
Court will proceed to consider whether India has acted contrary to
its obligation resulting from Portugal's right of passage in respect
of any of these categories.

Portugal complains of the progressive restriction of its right of
passage between October 1953 and July 1954. It does not, however,

It may be observed that the Governor of Daman was granted the
necessary visas for a journey to and back from Dadra as late as
21 July 1954.

The events that took place in Dadra on 21-22 July 1954 resulted
in the overthrow of Portuguese authority in that enclave. This
created tension in the surrounding Indian territory. Thereafter all
passage was suspended by India. India contends that this became
necessary in view of the abnormal situation which had arisen in
Dadra and the tension created in surrounding Indian territory.

On 26 July the Portuguese Government requested that delegates
of the Governor of Daman (if necessary limited to three) should be



enabled to go to Nagar-Aveli in order to enter into contact with the
population, examine the situation and take the necessary admini-
strative measures on the spot. The request stated that if possible
this delegation would also visit Dadra and examine the situation
there. It mentioned that the delegation could be routed directly to
Nagar-Aveli from Daman and need not necessarily pass through

Government of India regret that they cannot entertain the demand
of the Portuguese authorities for facilities to enable them to send a
delegation from Daman to Dadra and Nagar-Aveli across Indian
territory.”

In view of the tension then prevailing in intervening Indian
territory, the Court is unable to hold that India’s refusal of passage
to the proposed delegation and its refusal of visas to Portuguese
nationals of European origin and to native Indian Portuguese in the
employ of the Portuguese Government was action contrary to its
