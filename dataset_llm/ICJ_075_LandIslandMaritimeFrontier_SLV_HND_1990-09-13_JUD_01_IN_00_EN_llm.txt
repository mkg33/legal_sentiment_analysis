procedural mandate of the full Court”.

15. By an Order dated 28 February 1990, the Court, after considering the
written observations of the Parties on the question thus raised, whether the
Application for permission to intervene was to be decided upon by the full
Court or by the Chamber, and the observations of Nicaragua in response to
those observations, stated that

“the question whether an application for permission to intervene in a case
under Article 62 of the Statute should be granted requires a judicial deci-
sion whether the State seeking to intervene ‘has an interest of a legal nature
which may be affected by the decision’ in the case, and can therefore only
be determined by the body which will be called upon to give the decision
on the merits of the case”;

and found that it was for the Chamber formed to deal with the present case to
decide whether the Application by Nicaragua for permission to intervene under
Article 62 of the Statute should be granted.

16. Pursuant to Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the two Parties
were on 5 March 1990 invited to furnish their written observations on the Appli-



cation for permission to intervene filed by Nicaragua on 17 November 1989.
Both Parties submitted such observations within the time-limit fixed by the
President of the Chamber. Honduras stated that it would see no objection to
Nicaragua being permitted to intervene for the sole purpose of presenting its
views on the legal status of the waters within the Gulf of Fonseca; El Salvador
- requested the Chamber to deny the permission sought by Nicaragua.

English or French, notwithstanding the fact that the Special Agreement
itself provides (Art. 4) for the proceedings to be conducted in English or
French. For the purposes of the present Judgment, however, the Chamber
considers that it can make use of the following translation of Article 2,
prepared by the Registry of the Court:

“The Parties request the Chamber:

1. To delimit the frontier line in the areas or sections not described
in Article 16 of the General Peace Treaty of 30 October 1980.

2. To determine the legal situation of the islands and maritime
spaces.”


“That because, for a long period of years, those waters belonged to
a single political entity, to wit, the Spanish Colonial Government in
Central America, and, later, to the Federal Republic of the Center of



America, the fact conclusively results that, on the dissolution of the
federation without having effected a delimitation among the three
riparian States of their sovereignty therein, the ownership of those
waters continued in common in those three States.” (AJIL, 1917,
p. 677.)

Nicaragua appeared in the proceedings and resisted the claim, contend-
ing (inter alia)

“que las antiguas provincias españolas de Nicaragua, Honduras y
El Salvador, por su adyacencia, son dueñas del Golfo, en el sentido de
que a cada una corresponde una parte de él; pero no en el sentido de que
por eso exista entre las referidas Republicas, una comunidad en la acep-
cion juridica de la palabra. Hay indemarcacion de fronteras, lo cual es
distinto de dominio comun” (CJC, Sentencia, p. 20),

i.e., that

“the ancient Spanish provinces of Nicaragua, Honduras and El Sal-
vador, by reason of the fact that they are adjacent, are owners of the
Gulf in the sense that to each belongs a part thereof, but not in the
sense that, thereby, a community in the legal acceptation of the word
exists among those republics. Demarcation of frontiers therein is
lacking; but this . . . does not result in common ownership.” (4JIL,
1917, p. 688.)

recognized by this Court to be that of a historic bay possessed of the
characteristics of a closed sea, the three riparian States of El Sal-
vador, Honduras and Nicaragua are, therefore, recognized as
coôwners of its waters, except as to the littoral marine league which is
the exclusive property of each, and with regard to the coôwnership
existing between the States here litigant, the Court . . . took into
account the fact that as to a portion of the non-littoral waters of the
Gulf there was an overlapping or confusion of jurisdiction in matters
pertaining to inspection for police and fiscal purposes and purposes
of national security, and that, as to another portion thereof, it is pos-
sible that no such overlapping and confusion takes place. The Court,
therefore, has decided that as between El Salvador and Nicaragua
coôwnership exists with respect to both portions, since they are both
within the Gulf; with the express proviso, however, that the rights
pertaining to Honduras as coparcener in those portions are not
affected by that decision.” (4JIL, 1917, p. 716.)

“Whilst Nicaragua does not at this stage intend to avail itself of the
provisions of Article 62 of the Statute of the Court, the purpose of the
present communication is to inform the Court that the possibility
offered by Article 62 is under active consideration. In this context I
am instructed to convey the view of my Government that Nicaragua
has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by a decision
of the Chamber constituted for the purpose of deciding the Case con-
cerning the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute between
El Salvador and Honduras. Moreover, in the light of the principle of
consent as invoked by the Court in the Monetary Gold case,
I.CJ. Reports 1954, p. 19, at p. 32, my Government considers it neces”
sary to reserve its position generally in relation to the Court’s Order
of 8 May 1987.”

Copies of this letter were transmitted to the two Parties by the Registrar of
the Court.

35. In its Application for permission to intervene, filed on 17 Novem-
ber 1989, Nicaragua stated that the Application was made by virtue of

(e) The general recognition by authoritative legal opinion that the
issues relating to the Gulf of Fonseca involve a trilateral con-
troversy.

(f) The leading role of coasts and coastal relationships in the legal
régime of maritime delimitation and the consequence in the
case of the Gulf of Fonseca that it would be impossible to carry
outa delimitation which took into account only the coasts in the
Gulf of two of the three riparian States.

(g) The fact that a possible element in the regulation of the legal
situation of maritime spaces, especially in a case like that of the
Gulf of Fonseca, would be the designation of one or more zones
of joint exploration and exploitation : see the Report of the Con-
ciliation Commission in the Jan Mayen Continental Shelf case,
International Law Reports (ed. E. Lauterpacht), Vol. 62, p. 108.”
(Application, para. 2.)


“now that Nicaragua is before the Chamber reiterating its petition to
intervene, it does so without submitting to the Chamber on this
opportunity the two questions that the full Court stated could only be
resolved after the decision on the Application for permission to inter-
vene was made by the Chamber... Nicaragua maintains, before this
Chamber of the Court, its Application for permission to intervene
but modified in the sense that the requests made in Sections 23 and 24
of its original Application of 17 November 1989 are not being sub-
mitted for decision by this Chamber”.

Inreplyto a question by the Chamber, the Agent made it clear that Nicara-
gua accepted that the decision on intervention is entirely for the Chamber,
which has full authority to decide on it and stated further:

“The Chamber is correct in understanding that Nicaragua accepts
that it is the Chamber which is properly seised of an application by
Nicaragua for permission to intervene before it in the case concern-
ing the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Hon-
duras); and that Nicaragua recognizes that the eventual decision of
the Chamber granting or refusing permission to intervene will be
binding and final...

The only limitation we have made to our original application to the

qualified as a ‘genuine intervention’. ..”

At the hearings, El Salvador urged rejection of the Nicaraguan Applica-
tion because acceptance of it “would wreak havoc on the Parties to this
case and would create an unconscionable situation of interference, rather
‘than one of orderly advancement of the proceedings”.

of Article 62 might impliedly authorize continuance of the proceedings in



the absence of a State whose “interests of a legal nature” might be
“affected”, this did not justify continuance of proceedings in the absence
of a State whose international responsibility would be “the very subject-
matter of the decision”. The Court did not need to decide what the posi-




vene can only be judged in concreto and in relation to all the circumstances
of a particular case. It is for the State seeking to intervene to identify the
interest of a legal nature which it considers may be affected by the decision
in the case, and to show in what way that interest may be affected; it is not
for the Court itself — or in the present case the Chamber — to substitute
itself for the State in that respect.

66. The Chamber concludes that, insofar as the dispute relates to sover-
eignty over the islands, it should not grant permission for intervention by
Nicaragua, in the absence of any Nicaraguan interest liable to be directly
affected by a decision on that issue. Any possible effects of the islands as
relevant circumstances for delimitation of maritime spaces fall to be con-
sidered in the context of the question whether Nicaragua should be per-
mitted to intervene on the basis of a legal interest which may be affected by
a decision on the legal situation of the waters of the Gulf. The Chamber
therefore turns to that question.

American Court is or is not opposable to Honduras. It is true that a deci-
sion of the Chamber rejecting El Salvador’s contentions, and finding that
there is no condominium in the waters of the Gulf which is opposable to
Honduras, would be tantamount to a finding that there is no condomi-
nium at all. Similarly, a finding that there is no such “community of inter-
ests” as is claimed by Honduras, between El Salvador and Honduras in
their capacity as riparian States of the Gulf, would be tantamount to a
finding that there is no such “community of interests” in the Gulf at all. In
either event, such a decision would therefore evidently affect an interest of
a legal nature of Nicaragua; but even so that interest would not be the
“very subject-matter of the decision” in the way that the interests of Alba-
nia were in the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in
1943. As explained above (paragraph 56), it follows from this that the
question whether the Chamber would have power to take a decision on
these questions, without the participation of Nicaragua in the proceed-
ings, does not arise; but that the conditions for an intervention by Nicara-
gua in this aspect of the case are nevertheless clearly fulfilled.

claim to intervene in relation to the legal régime of the maritime spaces
inside the Gulf, not to justify an intervention in relation to the legal situa-
tion of the maritime spaces outside.

Nor can the Chamber disregard in this connection the indication by the
Agent of Nicaragua, quoted in paragraph 86 above, that Nicaragua seeks
to protect its legal interest solely in such way as the Statute allows.


given to the Court in Article 62 of the Statute is not extendable to making

an intervener a party to the case unless the parties to the case have con-

sented to the change appears also to be the view of Nicaragua, which

stated during the oral proceedings that “Article 62 is a part of the inciden-

tal jurisdiction and there is no compelling logic requiring its provisions to

be seen as an ‘exception’ to the principle of consent”. There is furthermore




become party to the proceedings, and does not acquire the rights, or
become subject to the obligations, which attach to the status of a party,
under the Statute and Rules of Court, or the general principles of pro-
cedural law. Nicaragua, as an intervener, has of course a right to be
heard by the Chamber. That right is regulated by Article 85 of the Rules
of Court, which provides for submission of a written statement, and parti-
cipation in the hearings. Time-limits will be fixed for a written statement
by Nicaragua, and observations thereon by the Parties, in accordance
with Article 85, so soon after the delivery of the present Judgment as the
appropriate consultations can be held.

been justified. The Chamber therefore finds that Nicaragua should be
permitted to intervene but solely in respect of the Chamber's considera-
tion of the legal régime of the maritime spaces within the Gulf of Fonseca,
and to participate in the proceedings in the case in accordance with
Article 85 of the Rules of Court.
