        2. The Court interprets Nicaragua’s third submission “as seeking a specific finding regarding
the effect, if any, that the maritime entitlements of Serranilla [and] Bajo Nuevo . . . would have on
any maritime delimitation between the Parties” (Judgment, para. 97). Reiterating that a State’s
extended continental shelf cannot overlap with the area of continental shelf within 200 nautical miles
from the baselines of another State, the Court points out that there is “no area of overlapping
entitlement . . . to be delimited”, regardless of whether Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo are entitled to a
maritime zone of 200 nautical miles (Judgment, para. 99). On that basis, the Court “considers that it
does not need to determine the scope of the entitlements of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo in order to
settle the dispute submitted by Nicaragua in its Application” (Judgment, para. 100).

       3. It is true that, regardless of whether Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo generate a maritime zone of
200 nautical miles, their entitlements cannot, pursuant to the Court’s decisions on the first and the
second submissions, overlap with any possible entitlement to an extended continental shelf generated
by Nicaragua’s mainland coast. However, “the dispute submitted by Nicaragua in its Application” is
not limited to requesting a delimitation of overlapping entitlements.

       4. In its Application, Nicaragua requested the Court “to adjudge and declare . . . [t]he precise
course of the maritime boundary between Nicaragua and Colombia in the areas of the continental
shelf which appertain to each of them” 1. In its Memorial and its Reply, Nicaragua specified this
request, asking the Court to declare that “Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo are enclaved and granted a
territorial sea of twelve nautical miles” 2. Thus, by requesting the Court to determine the “precise
course of the maritime boundary”, Nicaragua asks about the effect, if any, that the maritime
entitlements of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo would have on the course of the relevant part of the
maritime boundary. However, the Court does not respond to this request and leaves the Parties in the
dark about the “precise course” of the maritime boundary. Contrary to its statement in paragraph 100
of the Judgment, the Court does not “settle the dispute submitted by Nicaragua in its Application”.

       5. The pleadings of the Parties confirm that the delimitation of overlapping entitlements does
not exhaust the subject-matter of the present dispute. Nicaragua specified that the dispute before the
Court encompassed the question of the scope of the entitlements of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo as far
as this was necessary for determining “the precise course of the boundary”3. Colombia did not contest
the Court’s jurisdiction to decide on this matter, nor did it argue that Nicaragua’s third submission
was inadmissible. Rather, Colombia engaged with Nicaragua’s arguments in substance and thereby
confirmed that the question of the entitlements of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo formed part of the
dispute before the Court 4. As the Court held in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v.

by the claims submitted to it by the parties” 5. At no point did the Parties take the position that their
dispute was restricted to the delimitation of overlapping entitlements. I do not doubt that the
determination whether there are overlapping entitlements is “[a]n essential step” and “the first step
in any maritime delimitation” (Judgment, para. 42). But I can see no reason  either procedural or
substantive  why this should preclude the Court from adjudicating a dispute concerning the
existence of an entitlement when it is necessary to do so to determine “the precise course” of a
maritime boundary.

      6. Nicaragua claims that it is entitled to an extended continental shelf in the area east of the
maritime zones generated by Colombia’s islands of San Andrés and Providencia and west of the
maritime zones generated by Colombia’s mainland coast 6. This claim would be well founded if, first,
Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo were merely entitled to a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles; second,
Nicaragua proved that a natural prolongation of its landmass exists in the area east of the
200-nautical-mile zones of San Andrés and Providencia; and, third, a State’s entitlement to an
extended continental shelf could pass through (“leapfrog over” or “tunnel under”) another State’s
200-nautical-mile entitlement. Had the Court upheld Nicaragua’s claim, the part of the maritime
boundary between the two States which is relevant for the third submission would start in the north
where the limit of the 200-nautical-mile zone generated by the Colombian islands of San Andrés and
Providencia meets the point where the rights of third States might be affected. From there, the
boundary would follow the limit of the 200-nautical-mile zones of San Andrés and Providencia to
the south, until it intersected the limit of the 200-nautical-mile zone generated by Colombia’s
mainland coast. It would then continue north-east along the 200-nautical-mile limit of Colombia’s
mainland coast until it again reached the point where the rights of third States might be affected.


       7. Colombia, in turn, maintains that Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo are each entitled to an EEZ
with its attendant continental shelf 7 and that any claim of Nicaragua to an extended continental shelf
within that area is excluded 8. Had the Court upheld Colombia’s claim, the maritime boundary
between the two Parties would start, in the north, where the limit of the 200-nautical-mile zone
generated by Nicaragua’s mainland coast meets the point where rights of third States might be
affected, and would run south until it intersected the starting-point of the boundary established by
the Court in its 2012 Judgment (see Judgment, p. 16, point A on sketch-map No. 2). It would then
follow that boundary until the endpoint (ibid., Point B on sketch-map No. 2), from where it would
continue south along the limit of the 200-nautical-mile zone generated by Nicaragua’s mainland
coast, to the point where the rights of third States might be affected.

        8. Ascertaining whether the three conditions mentioned in paragraph 6 above have been
fulfilled is thus a precondition for determining the precise course of the maritime boundary between
Nicaragua and Colombia. This is true even if Nicaragua were only able to prove that the natural
prolongation of its land territory covers just a part of the relevant area which it claims  assuming
that Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo are enclaved and that a State’s entitlement to an extended continental
shelf may pass through another State’s 200-nautical-mile entitlement. In that case, the maritime
boundary would still follow the 200-nautical-mile limit of the zones generated by the coasts of
San Andrés and Providencia.

       9. For these reasons, I do not think that the Court should have rejected Nicaragua’s third
submission at this stage of the proceedings. The Court should rather have given the Parties the
opportunity to present their case and to argue whether Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo generate a maritime
zone of 200 nautical miles, whether Nicaragua can prove that the natural prolongation of its coast
actually extends to the area around the territorial sea of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo (a question which
might have required the Court to seek the help of experts or assessors), and whether a State’s
entitlement to an extended continental shelf can pass through the 200-nautical-mile zone of another
State.

       10. In particular, the Court should have given the Parties the opportunity to present oral
arguments on the latter question. In their written pleadings, the Parties took opposing views on the
possibility of “tunnelling” under or “leapfrogging” over a 200-nautical-mile zone, here the
200-nautical-mile zones generated by San Andrés and Providencia 9. The Court could then have
clarified whether such “tunnelling” or “leapfrogging” is possible under customary international law.
This question was touched upon briefly by an ITLOS Special Chamber in a judgment rendered after
the hearings in the present case in December 2022 10. However, the judgment of the ITLOS Special
Chamber does not relieve this Court of its obligation to hear the Parties on the disputed questions.

       12. In conclusion, I think that “[o]nce the Court has been regularly seised, the Court must
exercise its powers” 12. Indeed, the Court “must not exceed the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the
Parties, but it must also exercise that jurisdiction to its full extent” 13. Otherwise, the Court is
adjudicating infra petita.

                               II. Nicaragua’s first and second submissions

       13. I doubt that UNCLOS can be interpreted as originally implying a rule according to which
the extended continental shelf of one State may not extend within the 200-nautical-mile zone of
another. I also doubt that such a rule was part of the original crystallization of the customary
international law régimes governing the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.
However, I have come to the conclusion that such a rule has subsequently emerged as a rule of
customary international law. This is why I find paragraph 77 of the present Judgment to be

particularly important. The fact that the Court, in its reasoning, has not described and evaluated the
relevant practice and the accompanying attitudes of States in more detail does not mean that its
Judgment rests on a mere assertion.
