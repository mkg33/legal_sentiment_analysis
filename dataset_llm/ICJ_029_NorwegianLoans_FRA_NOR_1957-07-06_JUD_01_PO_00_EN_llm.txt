speak of domestic jurisdiction.”

The treaty here referred to is the Second Hague Convention of
1907 respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the
recovery of contract debts. The French Government invokes it
principally against the first ground of the first Objection and as
such it does not fall for consideration here; but the passage
quoted from the Observations and Submissions purports to show
also that the second ground of the first Objection is not valid since
both Parties are signatories of the Second Hague Convention of
1907. This calls for but brief observations by the Court.

The purpose of the Convention in question is that indicated in its
title, that is to say ‘‘the Limitation of the Employment of Force for
the Recovery of Contract Debts”. The aim of this Convention is
not to introduce compulsory arbitration in the limited field to
which it relates. The only obligation imposed by the Convention
is that an intervening Power must not have recourse to force
before it has tried arbitration. The Court can find no reason why
the fact that the two Parties are signatories of the Second Hague
Convention of 1907 should deprive Norway of the right to invoke
the reservation in the French Declaration.

The French Government also referred to the Franco-Norwegian
Arbitration Convention of 1904 and to the General Act of Geneva



of September 26th, 1928, to which both France and Norway are
parties, as showing that the two Governments have agreed to
submit their disputes to arbitration or judicial settlement in cer-
tain circumstances which it is unnecessary here to relate.

These engagements were referred to in the Observations and
Submissions of the French Government on the Preliminary Objec-
tions and subsequently and more explicitly in the oral presentations
of the French Agent. Neither of these references, however, can be
regarded as sufficient to justify the view that the Application of
the French Government was, so far as the question of jurisdiction
is concerned, based upon the Convention or the General Act. If the
French Government had intended to proceed upon that basis it
would expressly have so stated.

As already shown, the Application of the French Government is
based clearly and precisely on the Norwegian and French Decla-
rations under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute. In these
circumstances the Court would not be justified in seeking a basis
for its jurisdiction different from that which the French Govern-
ment itself set out in its Application and by reference to which
the case has been presented by both Parties to the Court.

From one point of view it might be said that the second ground
of the first Objection, namely the ground based on the reservation
in the French Declaration, is merely subsidiary in character. It is
true that the first ground of the first Preliminary Objection relies
upon the proposition that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the
dispute falls to be dealt with under the municipal law of Norway.
But Norway has also relied upon the second ground of its first
Preliminary Objection. Norway requests the Court “to decline,
on grounds that it lacks jurisdiction, the function which the
French Government would have it assume”. It is clear that
this request is based on both grounds, the character of the dispute
and the French reservation. In the opinion of the Court, the
second ground cannot be regarded as subsidiary, in the sense that
Norway would invoke the French reservation only in the event
of the first ground of its Objection being held to be legally
unfounded. The Court’s competence is challenged on both grounds
and the Court is free to base its decision on the ground which in its
judgment is more direct and conclusive.

Not only did the Norwegian Government invoke the French
reservation, but it maintained this second ground of its first
Objection throughout and at no time did it abandon it.

The Submissions in the Counter-Memorial, maintained in the
Rejoinder, are formulated as follows:

“Having regard to the fact that the Norwegian Government
maintains Preliminary Objections Nos. 1, 3 and 4 raised in the
document submitted to the Court on April 20th, 1956, May it please



the Court to adjudge and declare that the claim submitted by the
Application of the French Government of July 6th, 1955, is not
admissible.”

Since the Preliminary Objections under the head “First Objec-
tion” relied upon both grounds—the character of the dispute and
the French reservation—it was not necessary, in order to maintain
the two grounds, to specify that both were involved. What has
just been said also applies to the Final Submissions of the Norwegian
Government.

In the course of his oral presentations Counsel for the Norwegian
Government stated:

“... the Court has jurisdiction only in so far as undertakings prior
to the origin of disputes have conferred upon it the power of
adjudicating on such disputes as might arise between France and
Norway.

What are these undertakings?

They are the undertakings resulting from the Declarations made
by the two Governments on the basis of Article 36, paragraph 2, of
the Statute of the Court.

That is the only basis on which the other Party can rely to show
that its Application falls within the limits of the jurisdictional
competence of the Court. In so far as the undertakings given by the
two Parties are in concordance—to the extent of their reciprocity—
it is clear that Norway is bound in relation to France. But she has
no other obligation toward France. The Court may therefore
adjudicate in this dispute only if it is included within these limits.”

From the reply of the French Agent to this argument it appears
that in his view the second ground of the first Objection was fully
maintained by Norway. Later, in his oral rejoinder, the Agent for
the Norwegian Government declared:

“We maintain our positions in their entirety both as regards the
merits and as regards the Preliminary Objections.”

The Court cannot infer from the attitude of the Parties that the
second ground of the first Objection was regarded by them as
unimportant and still less that it was abandoned by the Norwegian
Government. Abandonment cannot be presumed or inferred;
it must be declared expressly, as was done when Norway declared
its abandonment of its second Preliminary Objection.

The Court does not consider that it should examine whether
the French reservation is consistent with the undertaking of a legal
obligation and is compatible with Article 36, paragraph 6, of the
Statute which provides:



“In the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction,
the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.”

The validity of the reservation has not been questioned by the
Parties. It is clear that France fully maintains its Declaration,
including the reservation, and that Norwav relies upon the reser-
vation.

In consequence the Court has before it a provision which both
Parties to the dispute regard as constituting an expression of their
common will relating to the competence of the Court. The Court
does not therefore consider that it is called upon to enter into an
examination of the reservation in the light of considerations which
are not presented by the issues in the proceedings. The Court,
without prejudging the question, gives effect to the reservation
as it stands and as the Parties recognize it.

The Court considers that the Norwegian Government is entitled,
by virtue of the condition of reciprocity, to invoke the reservation
contained in the French Declaration of March 1st, 1949; that this
reservation excludes from the jurisdiction of the Court the dispute
which has been referred to it by the Application of the French
Government; that consequently the Court is without jurisdiction
to entertain the Application.

In view of the foregoing it is not necessary for the Court to
examine the first ground of the first Objection, or to deal with
Objections 3 and 4 presented by the Norwegian Government,
or with the Submissions of the Parties other than those upon which
it is adjudicating in accordance with the reasons stated above.

Judge MorRENO QUINTANA, after voting for the Judgment, made
the following declaration:

The reason why I consider that the Court is without juris-
diction in this case is different from that given in the judgment.
I base myself, not on the second ground of the first Objection
put forward by the Government of the Kingdom of Norway
but on the first ground of that Objection. State loans, as
being acts of sovereignty, are governed by municipal law.

Vice-President BADAWI and Judge Sir Hersch LAUTERPACHT,
availing themselves of the right conferred on them by Article 57
of the Statute, append to the Judgment of the Court statements of
their individual opinions.

Judges GUERRERO, BASDEVANT and READ, availing themselves
of the right conferred on them by Article 57 of the Statute, append
to the Judgment of the Court statements of their dissenting

opinions.
