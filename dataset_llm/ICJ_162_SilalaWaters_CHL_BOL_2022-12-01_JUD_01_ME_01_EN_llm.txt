      2. This outcome has been made possible by the Court’s recourse to and reliance on its
pronouncement in Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France) that it “is entitled to interpret the submissions
of the Parties, and in fact is bound to do so; this is one of the attributes of its judicial functions”
(Judgment, para. 43, referring to I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 262, para. 29). As is well known, the
approach adopted in that case was criticized by several Members of the Court who “vigorously
dissent[ed]” (joint dissenting opinion of Judges Onyeama, Dillard, Jiménez de Aréchaga and
Sir Humphrey Waldock, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 312, para. 1). They argued that the 1974 Judgment’s
“basic premise fail[ed] to correspond to and even change[d] the nature and scope of . . . formal
submissions as presented in the Application” (ibid., para. 3).

       3. I accept that the Court may be entitled to interpret the final submissions of a party, in
particular when their true meaning is not sufficiently clear. The Court is also entitled to seek
clarification from the party that has formulated them. However, the Court should avoid an
interpretation that is at odds with the ordinary meaning of the words and legal concepts used in the
final submissions. While counsel for a party may use various formulations to advance the interests
of a party, the decisive weight shall be put on the final submissions read out by the agent and
subsequently submitted to the Registry in written, duly signed form.
