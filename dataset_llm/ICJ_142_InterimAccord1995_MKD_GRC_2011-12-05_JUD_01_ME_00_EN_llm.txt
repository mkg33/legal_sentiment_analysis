                       Jurisdiction of the Court and admissibility of Application.
                       Scope of dispute — Article 21, paragraph 2, of Interim Accord, as a basis for
                    the Court’s jurisdiction.
                       Respondent’s first objection to jurisdiction — Contention that dispute is
                    excluded from the Court’s jurisdiction under Article 21, paragraph 2 — Article 21,
                    paragraph 2, excludes disputes regarding the difference over the definitive name —
                    Disputes regarding Respondent’s obligation under Article 11, paragraph 1, within
                    the Court’s jurisdiction — Objection cannot be upheld.
                       Respondent’s second objection to jurisdiction — Contention that dispute relates
                    to conduct attributable to NATO and its member States — Applicant seeks to
                    challenge Respondent’s conduct and not NATO’s decision — No need to determine
                    responsibility of NATO or of its member States — Monetary Gold principle not
                    relevant — Objection cannot be upheld.


                   645 	          application of interim accord (judgment)

                      Respondent’s first objection to admissibility of Application — Contention that
                   Judgment would be incapable of effective application — Applicant’s claims relate
                   to Respondent’s conduct — Judgment capable of being applied effectively by the
                   Parties — Objection cannot be upheld.
                      Respondent’s second objection to admissibility of Application — Contention
                   that the Court’s Judgment would interfere with ongoing diplomatic negotiations —
                   Settlement of disputes by the Court not incompatible with diplomatic negotia‑
                   tions — Objection cannot be upheld.
                      The Court has jurisdiction — Application is admissible.

                     Merits of the case.
                     Contention by Applicant that Respondent failed to comply with the obligation
                   under Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Interim Accord.
                     Meaning of first clause of Article 11, paragraph 1 — Parties did not intend to
                   exclude NATO from scope of that provision — Whether Respondent “objected” to
                   Applicant’s admission to NATO — Resolution of difference over the name was the
                   “decisive criterion” for Respondent to accept Applicant’s admission to NATO —
                   Respondent objected to Applicant’s admission to NATO.

                      Effect of second clause of Article 11, paragraph 1 — Ordinary meaning of
                   terms employed — Meaning of phrase “to the extent” — Meaning of phrase “to
                   be referred to . . . differently than in paragraph 2 of Security Council resolu‑
                   tion 817 (1993)” — Interim Accord did not require Applicant to use provisional
                   designation in its dealings with Respondent — No constraint on Applicant’s prac‑
                   tice of calling itself by its constitutional name — Interpretation supported by
                   object and purpose of Interim Accord — Subsequent practice of the Parties in
                   implementing Interim Accord — No objection allowed on basis that Applicant is to
                   refer to itself in an organization with its constitutional name — No need to address
                   travaux préparatoires or additional evidence regarding use of Applicant’s constitu‑
                   tional name — Respondent not entitled under second clause of Article 11, para‑
                   graph 1, to object to Applicant’s admission to NATO.


                      Contention of Respondent that any objection to Applicant’s membership of
                   NATO would be justified under Article 22 of Interim Accord — Respondent’s
                   interpretation of Article 22 — No requirement under the North Atlantic Treaty
                   compelling the Respondent to object to admission of Applicant to NATO —
                   Respondent’s attempt to rely on Article 22 unsuccessful.
                      Respondent failed to comply with its obligation under Article 11, paragraph 1.

                      Exceptio non adimpleti contractus — Response to a material breach of a
                   treaty — Countermeasures — Certain minimum conditions common to all three
                   arguments.
                      Respondent’s allegations that Applicant failed to comply with its obligations
                   under Interim Accord — No breach by Applicant of second clause of Article 11,
                   paragraph 1 — Alleged breach by Applicant of Article 5, paragraph 1 — Obli­

                   646 	           application of interim accord (judgment)

                   gation to negotiate in good faith — Respondent has not met its burden of
                   ­demonstrating that Applicant breached its obligation under Article 5, paragraph 1
                    — No breach by Applicant of Article 6, paragraph 2, prohibiting interference in Res­
                    pondent’s internal affairs — No breach by Applicant of Article 7, paragraph 1,
                    requiring Applicant to take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or pro‑
                    paganda by State‑controlled agencies — Alleged breach by Applicant of Article 7,
                    paragraph 2 — One instance in 2004 in which Applicant displayed a symbol pro‑
                    hibited by Article 7, paragraph 2 — No breach by Applicant of Article 7, para‑
                    graph 3, regarding procedure to be followed in cases where symbols constituting
                    part of one Party’s historic or cultural patrimony are being used by other Party.



                      Conclusions concerning additional justifications invoked by Respondent — Con‑
                   ditions asserted by Respondent as necessary for application of the exceptio not
                   satisfied — Unnecessary for the Court to determine whether that doctrine forms
                   part of contemporary international law — Response to material breach — Display
                   of symbol in 2004 cannot be regarded as material breach within meaning of Arti‑
                   cle 60 of 1969 Vienna Convention — Failure of Respondent to show that its con‑
                   duct in 2008 was a response to 2004 breach — Countermeasures — Breach of
                   Article 7, paragraph 2, by Applicant had ceased as of 2004 — Respondent’s objec‑
                   tion cannot be justified as a countermeasure — Additional justifications submitted
                   by Respondent fail.

                      Declaration that Respondent has violated its obligation to Applicant under Arti‑
                   cle 11, paragraph 1, of Interim Accord, constitutes appropriate satisfaction — Not
                   necessary to order Respondent to refrain from any future conduct that violates its
                   obligation under Article 11, paragraph 1.
