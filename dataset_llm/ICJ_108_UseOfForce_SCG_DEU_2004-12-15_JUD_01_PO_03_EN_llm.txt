1. The Court in its Judgment finds that the Observations of Serbia and
Montenegro have not had the legal effect of discontinuance of proceed-
ings under the Rules (para. 30). I agree. It is clear that the Applicant has
declined to “discontinue”, and that “discontinuance” as envisaged in the
Rules is dependent on the consent of the Parties.

2. The Court further observes that:

“Prior to the adoption of Article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of
Court, in a number of cases in which the application disclosed no
subsisting title of jurisdiction, but merely an invitation to the State
named as respondent to accept jurisdiction for the purposes of the
case, the Court removed the cases from the List by order. By Orders
of 2 June 1999, it removed from the List two cases brought by Serbia
and Montenegro concerning Legality of the Use of Force against
Spain and the United States of America, on the ground that the
Court ‘manifestly lack[ed] jurisdiction’ (I. C.J. Reports 1999, pp. 773
and 925).” (Judgment, para. 31.)

3. The Court then observes that “[t]he present case does not however
fall into either of these categories”. The Court thus appears to regard
these as a closed list of categories for the removal of cases from the List
(other than where discontinuance has occurred), and to suggest that no
removal from the List was open to the Court in the present case as the
facts do not fall within the existing two examples.

7. In a pertinent dictum the Court stated that it saw:

“no reason to allow the continuance of proceedings which it knows
are bound to be fruitless. While judicial settlement may provide a
path to international harmony in circumstances of conflict, it is none
the less true that the needless continuance of litigation is an obstacle
to such harmony.” (Nuclear Tests ( Australia v. France), Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 271, para. 58; Nuclear Tests (New Zea-
land v. France), Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 61.)

9. These were actions by the Court in the exercise of its inherent
powers. The precedents on removal from the List cited by the Court
— where from the outset no subsisting title of jurisdiction has been
disclosed, or where the Court manifestly lacked jurisdiction — do not
constitute two exclusive categories within which the Court has to fall if it
wishes to exercise its inherent powers in the absence of discontinuance.
There is nothing in the case law that so suggests. Indeed, it is hard to
know what might be the legal source of a right to remove cases from the
List provided only that this would be limited to these two examples.

10. The Court’s inherent jurisdiction derives from its judicial character
and the need for powers to regulate matters connected with the adminis-



tration of justice, not every aspect of which may have been foreseen in
the Rules. It was on such a basis that the Permanent Court had admitted
the filing of preliminary objections to jurisdiction even before this possi-
bility was regulated by the Rules of Court. The Court stated that it was
“at liberty to adopt the principle which it considers best calculated to
ensure the administration of justice” (Mavrommatis Palestine Conces-
sions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 2, p. 16). The power
of the Court to identify remedies for any breach of a treaty, in a case
where jurisdiction was based solely upon the treaty concerned, has been
regarded as within the Court’s inherent powers in the Corfu Channel case
(Assessment of Amount of Compensation, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1949,
p. 244) and in the LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America) case
(Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany, Vol. I, 16 Septem-
ber 1999, para. 3.60).

12. Thus the real question is not whether the Applicant has or has not
“discontinued” the case, nor whether the present circumstances are exactly
identical to the few examples where the Court itself has removed a case
from the List (examples which will, in their turn, have been “new” at the
relevant time and not falling into any previously established category).
The question is whether the circumstances are such that it is reasonable,
necessary and appropriate for the Court to strike the case off the List
as an exercise of inherent power to protect the integrity of the judicial
process.

15. Having thus put itself in a position incompatible with Article 38,
paragraph 2, of the Rules, Serbia and Montenegro did not inform the
Court it was discontinuing the case under Article 89 of the Rules, but
rather “asked the Court to decide on its jurisdiction”. It was in fact in no
position to make such a request of the Court, and these events alone are
sufficient, in my view, for the Court to have used its inherent powers to
ensure orderly conduct of its judicial function, and to have removed the
cases from the List.

“There are inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial func-
tion which the Court, as a court of justice, can never ignore. There
may thus be an incompatibility between the desires of an applicant,
or, indeed, of both parties to a case, on the one hand, and on the
other hand the duty of the Court to maintain its judicial character.
The Court itself, and not the parties, must be the guardian of the
Court’s judicial integrity.” (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1963, p. 29.)

18. In paragraph 38 of the Judgment, the Court states that it “cannot
decline to entertain a case simply because of a suggestion as to the
motives of one of the parties or because its judgment may have implica-
tions in another case”. Some observations in response to this statement
have been made in paragraph 12 of the joint declaration of seven judges.
In that context it is also necessary to make some observations on the
remarkable attention given by the Court to Article 35, paragraph 2, of
the Statute. This provision had, of course, never been invoked by the
Applicant during the period when it relied on its original grounds of
jurisdiction. The Applicant’s irregular request of 20 December 2002 to
the Court was “to decide on its jurisdiction considering the pleadings
formulated in these Written Observations”. These Written Observations
contained no invocation of Article 35, paragraph 2, as an alternative
ground of jurisdiction — yet, going beyond what the Applicant requested
in the present case, the Court has devoted some 23 paragraphs to laying
the grounds for a finding that Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute
could not have been an alternative basis for allowing access to the Court
in respect of the Genocide Convention so far as Serbia and Montenegro
is concerned. This exercise was clearly unnecessary for the present case.
Its relevance can lie, and only lie, in another pending case. I believe the
Court should not have entered at all upon this ground in the present case.

legal situation thereafter, it remains debatable whether “from the van-
tage point from which the Court now looks at the legal situation”, the
“new development in 2000 . . . has clarified the thus far amorphous legal
situation concerning the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
vis-à-vis the United Nations” at the relevant time (Judgment, para. 77).


“in harmony — though not, of course, in concert — and that each
should perform its functions with respect to a situation or dispute,
different aspects of which appear on the agenda of each, without
prejudicing the exercise of the other’s powers” (Questions of Inter-
pretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising
from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v.
United Kingdom), Provisional Measures, Order of 14 April 1992,
LC.J. Reports 1992, p. 27, separate opinion of Judge Lachs).

The Court, in purporting to find an ex post facto clarification of the
situation as it was in 1992-2000, notwithstanding that the General Assem-
bly and Security Council had in all deliberation felt the objectives of the
United Nations were best met by legal ambiguity, seems to have ignored
that wise dictum.
