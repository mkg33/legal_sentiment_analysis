                    1. I agree with a number of the Court’s findings. I should, however,
                 like to present here certain comments, and to explain why I do not agree
                 with some of the points in the Judgment. I will do so by taking each of
                 the joined cases in turn.


                      I. Case concerning Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in
                                 the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)


                    2. This first case, entitled case concerning Certain Activities Carried
                 Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), initially
                 related only to those activities, and Costa Rica’s pleadings were directed
                 exclusively to seeking a finding that Nicaragua had been in breach of
                 certain of its obligations, in particular by failing to respect Costa Rica’s
                 sovereignty over the northern part of Isla Portillos (see in particular para-
                 graphs 1 and 2 of the Application instituting proceedings). In its final
                 submissions, Costa Rica additionally asked the Court to find that it has
                 sovereignty over the disputed territory (paragraph 2 (a) of its final sub-
                 missions).
                    3. In its decision the Court found :
                 (a) that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the “disputed territory”, as
                       defined by the Court in paragraphs 69 and 70 of its Judgment ;
                 (b) that, by excavating three caños and establishing a military presence
                       on Costa Rica’s territory, Nicaragua had violated the latter’s
                       sovereignty.
                    4. I voted against the first of these findings and in favour of the second.
                 I believe that it would be helpful if I explained my reasons for those votes.
                 In order to do so, I will recall the applicable law and the local geographi-
                 cal situation, before explaining my reasoning.

                                              1. Applicable Law
                    5. Article II of the Treaty of Limits between Costa Rica and Nicara-
                 gua of 15 April 1858 provides that “[t]he dividing line between the two
                 Republics, starting from the Northern Sea, shall begin at the end of Punta
                 de Castilla, at the mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, and shall
                 run along the right bank of the said river up to a point three English miles
                 distant from Castillo Viejo”. Article IV provides that the Bay of San Juan
                 del Norte shall be “common to both Republics”. Article VI further pro-
                 vides that: “[t]he Republic of Nicaragua shall have exclusively the domin-
                 ion and sovereign jurisdiction over the waters of the San Juan River from
                 its origin in the Lake to its mouth in the Atlantic”.
                    6. Those provisions were interpreted as follows in point 1 of the third
                 paragraph of President Cleveland’s Award of 22 March 1888 :

                      “the boundary line between the Republics of Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
                      on the Atlantic side, begins at the extremity of Punta de Castilla at the
                      mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, as they both existed on the
                      15th day of April 1858. The ownership of any accretion to said Punta
                      de Castilla is to be governed by the laws applicable to that subject.”
                   7. Those texts were in turn interpreted by General Alexander, who, in
                 his first Arbitral Award of 30 September 1897, noted the following :
                      (a) “Costa Rica was to have as a boundary line the right . . . bank of
                          the river” ;
                      (b) “this division implied also, of course, the ownership by Nicaragua
                          of all islands in the river and of the left . . . bank and headland” ;
                          
                      (c) “there is but one starting‑point possible for such a line, and that
                          is at the right headland of the bay”, that is to say “the extremity
                          of Punta de Castill[a], at the mouth of the river”, as it was in 1858.
                  However, given that, between 1858 and 1897, the extremity of the head-
                 land had become covered by the sea, General Alexander took as the
                 ­starting‑point for the delimitation that same headland as it was at the
                  time of his Award. He accordingly decided as follows :
                      “the initial line of the boundary to run as follows :
                         Its direction shall be due northeast and southwest, across the bank
                      of sand, from the Caribbean Sea into the waters of Harbor Head
                      Lagoon. It shall pass, at its nearest point, 300 feet on the northwest
                      side from the small hut now standing in that vicinity. On reaching the
                      waters of Harbor Head Lagoon, the boundary line shall turn to the
                      left, or southeastward, and shall follow the water’s edge around the
                      harbor until it reaches the river proper by the first channel met. Up
                      this channel, and up the river proper, the line shall continue to ascend
                      as directed in the treaty.”

                                   2. The Current Geographical Situation
                    12. As to be expected, the geographical situation has radically changed
                 since 1897 as a result of erosion to the east of the delta and accretion to
                 the west.
                 (a) The headland of Punta de Castilla has been reduced still further, and
                      the initial marker placed there in 1897 is today under the sea.
                 (b) Harbor Head Lagoon has essentially retained its former shape.

                 (c) The Parties disagree regarding the sandbank which partially closed
                     the lagoon in 1897. Costa Rica claims that this feature still exists only

                      in its eastern part, and that its western part has disappeared. It further
                      contends that the channel referred to in the Alexander Awards has
                      also disappeared (CR 2015/14, p. 31). Nicaragua maintains that this
                      feature still exists and that it remains connected both to San Juan
                      Island and to Punta de Castilla (CR 2015/15, p. 24).

                 (d) The Island of San Juan has, it appears, been reduced in size, but is
                     still shown on the most recent maps.
                 (e) The main channel of the San Juan River has remained comparable
                     to what it was before (with some slight changes). It is, however, diffi-
                     cult to determine at the current time where its actual mouth lies.
                 (f) The Bay of San Juan del Norte is now completely silted up. It has
                     disappeared, as have the Port of Greytown and the lighthouse and
                     facilities constructed by Vanderbilt on San Juan Island.

                                        3. The Judgment of the Court
                    13. Nicaragua recalls that, according to General Alexander’s first
                 Arbitral Award, from the headland of Punta de Castilla the boundary
                 “shall follow the water’s edge around the harbor [at Harbor Head] until
                 it reaches the river proper by the first channel met”. It will then continue
                 “up this channel and up the river proper”. Nicaragua claims that today
                 the first channel met coming from the east is the caño which it dredged,
                 and that the boundary runs along that channel. It accordingly concludes
                 that the activities carried out by it on that caño and a little further north
                 were conducted on Nicaraguan territory and were lawful. Costa Rica
                 denies this.
                    14. The Court has concluded that “the right bank of the caño which
                 Nicaragua dredged in 2010 is not part of the boundary between Costa
                 Rica and Nicaragua” (Judgment, para. 92). I entirely agree with this, and
                 I accordingly consider, like the Court, that in dredging that caño and then
                 excavating two others, and in establishing a military presence in the area,
                 Nicaragua violated Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty.
                    15. On the other hand, in my view the Court was not entitled to rule
                 on the belated submissions by Costa Rica in which it asked the Court to
                 recognize its sovereignty over the disputed territory, since the latter was
                 not in a position to take such a decision in light of the material in the case
                 file.
                    16. Article 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute provides that the subject of
                 the dispute must be indicated in the application, and this is reiterated in
                 Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Rules. The Court has deemed those provi-
                 sions “essential from the point of view of legal security and the good
                 administration of justice” (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.
                 Democratic Republic of the Congo), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                 2010 (II), p. 656, para. 38, citing Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru

5 Ord 1088.indb 347                                                                                19/10/16 12:01

                   certain activities and construction of a road (decl. guillaume)                   837

                 1992, p. 267, para. 69). The subject of a dispute is thus defined by the
                 claims presented in the application. Additional claims are not admissible
                 unless they fall within the scope of that subject ; if not, they must be dis-
                 missed for lateness. The only exception to that rule is if the new claims
                 were implicit in the application, or arose directly out of the question
                 which is the subject‑matter of the application (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo,
                 op. cit., p. 657, para. 41, citing those two criteria as identified by the
                 Court in its preliminary objections Judgment in the case concerning Cer‑
                 tain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), op. cit., p. 266,
                 para. 67). However, in the present case, the Application concerned certain
                 activities carried out by Nicaragua in the border area, and its subject was
                 not the delimitation of the Parties’ territory. Moreover, Costa Rica’s new
                 claims were not implicit in the Application ; nor did they arise directly out
                 of the question that was the latter’s subject‑matter. They transformed a
                 dispute over State responsibility into a territorial dispute.

                   17. Furthermore, it makes no difference that Nicaragua did not object
                 to Costa Rica’s new submissions, and that one of its counsel even admit-
                 ted that both Parties were asking the Court to rule on the course of the
                 boundary and the resultant territorial sovereignty (CR 2015/15, p. 58). In
                 so doing, Nicaragua did indeed accept the Court’s jurisdiction to rule on
                 Costa Rica’s new submissions. But jurisdiction must not be confused with
                 admissibility. Even if those new submissions fell within the Court’s juris-
                 diction under the forum prorogatum principle, they still had to comply
                 with the procedural rules set out in the Statute and the Rules of Court. It
                 was for the Court to ask itself proprio motu whether Costa Rica’s new
                 submissions were admissible 1.

                 “the northern part of Isla Portillos . . . between the right bank of the dis-
                 puted caño, the right bank of the San Juan River up to its mouth at the
                 Caribbean Sea and the Harbor Head Lagoon” (Judgment, para. 69).
                 Thus, the Court agreed with the Parties in its recognition of Nicaragua’s
                 sovereignty over the lagoon and over the sandbank marking the latter’s
                 margin. The Court further found that Costa Rica had sovereignty over
                 the disputed territory. However, it also noted that the Parties had
                 expressed differing views on the location of the mouth of the San Juan
                 River where it flows into the Caribbean Sea, and did not address the
                 question of its precise location. It accordingly decided to refrain from rul-
                 ing on that point (ibid., para. 70). It adopted the same reasoning for the

                    1 See to this effect, R. Kolb, La Cour internationale de Justice, Paris, Pedone, 2013,

                 p. 256.

                 stretch of the Caribbean coast lying between Harbor Head Lagoon and
                 the mouth of the San Juan (Judgment, para. 70).
                    19. I can understand the Court’s scruples on these two latter points.
                 The case file is silent on the first, and incomplete on the second. I note in
                 particular that Professor Thorne, Costa Rica’s expert, does not address
                 this second question in his report. On the other hand, Professor Kondolf,
                 Nicaragua’s expert, states that “[t]he lagoon appears to have a hydrologic
                 connection to Greytown Harbor to the west, via a channel behind the
                 barrier spit” (App. 1, Sec. 2.7, of Nicaragua’s Counter‑Memorial, Vol. I).
                 Furthermore, that channel appears on some of the recent photos. Finally,
                 it is shown on the most reliable of the maps produced by Costa Rica. I

                 nonetheless remains understandable.

                    20. The Court thus took it upon itself to define the disputed territory,
                 and then to decide which State had sovereignty over that territory, with-
                 out completely fixing its boundaries. However, according to the Court’s
                 jurisprudence, “‘to define’ a territory is to define its frontiers” (Territorial
                 Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994,
                 p. 26, para. 52). In acting as it did, the Court ignored that principle, just
                 as it ignored its jurisprudence on the admissibility of new claims. It would
                 have sufficed in this case to find that Nicaragua’s activities had taken
                 place on Costa Rican territory, without ruling on these additional claims.
                 
                    21. I also agreed with the Judgment’s finding that, “by excavating two

                   22. Point 4 of the operative clause concerns certain incidents cited by
                 Costa Rica. It calls for certain additional comments on my part. The two
                 incidents mentioned in paragraph 135 of the Judgment undoubtedly
                 involved a violation by Nicaragua of Costa Rica’s rights of navigation
                 under the 1858 Treaty, as interpreted by the Court in favour of inhabit-
                 ants of the right bank of the river. On the other hand, the three other
                 instances mentioned by Costa Rica, and not accepted by the Court, did
                 not involve such a violation (Judgment, para. 136). The first of them con-
                 cerns a teacher who was allegedly prevented from reaching his school by
                 boat in the absence of a letter of authorization from Nicaragua. However,
                 the only evidence was from press articles, and the incident was not proved.
                 The same applies to another incident involving two Costa Rican resi-
                 dents, who, according to a statement by a Costa Rican police officer who
                 received the complaint, were made to pay a departure tax at a Nicara-

                 guan army post. The last incident concerned journalists who were not
                 allowed to travel to Isla Portillos. However, they were not engaged in
                 commerce on the San Juan, nor were they inhabitants of the river’s right
                 bank ; thus their travel was not covered by the provisions of the
                 1858 Treaty as interpreted by the Court. In sum, the two proven incidents
                 are clearly regrettable, but one is bound to note that these were two iso-
                 lated incidents over a period of five years, from which no general conclu-
                 sions can be drawn regarding the overall conduct of the Nicaraguan
                 authorities.

                    23. Costa Rica further complained of the manner in which Nicaragua
                 was carrying out dredging works on the San Juan River. The Court
                 rejected Costa Rica’s submissions for reasons with which I am entirely in
                 agreement. In particular, it took the view that, in the absence of any
                 transboundary harm as a result of the dredging programme, it was unnec-
                 essary for it to determine the responsibility régime applicable in the mat-
                 ter (Judgment, para. 119). The Court thus refrained from deciding
                 whether or not the rules governing responsibility for this type of harm
                 under the 1858 Treaty had been modified as a result of developments in
                 international customary law.
                    24. In this regard I would recall that, according to point 6 of the third
                 paragraph of President Cleveland’s Arbitral Award of 22 March 1888 :

                         “The Republic of Costa Rica cannot prevent the Republic of Nic-
                      aragua from executing at her own expense and within her own terri-
                      tory such works of improvement, provided such works of improvement
                      do not result in the occupation or flooding or damage of Costa Rica
                      territory, or in the destruction or serious impairment of the navigation
                      of the said River or any of its branches at any point where Costa Rica
                      is entitled to navigate the same. The Republic of Costa Rica has the
                      right to demand indemnification for any places belonging to her on
                      the right bank of the River San Juan which may be occupied without
                      her consent, and for any lands on the same bank which may be
                      flooded or damaged in any other way in consequence of works of
                      improvement.”
                    25. It is clear from this passage that, to quote what the Court said in
                 its Judgment of 13 July 2009 :
                      “Nicaragua may execute [at its own expense] such works of improve-
                      ment [of navigation] as it deems suitable, provided that such works
                      do not seriously impair navigation on tributaries of the San Juan
                      belonging to Costa Rica” (Dispute regarding Navigational and Related
                      Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009,
                      p. 269, para. 155).
                   26. Furthermore, according to the Cleveland Award, works of
                 improvement conducted for purposes of navigation on the San Juan must
