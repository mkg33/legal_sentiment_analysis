Subject-matter of the dispute — Tripartite determination by Applicant,
Respondent and the Court — Different role of each “actor” — Inviolability of
Applicant's status — Applicant’s right to have the Court rule on the subject of
the dispute referred to it by the Applicant and on that alone — The Court can-
not substitute another subject of the dispute for the one submitted by the Appli-
cant — That would amount to deciding a quite different case.

Validity of the Canadian reservation — Sovereign, undisputed power of a
State to maintain or amend, whether by restricting or by extending it, a declara-
tion of acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction, or to withdraw it altogether when-
ever it wishes — Power to attach any reservation — Such freedom nonetheless
conditional on compliance with the Statute and the Rules of Court, the Charter
of the United Nations, and more generally, with international law and “ordre
public international” — Rights and obligations of the declarant State with
regard to the clause “system”, to those currently or potentially participating in
it and to the ultimate addressee of the clause, the International Court — Declar-
ant State free to withdraw from the “system” but not to compromise its exist-
ence or functioning and yet remain within it.

Definition of “conservation and management measures” — A new concept —
Pressing need for the international community to clarify, rationalize and har-
monize conservation and management measures — Need for co-operation —
Definition of such measures in light of international law — Their compatibility
with international law a sine qua non — Elements of the international definition
of such measures — Technical and scientific aspects — Legal elements — Issue
of legality — Legality as a built-in element of the definition — International law
cannot supply a definition which is confined to technical aspects and which, if
taken literally, would apparently authorize the violation of the most firmly
established principle of international law, freedom of the high seas.

2. On two occasions, however, in 1970 and 1994, Canada made reser-
vations imposing specific restrictions on the Court’s jurisdiction. In 1970
it amended its declaration of acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction so as



to enable it to take measures to prevent pollution and protect the marine
environment of its northern coast, over an area extending more than
100 miles towards the polar zone. At that time, however, the United States,
at which these measures were aimed, did not bring the matter before
the Court.

3. Canada’s reservation, contained in its declaration of 7 April 1970
(see I C.J. Yearbook 1975-1976, p. 54), had a certain resemblance, at
least as regards the manner in which it was formulated, to that of 1994
and read as follows:

“(2) Ideclare that the Government of Canada accepts as compul-
sory . . . the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice . . .
over all disputes . . . other than:

(d) disputes arising out of or concerning jurisdiction or rights
claimed or exercised by Canada in respect of the conservation,
management or exploitation of the living resources of the sea, or
in respect of the prevention or control or contamination of the
marine environment in marine areas adjacent to the coast of
Canada.” (Emphasis added.)

4. Disregarding the 1985 declaration, which contained no equivalent
reservation, it will be noted that the 1970 reservation quoted above has
been replaced by another, situated in the same place, allowing Canada to
exclude the jurisdiction of the Court in regard to

“Q) ...

(d) disputes arising out of or concerning conservation and manage-
ment measures taken by Canada with respect to vessels fishing
in the NAFO Regulatory Area, as defined in the Convention on
Future Multilateral Co-operation in the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries, 1978, and the enforcement of such measures.”
(Emphasis added.)

5. These similar reservations formulated by Canada on two separate
occasions would appear to reflect its hesitation, or reluctance, to submit
to the sanction of the International Court issues which it regarded as
vital, and in relation to which it considered the applicable law to be, in
the words of the Canadian Foreign Minister, “inadequate, non-existent
or irrelevant”. The point was that Canada was not entirely satisfied with
the Montego Bay Convention of 10 December 1982 on the Law of the
Sea, which for this reason it has not ratified and which, in its view, failed
to settle fully the problem of overfishing, thus jeopardizing fisheries
resources for future generations.

6. Canada has frequently expressed its dissatisfaction and invoked the
“emergency”, or even “state of necessity”, which it is facing in this
regard. Its declarations in international fora have been as clear as they
have been numerous. One writer has described one of them in the follow-
ing terms:

“The (Canadian) Minister of Fisheries, Mr. John Crosbie, had
told the Rio de Janeiro Conference that foreign overfishing was one
of the subjects which Canada intended to address as a matter of
urgency and that it had a dual aim in this regard: to obtain approval
from the world leaders meeting at the Earth Summit for certain prin-
ciples and measures on the one hand, and to seek a follow-up con-
ference to examine these questions in greater detail on the other
hand . . . Mr. Crosbie stated in barely veiled terms that legislative
action by the Canadian Federal Government with regard to fishing
on the high seas was being considered as a real alternative in response
to the urgent appeals that he had been getting from the Atlantic
Provinces, and in particular from Newfoundland, asking him to deal
with the problem of foreign overfishing on the ‘Nose’ and ‘Tail’ of
the Grand Banks by unilaterally extending his fisheries jurisdiction
beyond the 200-mile limit.” !

7. Statements of this type give us an insight into the real background
to the present case. The Court had to rule on its jurisdiction by examin-
ing the meaning and scope of Canada’s reservation, but it could not
ignore the fact that, if it accepted such a reservation, it was leaving the
author of that reservation free to combat foreign overfishing by unilater-
ally giving itself powers over the high seas for as long as no settlement
had been reached between itself and the States concerned. This account
of the background to the case was necessary, inasmuch as, where reser-
vations have been formulated ratione materiae, prima facie they cannot
be construed without at least some reference to the substantive issues
involved.

8. The case would have been perfectly simple if the duty of the Court
had been to confine itself to ascertaining the meaning of the expression
“conservation and management measures” contained in the reservation,
and to affirming that “the enforcement of those measures” against the
Spanish fishing vessel Estai was precisely covered by the terms of that
reservation, thus preventing the Court from entertaining any claim in this
regard. It is absolutely essential, however, that attention be focused on
another, far more important term of the reservation, that which places
Canada’s action, in geographical terms, “in the NAFO Regulatory Area”,
that is to say outside the 200-mile limit. And indeed the Estai was

boarded some 245 miles off the Canadian coast. If in the Canadian res-
ervation we simply substitute for the words “in the NAFO Regulatory
Area” the expression “beyond Canada’s 200-mile exclusive economic
zone”, then it immediately becomes clear that the Court is dealing here
with a reservation of an unusual, not to say audacious, nature. Hence it
became incumbent upon the Court to verify whether such a reservation
could be accepted without difficulty under the optional clause system.
9. Article I (2) of the NAFO Convention contains a crystal-clear defi-
nition which leaves no doubt in this regard when it provides that:

“The area referred to in this Convention as ‘the Regulatory Area’
is that part of the Convention Area which lies beyond the areas in
which coastal States exercise fisheries jurisdiction.” (Emphasis
added.)

It is in no sense a distortion of the Canadian reservation to recast it in
terms of its true meaning, making it accessible to the reader, who may
not be aware of the precise significance of the expression “NAFO Regu-
latory Area” and will certainly be in a better position to understand the
object of the reservation, whose field of application is “the high seas”.
The object of the reservation is to signal urbi et orbi that Canada claims
special jurisdiction over the high seas. The Court cannot interpret or
accept this reservation in the same way as it would interpret or accept an
ordinary reservation, since, without any need for a consideration of the
merits, its terms prima facie disclose a violation of a basic principle of
international law. This is an issue which the Court cannot simply ignore
by restricting itself to an external and superficial interpretation of the res-
ervation. It cannot be right for the Court to content itself in this case with
a purely formal view of the reservation, disregarding its material con-
tent — a content which does not require an investigation involving
examination of the merits, since it is abundantly clear that the reservation
affects a traditionally established right. This is the real flavour of this
fascinating case.

10. Without going further into the merits than is permissible at this
jurisdictional stage, the Court is bound to take account of the efforts by
Canada over more than a decade to obtain recognition, in the context of
its “preferential right” as a coastal State, of its special jurisdiction to act
on the high seas by means of measures for the conservation and manage-
ment of fisheries stocks in the interests of the entire international com-
munity. But, however estimable this aim, it would be over-facile to hold
that we must “answer a simple question: were the measures taken by
Canada and enforced against the Spanish vessel Estai, conservation and
management measures? If the answer is yes, the Court is without juris-
diction” (CR 98/14, p. 51, para. 10). It is over-simplifying the question to
empty the reservation of its sole veritable substance, for which Canada
has been campaigning for so many years, namely the purported prefer-
ential right of coastal States to take conservation and management meas-


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 520

ures in respect of the high seas?. The precise scope of the Canadian
reservation, and hence the question whether or not the Court’s jurisdic-
tion is excluded, thus depends basically on the issue of the meaning of the
“conservation and management measures” contemplated by that reserva-
tion. Depending on whether such measures fall to be interpreted by ref-
erence to Canadian law — or even simply by reference to the generally
accepted meaning of that expression — or on the contrary on the basis of
international law, given already that there is nothing to prevent them
being applied on the high seas, impugning the traditional principle of the
freedom of that area, the Canadian reservation takes on quite different
aspects. At this stage it is already clear that the Court cannot just content
itself with stating that the boarding on the high seas of a foreign fishing
vessel merely represents the enforcement of conservation and manage-
ment measures taken by Canada, and thus hold that that incident is cov-
ered by a reservation entirely depriving it of jurisdiction, for this would
be to shelter behind the notion of “conservation and management meas-
ures”, interpreted in an artificial manner, without any concern for what
such measures involve in terms of the violation of a well-established prin-
ciple of international law.

11. It follows that the only proper attitude is to interpret and evaluate
those “conservation and management measures” by reference to interna-
tional law. It is in the corpus of the law of nations that a definition of
such measures must be sought. And two options, and two only, accord-
ingly present themselves to the Court at this stage of the proceedings:
either, at the very least, to state that it cannot readily find any well-
established international definition of such measures applicable to the case
before it, and is accordingly obliged to touch on the merits of the case by
going further in its examination of the facts and of their implications in

preliminary character within the meaning of Article 79, paragraph 7, of
the Rules of Court; or, on the contrary, to declare that it does have avail-
able to it an undisputed international definition of conservation and
management measures, which, applied to the facts of this case, obliges it
to interpret the Canadian reservation as invalid or not opposable in so
far as it purports to cover acts occurring on the high seas, and is accord-
ingly not capable of constituting a bar to the Court’s jurisdiction to pro-
ceed to an examination of the merits.

12. Without dealing with all the points which appear to me disputable
in the Judgment — in particular the theoretical and practical implications
of the methods of interpretation adopted therein, or at least the manner
in which the Judgment formulates a number of these points (see in par-

ticular paragraphs 46 to 54 of the Judgment) — I shall restrict myself to
raising three important questions on which, to my great regret, I find
myself obliged to express my disagreement with the majority of the Court:

— the subject-matter of the dispute;
— the validity of the Canadian reservation;
— the definition of conservation and management measures.

*
* *

II. THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE DISPUTE

13. What makes this case so unique and at the same time gives it its
great legal interest, is the persistent disagreement between the applicant
State and the respondent State with regard to the actual subject-matter of
the dispute — a disagreement now extended by another, just as far-
reaching, between the majority of the Court and the minority on the
same point. This is hardly an everyday occurrence in the Court’s juris-
prudence.

14. Determination of the subject-matter of the dispute appears to me
to be a “tripartite operation”, involving first the applicant State, then the
respondent State and finally the Court. But I would hasten to add that in
this operation the distribution of roles among the various actors is
necessarily unequal or, more precisely, different, since the principle of
equality has no part to play here. In a case before the International
Court the allocation of tasks is necessarily dependent upon the status of
each of the actors. And to accord to each of them an equal say in the
determination of the subject of the dispute is to call into question the
intrinsic status of Spain as Applicant, the equally specific status of Canada
as Respondent, and finally the status of the Court as forum rather than
party.

15. For it stands to reason that within any judicial order, whether
domestic or international, it is naturally the applicant who has the initia-
tive and who defines — at his own judicial risk — the subject-matter of
the dispute which he wishes to bring before the court. In this regard he
enjoys a clear procedural right, deriving from his status as applicant, to
seek and to obtain from the court a ruling on the subject of the dispute
which he has submitted to it and on that alone, to the exclusion of all
others (subject of course to any supervening incidental proceeding). The
principle of the equality of the parties is by its nature completely irrele-
vant to this question, for it cannot render “equal” those who, procedur-
ally, are “different”. It cannot turn the “respondent” into a “second
applicant”, purportedly endowed with some concurrent power to reformu-
late the subject-matter of the dispute as defined by the applicant. Nor, by
the same token, can it transform the court into an applicant “party” (a
third one!), with the power to set aside the subject of the dispute as
defined in the application and replace it with an entirely different one.


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 522

16. In international proceedings, as indeed in domestic litigation, the
respondent State, by virtue of its very status as respondent, does not have
a power to intervene in the definition of the subject as presented by the
applicant. It could only have such a right if it changed its status, which
can happen in two cases: first, where the proceedings are instituted not as
in this case by an application, but by means of a special agreement, thus
making each State simultaneously applicant and respondent, and
secondly where, in proceedings instituted by an application as in this
case, the respondent State lodges a counter-claim, of which there is no
question here.

*
* *

17. What then happened in this case?

I shall do my best to avoid compounding the semantic confusion which
has rendered still more complex a problem thought to be simple, and
I shall in particular endeavour to avoid using the word “claims”, which
in my view has a somewhat narrow scope, giving my preference to what
I consider to be the more appropriate term here, namely the “dispute”,
which has a wider sense. Thus it appears to me that the word “claims”
denotes legal acts whereby one party to the proceedings makes “requests”,
which it seeks to have upheld by the court by means of arguments of fact
or law (the “grounds”), presented by it in support of those requests in
order to enable the court to settle the “dispute”.

18. How, as Applicant, did the complainant here indicate to the Court
what it was complaining about? Spain clearly stated the precise matter
over which it was bringing Canada before the Court. In both its written
and its oral pleadings, it consistently complained of “a very serious
infringement of a right deriving from its sovereign status, namely exclu-
sive jurisdiction over vessels flying its flag on the high seas” (CR 98/9,
p. 20), and stated that the subject of the dispute, which constituted “the
crux of the case”, was the issue of Canada’s legal title to act on the high
seas against vessels flying the flag of a foreign State. And in its final sub-
missions Spain again emphasized that “the subject-matter of the dispute
is Canada’s lack of title to act on the high seas against vessels flying the
Spanish flag, the fact that Canadian fisheries legislation cannot be invoked
against Spain, and reparation for the wrongful acts perpetrated against
Spanish vessels” (emphasis added).

19. In setting out in clear and precise terms the subject of its dispute,
both from the outset in its Application, and then in its Memorial, oral
argument and final submissions, Spain had satisfied the requirements of
the Statute and the Rules of Court. Thus at no time was there any sug-
gestion by the Court that Spain had failed to comply with the require-
ments of Article 40 of the Statute or of Article 38, paragraph 1, of the
Rules of Court, both of which obliged it to state the precise nature of
“the subject of the dispute” from the outset, when it filed its Application.


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 523

20. It should be noted in passing that this same dispute also involved
not just Spain, but the entire European Community. And it is not with-
out relevance to observe that Spain, whose concern was matched by that
of the other member States, both of the European Community and of
NAFO, had already raised the same subject of dispute, and consistently
posed the same problem in the same terms, by protesting vigorously
against the Canadian legislation, even before the filing of its Application
with the Court some ten months later following the boarding of the Estai
and the harassment and inspection of other Spanish vessels. Spain could
not have demonstrated greater consistency. The same dispute was already
in existence even before the incident. The conflict between Spain and
Canada over the alleged entitlement to a “right” over the high seas was
already in existence and had indeed become quite serious, before it dra-
matically came to a head ten months later as a result of the effective exer-
cise of such a “right” against a Spanish vessel. Canada’s purported
“right” to act on the high seas under certain conditions laid down in its
new legislation remained the same. It had finally provided Spain with the
opportunity to bring it before the Court. That was the subject of the dis-
pute, declared and indeed reiterated with rare perseverance by Spain.

21. In sum, in this case, for Spain acting in its capacity as Applicant,
the subject of the dispute was clearly constituted by the issue of the legal
title to act on the high seas, in the light of the principles and rules of
international law which uphold the freedom of the seas (“grounds” of
law) and which Spain claims to have been violated by Canada (“argu-
ments” of fact), as a result of which Spain has asked the Court to declare
the Canadian legislation unopposable to it and to order that Canada
refrain from any repetition of the acts complained of and make appro-
priate reparation for those acts (“claims” and “requests”).

*
* *

22. Tt was an altogether different subject-matter that Canada — not-
withstanding its status as respondent State — raised against Spain. It
invoked issues of fishing and of the conservation and management of
fisheries resources within the NAFO Regulatory Area, and consequently
contended that this was the true subject of the dispute, and that it was
excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court by virtue of reservation (d)
inserted by Canada in its new declaration notified on 10 May 1994 (two
days before the adoption of Bill C-29 amending the Coastal Fisheries
Protection Act). It is worth noting that the definition of the subject of the
dispute given by Canada in this case was not “objectively” substantiated
in submissions on the merits. Spain, on the other hand, did present
submissions on the merits in its Application. Canada’s definition may
therefore appear to have been “tailored to suit the occasion”, inasmuch
as it was intended to support the Canadian position concerning jurisdic-
tion.


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 524

Thus Canada stated that

“this case arose out of and concerns conservation and management
measures taken by Canada with respect to Spanish vessels fishing in
the NAFO Regulatory Area and the enforcement of such measures”
(Counter-Memorial of Canada, para. 229).

% * *

23. We are faced here with two entirely different subjects of the dis-
pute: one put forward in Spain’s Application, and the only one which —
because it emanated from the Applicant — the Court was required to
settle (having, of course, first “processed” it, i.e., given the dispute its
“legal characterization”); the other submitted by Canada, which the
Court could not have entertained unless Canada had itself lodged a
counter-claim. This was not the case. The Court should therefore, at
most, have focused the proceedings on the true subject of the dispute,
as presented and defined by the applicant State, while asking Canada to
concentrate its defence on this subject and no other, although at the same
time allowing Canada to submit, as one of its “grounds” of law, what it
had presented as a “subject of the dispute”. In this way, the Court could
have “adjusted the focus” of the proceedings while remaining on firm legal
ground. None of this occurred, despite the desperate attempts by Spain,
which simply reiterated its contention that the dispute was confined to
events on the high seas and that the other, prior, matters did not relate
to the dispute stricto sensu and did not in any case concern Spain, which,
in its capacity as Applicant, was free to refer to the Court the dispute
of its choosing, albeit, obviously, at its own judicial risk.

24. There is of course a connection between the subject-matter of the
dispute, as defined by the Applicant for the purposes of the claim which
it instituted, but which regrettably was not heard, and that alleged by the
Respondent to be the true one, which the Court did indeed settle and dis-
pose of. However, that connection in no way justified the substitution by
the Court of the second subject for the first one as defined by the Appli-
cant.

25. And even allowing, on an extreme view, that the Canadian legisla-
tion, together with its implementing regulations, had given rise to a gen-
eral dispute, and that, on that basis, such a general dispute could be
regarded as comprising a number of aspects or involving a number of
levels, this was still no justification for refusing, as the Court did, to rec-
ognize an applicant State’s right to refer to it only one aspect of that gen-
eral dispute, despite its connection with other aspects. As the Court was
at pains to point out in the case of the United States Diplomatic and Con-
sular Staff in Tehran, “no provisions of the Statute or Rules contem-
plates that the Court should decline to take cognizance of one aspect of a
dispute merely because that dispute had other aspects”.


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 525

26. Notwithstanding all of this, the Court took the view that the
proper course in law was to relocate the subject of the dispute so as to
bring it far closer to that proposed by Canada. In my view the Judgment
conferred upon the respondent State and the Court powers so wide as to
distort the essential nature of the subject of the dispute as set out in the
Application. Determination of the subject-matter of the dispute is admit-
tedly, as I have already said, a “tripartite” or triangular operation,
involving, in various degrees and with different roles and powers, first the
Applicant, then the Respondent, and finally the Court. The applicant
State is free to submit such dispute as it wishes to submit, but has a duty
under the Statute to “specify” and “define” the subject-matter of that dis-
pute. The scene is set. The play to be acted out has been freely chosen by
the Applicant. The proceedings have been initiated, on the terms desired
by the Applicant. The respondent State now has the option of casting its
legal “grounds”, whatever they be, in the mould thus prepared for them.
It is, however, well accepted that the Respondent may in practice opt for
an alternative judicial strategy and may seek to escape the definition of
the dispute given by the applicant State by invoking grounds and argu-
ments, which it is for the Court to evaluate. But the Court can in no way
modify the “decor” or change the subject-matter of the dispute. For, if it
did so, it would be rendering judgment in a case altogether different from
that brought before it by the Applicant. The Court’s role is to give an
appropriate legal characterization to those claims of the applicant State
which properly come within the framework of the subject-matter of the
dispute as that State has defined it in its Application. This does not mean
that the Court has the power to alter the subject-matter put before it. Still
less can the respondent State propose a different subject-matter to the
Court. That would be to hear a different case.

x * +

27. 1 find it regrettable that the Court allowed such a metamorphosis
to occur. The Respondent argued that the only possible subject-matter of
the dispute was “the conservation and management measures” taken by
it, in respect of whose enforcement it had been at pains to protect itself
through its reservation. And the Court accepted this, allowing the real
dispute submitted to it by the applicant State, which concerned its exclu-
sive and sovereign jurisdiction on the high seas over vessels flying its flag,
to be subsumed — in desolating fashion for the Applicant — in a non-
existent dispute about fisheries conservation and management. Thus,
while Spain proclaims its sovereignty on the high seas over its vessels,
Canada speaks of conservation and management measures. Whereas
Spain invokes a “conflict of jurisdiction” on the high seas, Canada
opposes to it a “conflict over fisheries conservation and management”.

28. There is a suggestive parallel to be drawn between these two situa-
tions. Spain asked the Court to settle a dispute which had arisen between
itself and Canada in 1995 concerning the legality and opposability to


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 526

Spain of a Canadian internal enactment which, when implemented on the
high seas, affected vessels flying its flag. The Court, won over by Cana-
da’s claim to alter the clear subject of the dispute, proceeded to settle a
dispute — one which moreover no longer exists, having arisen in 1994
between Canada and the European Community. In place of the dispute
properly submitted to it by the applicant State, which concerned respect
for the international limits of national jurisdiction, the Court proceeded,
in quite surprising fashion, to direct its attention to a dispute regarding
measures for the conservation and management of fisheries. In short,
Spain talked of State sovereignty, Canada of fisheries conservation and
management. :

tion of common fisheries in which all have a right to participate, is of
course a completely different matter from a unilateral claim by a
coastal State to prevent fishing by foreign vessels entirely, or to
allow it only at the will and under the control of that State. The
question of conservation has therefore no relevance to the jurisdic-
tional issue now before the Court, which involves its competence to
adjudicate upon a dispute occasioned by Iceland's claim unilaterally
to assert exclusive jurisdiction for fishery purposes up to a distance of
50 nautical miles from and around her coasts.” (I. C.J. Reports 1973,
pp. 26-27; emphasis added.) (N.B. At the time there was no exclu-
sive economic zone and the distance referred to here actually takes
us onto the “high seas™.)

30. A glimmer of hope nevertheless emerges on reading paragraphs 34

arrest of its master, arising from Canada’s amended Coastal Fisher-


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 527

ies Protection Act and implementing regulations. The essence of the
dispute between the Parties is whether these acts violated Spain’s
rights under international law and require reparation. The Court
must now decide whether the Parties have conferred upon it jurisdic-
tion in respect of that dispute.”

31. But hope is rapidly extinguished. I thus find it astonishing that, on
the pretext of placing a legal characterization on the dispute submitted to
it by the applicant State, the Court so far overstepped the limits of the
operation whereby it sought to “clarify” the subject of that dispute as to
veer away towards a subject altogether different from that submitted to
it, notwithstanding that Spain, as a sovereign State and as applicant
State, had an uncontested procedural right — obviously at its own judi-
cial risk — to seise the Court of whatever subject it considered legitimate,
and an inalienable interest at law in seeking and obtaining judgment on
the specific dispute whose subject it had indicated with perfect clarity.
Such a decision represents a regrettable departure from the traditional
general view of the respective roles of applicant State, respondent State
and the Court.

+
* *

32. T have already said enough about the respective roles of Applicant
and Respondent. It remains to be more specific about that of the Court.
According to the Judgment, the Court is empowered “to determine on an
objective basis the dispute dividing the parties” (para. 30). I am afraid this
is not altogether correct. Adding the words “on an objective basis” can-
not lend acceptability to this power of “definition”, whose result here has
been to substitute one dispute for another. The Court can do no more
than attribute a “legal characterization” (and not a “definition”) to the
subject of the dispute. Where an act takes place on the high seas, the
Court must verify factually what that act is (in this case the “boarding”
of a fishing vessel), in what area it took place (“the high seas), and who
the author is (“Canada”). Those are facts. After that, it has to ascertain
whether the author of the act possesses a title, or legal ground, on which
to base its act, in order finally, in this phase of the proceedings, to be in
a position to rule on the question whether or not the title or legal ground
invoked is covered by Canada’s reservation (d).

33. In the Nuclear Tests cases (1974), the Court rejected certain argu-
ments put forward by one party as part of its submissions because it con-
sidered them “not as indications of what the party was asking the Court
to decide, but as reasons advanced why the Court should decide in the


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 528

sense contended for by that party”. In support of its decision, it cited the
Fisheries case, in which it had said that nine of the thirteen points making
up the Applicant’s submissions “[were] elements which might furnish
reasons in support of the Judgment, but cannot constitute the decision
(L.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 126)” (LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 262; emphasis
added).

In 1974 the Court considered itself legitimately entitled — and indeed
obliged — “to isolate the real issue in the case and to identify the object
of the claim” (para. 29; emphasis added), but not, at least according to
the intention there expressed, to proceed proprio motu to “the reformula-
tion of submissions”. In the same paragraph it made it clear, citing the
case-law of its predecessor (P.C.1J., Series A, No. 7, p. 35), that it had
no power to “substitute itself for [the parties] and formulate new submis-
sions”.

34. So aroused was the judges’ vigilance that, despite the majority’s
precautions in this regard, it was strongly criticized by the minority on
this issue. There is no better way of defining the limits upon the Court’s
duties than that set out by Judges Jiménez de Aréchaga, Dillard, Onyeama
and Sir Humphrey Waldock in their joint dissenting opinion in those
Nuclear Tests cases:

“11. In a case brought to the Court by means of an application
the formal submissions of the parties define the subject of the dis-
pute, as is recognized in paragraph 24 of the Judgment. Those sub-
missions must therefore be considered as indicating the objectives
which are pursued by an applicant through the judicial proceedings.

While the Court is entitled to interpret the submissions of the
parties, it is not authorized to introduce into them radical altera-
tions. The Permanent Court said in this respect: “. . . though it can
construe the submissions of the Parties, it cannot substitute itself for
them and formulate new submissions simply on the basis of argu-
ments and facts advanced’ (P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 7, p. 35, case con-
cerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia). The Judg-
ment (para. 29) refers to this as a limitation on the power of the
Court to interpret the submissions ‘when the claim is not properly
formulated because the submissions of the parties are inadequate’.
If, however, the Court lacks the power to reformulate inadequate
submissions, a fortiori it cannot reformulate submissions as clear
and specific as those in this case.

12. In any event, the cases cited in paragraph 29 of the Judgment
to justify the setting aside in the present instance of the Applicants
first submission do not, in our view, provide any warrant for such a
summary disposal of the ‘main prayer in the Application’. In those
cases the submissions held by the Court not to be true submissions
were specific propositions advanced merely to furnish reasons in
support of the decision requested of the Court in the ‘true’ final sub-
mission. Thus, in the Fisheries case the Applicant had summarized


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 529

in the form of submissions a whole series of legal propositions, some
not even contested, merely as steps logically leading to its true final
submissions (I. C.J. Reports 1951, pp. 121-123 and 126). In the Min-
quiers and Ecrehos case the ‘true’ final submission was stated first
and two legal propositions were then adduced by way of furnishing
alternative grounds on which the Court might uphold it (I. C.J.
Reports 1953, at p. 52); and in the Nottebohm case a submission
regarding the naturalization of Nottebohm in Liechtenstein was con-
sidered by the Court to be merely ‘a reason advanced for a decision
by the Court in favour of Liechtenstein’ on the ‘real issue’ of the
admissibility of the claim (I. C.J. Reports 1955, at p. 16). In the
present case, as we have indicated, the situation is quite otherwise.
The legality or illegality of the carrying out by France of atmos-
pheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific Ocean is the basic issue sub-
mitted to the Court’s decision, and it seems to us as wholly un-
justifiable to treat the Applicant’s request for a declaration of
illegality merely as reasoning advanced in support of its request for
an Order prohibiting further tests.

13. In accordance with these basic principles, the true nature of
the Australian claim, and of the objectives sought by the Applicant
ought to have been determined on the basis of the clear and natural
meaning of the text of its formal submission. The interpretation of
that submission made by the Court constitutes in our view not an
interpretation but a revision of the text, which ends in eliminating
what the Applicant stated is ‘the main prayer in the Application’,
namely the request for a declaration of illegality of nuclear atmos-
pheric tests in the South Pacific Ocean. A radical alteration or muti-
lation of an applicant’s submission under the guise of interpretation
has serious consequences because it constitutes a frustration of a
party’s legitimate expectations that the case which it has put before
the Court will be examined and decided . . .

14. The Judgment revises, we think, the Applicant’s submission
by bringing in other materials such as diplomatic communications
and statements made in the course of the hearings. These materials
do not justify, however, the interpretation arrived at in the Judg-
ment. They refer to requests made repeatedly by the Applicant for
an assurance from France as to the cessation of tests. But these
requests for an assurance cannot have the effect attributed to them
by the Judgment. While litigation is in progress an applicant may
address requests to a respondent to give an assurance that it will not
pursue the contested activity, but such requests cannot by them-
selves support the inference that an unqualified assurance, if received,
would satisfy all the objectives the applicant is seeking through the
judicial proceedings; still less can they restrict or amend the claims
formally submitted to the Court. According to the Rules of Court,
this can only result from a clear indication by the applicant to that


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 530

effect, through a withdrawal of the case, a modification of its sub-
missions or an equivalent action. It is not for nothing that the sub-
missions are required to be presented in writing and bear the signa-
ture of the agent. It is a non sequitur, therefore, to interpret such
requests for an assurance as constituting an implied renunciation, a
modification or a withdrawal of the claim which is still maintained
before the Court, asking for a judicial declaration of illegality of
atmospheric tests. At the very least, since the Judgment attributes
intentions and implied waivers to the Applicant, that Party should
have been given an opportunity to explain its real intentions and
objectives, instead of proceeding to such a determination inaudita
parte.” (I.C.J. Reports 1974, pp. 316-317.)

35. In relying in the present case on the 1974 French Nuclear Tests
cases, the Court seems to me, moreover, to have invoked a precedent
which is not apt to justify the faculty here accorded to Canada, the
respondent State, since France — the respondent State in 1974 — having
failed to appear, did not put forward any argument for a definition of the
subject of the dispute different from that formulated by the Applicant.

36. In the present case, the Court has relied on jurisprudence which
seems either not fully relevant, or to have been interpreted incorrectly. In
this respect I would first cite what I think is a particularly appropriate
passage from the Société Commerciale de Belgique case, which was itself
cited by the Court in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary
Activities in and against Nicaragua:

“It is to be observed that the liberty accorded to the parties to
amend their submissions up to the end of the oral proceedings
must be construed reasonably and without infringing the terms of
Article 40 of the Statute and Article 32, paragraph 2, of the Rules
which provide that the Application must indicate the subject of the
dispute . . . it is clear that the Court cannot, in principle, allow a
dispute brought before it by application to be transformed by amend-
ments in the submissions into another dispute which is different in
character. A practice of this kind would be calculated to prejudice
the interests of third States to which, under Article 40, paragraph 2,
of the Statute, all applications must be communicated in order that
they may be in a position to avail themselves of the right of interven-
tion provided for in Articles 62 and 63 of the Statute.” (P.C.LJ.,
Series AIB, No. 78, p. 173; see Military and Paramilitary Activities
in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America),
Jurisdiction and Admissibility, I. C.J. Reports 1984, p. 427, para. 80.)

It will be evident that this highly cautious piece of jurisprudence limits
even the power of the applicant State, the reason being to avoid prejudice


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 531

to third States which might wish to avail themselves of their right to
intervene in the proceedings.

37. Jurisprudence of a similar kind was again applied by the Court,
and with a similarly cautious approach, in the case concerning Certain
Phosphate Lands in Nauru:

“Article 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court provides that
the ‘subject of the dispute’ must be indicated in the Application; and
Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court requires ‘the precise
nature of the claim’ to be specified in the Application. These provi-
sions are so essential from the point of view of legal security and the
good administration of justice that they were already, in substance,
part of the text of the Statute of the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice, adopted in 1920 (Art. 40, first paragraph), and of the
text of the first Rules of that Court, adopted in 1922 (Art. 35, second
paragraph), respectively. On several occasions the Permanent Court
had to indicate the precise significance of these texts. Thus, in its
Order of 4 February 1933 in the case concerning the Prince von Pless
Administration (Preliminary Objection), it stated that:

‘under Article 40 of the Statute, it is the Application which sets
out the subject of the dispute, and the Case, though it may eluci-
date the terms of the Application, must not go beyond the limits
of the claim as set out therein . . > (P.C.LJ., Series A/B, No. 52,
p. 14).” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru ( Nauru v. Australia),
Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1992, pp. 266-
267, para. 69.)

Obviously, such vigilance on the part of the Court, in requiring even
the applicant State to remain within the specific confines of the subject of
the dispute submitted by it to the Court, is all the more appropriate in
relation to the respondent State and indeed to the Court itself, since not
only does it preclude the possibility of third States being deprived of their
right of intervention, but also — more crucially — it enables the Court
properly to adjudicate on its jurisdiction in light of the subject as defined
by the Applicant, and not of some other subject adduced subsequently by
the Applicant or by anyone else.

38. It would seem to me prudent in any event to preclude any notion
of placing the Respondent on a precisely equal footing with the Appli-
cant in relation to the definition of the subject of the dispute. Quite apart
from the infringement of procedural requirements, to allow the Respon-
dent an identical power in the determination of the subject of the dispute
would be to deny the possibility under the Statute of instituting proceed-
ings unilaterally by way of application, thus engendering the belief that
the Statute and the Rules of Court allowed parties no means of institut-
ing proceedings otherwise than by special agreement. However, what has
occurred in the present case strikes me as even more disturbing, inasmuch
as the Court’s reasoning has led it willy-nilly to place the Respondent not


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 532

merely on an equal footing with the Applicant but indeed above it, per-
mitting the former to substitute itself for the latter in “defining” the
subject of the dispute submitted to the Court by the applicant State.

39. As regards the Right of Passage over Indian Territory case, also
cited in the Judgment, one should of course bear in mind that this was a
case on the merits, settling a dispute concerning a condition ratione tem-
poris in India’s declaration of acceptance of the optional clause — a con-
dition which in the preliminary phase had been referred for final consid-
eration to the merits stage. A decision on that condition had thus been
joined to the merits because, in the light of the subject-matter of the dis-
pute, as established by Portugal, the applicant State, it was not exclu-
sively preliminary in character. The situation today is quite different,
since neither Canada nor Spain has submitted a memorial to the Court
on the merits. And the two cases differ in many other respects, to the
point at which any comparison becomes artificial. Spain has not altered
the subject of the dispute since it filed its Application. Canada has not
undertaken, either directly to Spain, or by making a unilateral declara-
tion as France did in 1974, to cease in future applying its domestic legis-
lation to vessels on the high seas. The subject of the dispute as set out in
the Spanish Application has remained as it was and no further element
whatsoever has emerged on either side. The Court should therefore have
decided the question of its jurisdiction in the light of that subject and
none other.

40. Turning now to the case concerning Maritime Delimitation and
Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain, mentioned in para-
graph 31 of the Judgment, it is not difficult to see that here too the situa-
tion was in no way comparable with that of the present case. As the
Court made it perfectly clear in its Judgment of 1 July 1994 (I.C.J.
Reports 1994, pp. 123-125, paras. 33-38), there was already a text —
called the “Bahraini formula” — which described the whole of the dispute
which the parties had agreed to bring before the Court. Since the Appli-
cation by Qatar, at whose instance the Court was seised, contained only
its own claims, the Court had still to be seised effectively of the whole of
the dispute. There was no question in the Court’s approach of its remod-
elling a “subject of the dispute”, which had already been clearly demar-
cated by the parties in a joint agreement; yet that is what the Court is
doing in the present case, under pretext of “itself determin[ing] the real
dispute that has been submitted to it” (para. 31; emphasis added). In
short, in the Qatar v. Bahrain case, the Court simply ensured that the
subject of the dispute, as agreed between the parties, was respected in its
entirety. The present case bears absolutely no relationship with the Qatar
v. Bahrain case.


FISHERIES JURISDICTION (DISS. OP. BEDJAOUI) 533

41. Lastly, as regards the Court’s power to determine its own jurisdic-
tion under Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute, that is to say, within
the limits of its sovereign discretion in relation to its own jurisdiction, it
must, as 1 have already pointed out, interpret the subject of the dispute,
but without in any way changing it, as the Respondent did. On this point,
the jurisprudence of the present Court’s predecessor demonstrates admi-
rable caution. The Permanent Court of International Justice did not per-
mit itself either to alter, or even merely to “correct”, the subject of the
dispute where the applicant State had formulated it inadequately, but
merely asked the Applicant itself to correct the subject of the dispute; on
