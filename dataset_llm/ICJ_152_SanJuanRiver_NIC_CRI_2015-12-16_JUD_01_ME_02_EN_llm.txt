                        1. I have voted in favour of the conclusions reached by the Court in
                      the operative part (dispositif) of the present Judgment, as I have no dis-
                      agreement with these conclusions as such. It is my view, however, that
                      certain specific aspects of the reasoning (ratio decidendi) of the Judgment
                      that have led the Court to these conclusions have not been developed
                      with sufficient clarity in the reasoning part (motifs) of the Judgment. For
                      this reason, I wish to attach this opinion of mine, with a view to elaborat-
                      ing my own view on these points as I see them in the reasoning of the
                      Judgment. (It goes without saying that I do not intend to put my own
                      words into the language of the Judgment, but wish to explain how I see
                      certain points covered by the Judgment.)

                         2. In my view, the question of sovereignty over the “disputed territory”
                      constitutes the central issue of the dispute brought before the Court
                      in 2010 by Costa Rica in relation to certain activities conducted by Nica-
                      raguan authorities. In the present Judgment, while the Court has rightly
                      concluded that the legal instruments relevant for determining sovereignty
                      over the “disputed territory” should be the 1858 Treaty, the Cleve-
                      land Award of 1888 and the Alexander Award of 1897, the language of
                      the Judgment does not seem to have been sufficiently articulate on the
                      logical sequence that exists between these relevant legal instruments.
                      Thus, on the issue of territorial sovereignty, which should be the prereq-
                      uisite for determining the concrete allegations by the Applicant of viola-
                      tions of sovereignty by the Respondent, the Judgment summarily
                      concludes that “Articles II and VI [of the 1858 Treaty], taken together,
                      provide that the right bank of a channel of the river forms the boundary
                      on the assumption that this channel is a navigable ‘outlet of commerce’”
                      (Judgment, para. 76).
                         3. For the purpose of our analysis of these documents, however, the
                      Court in my view should start from the premise that what is determina-
                      tive in this case is first and foremost the interpretation of the 1858 Treaty
                      and then to pursue the logical sequence of the relevant legal instruments,
                      i.e., first the 1858 Treaty, then the Cleveland Award, which was meant to
                      give an authoritative interpretation of the 1858 Treaty, and finally the
                      Alexander Awards, which were given under the mandate of General Alex-
                      ander to demarcate the boundary and to implement the Cleveland Award,
                      in light of their assigned roles and purposes in their contexts. In my view,

                      thus, the central issue that determines the issue of sovereignty over the
                      disputed territory is not the identification of the geographical location of
                      “the first channel met”, used in the first Alexander Award, among the
                      many watercourses that could have existed (or now exist) in the wetland
                      of the disputed territory, as some of the counsel have tried to persuade
                      the Court. In my view, however, the Court’s task is rather to apply the
                      basic interpretative reasoning followed by General Alexander within the
                      scope of his mandate under the Pacheco‑Matus Convention of 1896, to
                      “proceed with [the demarcation] of the border line” on the basis of the
                      1858 Treaty and the Award rendered in 1888 by President Cleveland, who
                      had been entrusted with the task of deciding upon, inter alia, “all . . .
                      points of doubtful interpretation which either of the parties may find in
                      the [1858 Treaty]”, and thus of giving an authoritative interpretation of
                      the 1858 Treaty. Under these circumstances, the task for the Court has
                      not and cannot have been literally to follow the line described in the first
                      Alexander Award in 1897, particularly as General Alexander already was
                      faced with the difficulty of investigating what the Cleveland Award had
                      established as the authoritative interpretation of the 1858 Treaty, because
                      of the changed geography of the area over the intervening 30 years. The
                      resolution by the Court of the question of territorial sovereignty over the
                      disputed territory in this situation is to be based on the same legal sources
                      (i.e., the national boundary as determined by the 1858 Treaty) and the
                      same legal reasoning that General Alexander applied in implementing the
                      Cleveland Award of 1888, which, even after the passage of 30 years, pro-
                      vided the authoritative and binding interpretation and determination of
                      the boundary prescribed by the 1858 Treaty.

                         4. It is this reasoning in my view that General Alexander applied in his
                      first Award of 30 September 1897, when considering how the natural ter-
                      minus of the San Juan River (which used to be the “right‑hand headland
                      of the harbour mouth”) as determined by the 1858 Treaty could reach the
                      San Juan River proper following what used to be the San Juan River’s
                      right bank. Already at the time of the first Alexander Award, the only
                      possible way to identify the navigable waterway (as contrasted to any
                      watercourse) that connected this “natural terminus” of the San Juan
                      River to the Lower San Juan River was to follow the edge of the Har-
                      bor Head Lagoon until it reached the San Juan River proper. If we trans-
                      fer this reasoning to the present situation, the contour of the territory
                      following from General Alexander’s underlying reasoning, rather than
                      the actual boundary line that he demarcated on the ground at that time,
                      would unequivocally lead one to the conclusion that the disputed terri-
                      tory is under Costa Rican sovereignty.

                         5. Incidentally, in understanding the prescriptive description of the
                      first Alexander Award, it is useful to note that the term used by Gen-
                      eral Alexander was “the first channel met” (emphasis added), and not

                      lish Dictionary, denotes as a geographic term “[a] (comparatively) narrow
                      piece of water, wider than a mere ‘strait’, connecting two larger pieces,
                      usually seas”. This would appear to be the proper definition of the term
                      for establishing what General Alexander had in mind, assuming that the
                      first Alexander Award was originally drafted in English.) Be that as it
                      may, there seems to be no doubt that General Alexander came to the
                      conclusion that this “channel” was the one to follow in determining the
                      boundary line as defined by the 1858 Treaty and interpreted by the Cleve-
                      land Award, not because General Alexander found that it was there as

                      water along the Harbor Head Lagoon, but because he acted on his under-
                      standing that this “first channel” represented part of the main stream of
                      water flowing from the San Juan River proper leading to the starting-
                      point of the boundary line which was at the mouth of the river. In other
                      words, General Alexander was trying faithfully to follow the prescription
                      of the 1858 Treaty contained in its Article II, namely that:
                              “The dividing line between the two Republics, starting from the
                           Northern Sea, shall begin at the end of Punta de Castilla, at the mouth
                           of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, and shall run along the right bank
                           of the said river up to a point three English miles distant from Cas‑
                           tillo Viejo . . .” (Emphasis added.)
                        6. The third Alexander Award is also indicative of the reasoning of
                      General Alexander, inasmuch as it explicitly affirms that the position of
                      the boundary line will be altered only by “changes in the banks or channels
                      of the river . . . as may be determined by the rules of international law
                      applicable on a case‑by‑case basis” (third Alexander Award, RIAA,
                      Vol. XXVIII, p. 230 ; emphasis added), and not just by any watercourse
                      that can serve the purpose of letting water pass from the San Juan River
                      proper to the Harbor Head Lagoon.

                         7. In other words, if we translate the language and transfer the reason-
                      ing of the Alexander Awards to the present‑day geographical situation of
                      the area, there could be no question that the reasoning underlying the
                      first Alexander Award would lead to the unequivocal outcome that the
                      Court has reached in the present Judgment on the question of sovereignty
                      over the disputed territory. The task of the Court is simply to apply the
                      reasoning of General Alexander in his first Award in a geographically
                      generic, though not geodetically specific, manner to the boundary as pre-
                      scribed in the 1858 Treaty, in order to reach the conclusion on the issue
                      of sovereignty over the disputed territory. For this purpose, the Court has
                      only to proceed from the “natural terminus” of the Lower San Juan River
                      determined in the 1858 Treaty as interpreted by the Cleveland Award and
                      as subsequently implemented by the Alexander Awards. This “natural
                      terminus” is, as was determined by General Alexander in his first Award,
                      “the north-western extremity of what seems to be the solid land, on the
                      east side of the Harbor Head Lagoon” (first Alexander Award, RIAA,





5 Ord 1088.indb 170                                                                                  19/10/16 12:01

                      749 	certain activities and construction of a road (sep. op. owada)

                      Vol. XXVIII, p. 220). Having thus identified the terminus of the bound-
                      ary, the determination of sovereignty over the disputed territory flows
                      from the boundary line that runs along the right bank of the river. Of
                      course, such a riverine connection between the Harbor Head Lagoon and
                      the San Juan River itself is no longer in existence at the present time. In
                      this situation, the only logical way to draw that boundary line connecting
                      what was “the right‑hand headland of the harbour mouth” to the
                      San Juan River is to follow the edge of the Harbor Head Lagoon until it
                      reaches the present‑day stream of the San Juan River proper. Once this
                      line reaches the right bank of the river, the boundary line must turn
                      upstream as the 1858 Treaty prescribes.

                      provided the Court with a number of arguments, including references to
                      effectivités, and have produced a range of supporting evidentiary materi-
                      als, such as maps, witness affidavits, and expert statements relating to
                      fluvial morphology and other aspects of the geographical context of the
                      disputed territory, all relating to the question of whether or not any navi-
                      gable channels might have traversed or currently traverse the disputed
                      territory. The Judgment has assessed the evidentiary merit of all these
                      materials for determining the question of territorial sovereignty, but has
                      come to the conclusion that their evidentiary value was not determinative
                      of the question of sovereignty. My own conclusion is that the totality of
                      such evidence amounts in fact to very little that is material or conclusive
                      for determining the question of territorial sovereignty over the disputed
                      territory, to the extent that the central issue that is determinative of the
                      question is the content of the 1858 Treaty, as interpreted by the Cleveland
                      Award and subsequently implemented by the Alexander Awards.

                         9. In my view, what is involved in the present dispute is not, in its fun-
                      damental nature, the situation of a classical territorial dispute that is nor-
                      mally brought before the International Court of Justice for judicial
                      settlement. A territorial dispute is typically presented to the Court after
                      attempts by the parties at an exchange of views in order to identify the
                      existence of a difference of positions on an issue and following a process of
                      negotiations for its peaceful settlement. In the present case, however, the
                      territorial dispute has been caused primarily by unilateral action taken in
                      the form of a physical incursion by one State into the territory of another
                      State that had been primarily held for many years by the latter State. This
                      appreciation of the nature of the dispute in the present case is apparent
                      from the language of the Judgment itself (Judgment, paras. 67‑69 and
                      para. 229 (2)), including in addition its finding that Nicaragua breached
                      the Court’s Order of 8 March 2011, inter alia, by establishing a military
                      presence in the disputed territory (ibid., para. 229 (3)). Whatever validity

                      the claim by the Respondent over the disputed territory may have had,
                      such a unilateral act of incursion by that State would amount to some-
                      thing more than an incidental violation of the territorial sovereignty of
                      that latter State.
                         10. In my view, given this undisputable circumstance, it would have
                      been appropriate for the Court to have treated the actions by Nicaragua

                      ally wrongful act, which could arguably constitute an unlawful use of
                      force under Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter. An act of this
                      nature would generally entail an obligation to undertake remedial mea-
                      sures, including reparation, going beyond a mere obligation to achieve
                      the restitutio in integrum of the status quo ante.
                         11. While I have concurred with the Court’s decision to consider
                      that an incursion has taken place, but to refrain from going further into
                      the question of what other legal consequences of this incursion should
                      follow in light of the Court’s finding that “by excavating three caños and
                      establishing a military presence on Costa Rican territory, Nicaragua
                      has violated the territorial sovereignty of Costa Rica” (Judgment,
                      para. 229 (2), see also para. 229 (3)), it is my view that it would have been
                      more appropriate for the Court to have gone further by declaring that
                      these internationally wrongful acts by Nicaraguan authorities consti-
                      tuted an unlawful use of force under Article 2 (4) of the United Nations
                      Charter.
                         12. The present Judgment has not pursued that course, limiting itself to
                      the factual finding of an incursion as referred to above, without going into
                      any further discussion on the possible legal consequences of such an incur-
                      sion. A reference made to the Judgment in the Cameroon v. Nigeria case
                      of 2002 in this context to justify this approach would seem to be quite
                      inappropriate. In that earlier Judgment, the Court had concluded that
                           “by the very fact of the present Judgment and of the evacuation of
                           the Cameroonian territory occupied by Nigeria, the injury suffered by
                           Cameroon by reason of the occupation of its territory will in all events
                           have been sufficiently addressed. The Court will not therefore seek to
                           ascertain whether and to what extent Nigeria’s responsibility to Cam-
                           eroon has been engaged as a result of that occupation.” (Land and
                           Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v.
                           Nigeria : Equatorial Guinea intervening), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports

                      This reference to the case of Cameroon v. Nigeria in my view could be
                      quite misleading as the Cameroon v. Nigeria case is qualitatively different
                      from the present case and should clearly be distinguished from the pres-
                      ent situation, inasmuch as the former case, different from the present
                      case, had not been caused by an action of one party to alter the existing
                      status quo through unilateral means. The Judgment should in my view
                      have taken a more correct approach in its characterization of such a
                      ­blatant case of incursion and its legal consequences.

                         13. In their written and oral pleadings, both Parties invoked the exis-
                      tence of a legal obligation under general international law not to cause
                      significant transboundary harm. The existence of such an obligation has
                      been confirmed in some of the Court’s past decisions, including, in par-
                      ticular, its Judgment in the case concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uru‑
                      guay (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I),
                      pp. 55‑56, para. 101).
                         14. In the process of carrying out the obligation to act in due diligence
                      under international environmental law, the requirement of conducting an
                      environmental impact assessment becomes a key element for determining
                      whether certain activities may cause significant transboundary harm. This
                      requirement comes to play a significant role in both of the joined cases in
                      the present proceedings. The issue of environmental impact assessment
                      has been raised by both Parties against each other respectively in each of
                      the joint cases. In this context, they seemed to quote approvingly the dic-
                      tum from the Court’s Judgment in the Pulp Mills case.

                         15. In its Judgment in the Pulp Mills case, the Court referred to the
                      environmental impact assessment as “a practice, which in recent years has
                      gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered
                      a requirement under general international law” (ibid., p. 83, para. 204).

                      the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which in its 2011 Advi-
                      sory Opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring
                      Persons and Entities with respect to Activities in the Area appears to have
                      gone a step further by declaring that an environmental impact assessment
                      as such is a “general obligation under customary international law”.
                      More specifically, it states as follows: “It should be stressed that the
                      ­obligation to conduct an environmental impact assessment is a direct obli‑
                       gation under the [UNCLOS] and a general obligation under customary
                       international law.” (Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring

                        sis added.)

                        17. By comparison, the reasoning of this Court in its Judgment in the
                      Pulp Mills case appears to take a more nuanced approach to this require-
                      ment, when it circumscribes the scope and content of such an environ-
                      mental impact assessment in the following manner :

                           “general international law [does not] specify the scope and content of
                           an environmental impact assessment . . . Consequently, it is the view

                           of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic
                           ­legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific
                            content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case,
                            having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed develop-
                            ment and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to
                            the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment.”
                            (Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment,
                            I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 83, para. 205 ; emphasis added.)

                      The Court also stressed the continuous nature of the process of environ-
                      mental impact assessment on a case‑by‑case basis, as follows :
                           “an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the
                           implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started
                           and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous
                           monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken.”
                           (Ibid., pp. 83‑84, para. 205.)
                         18. These statements of the Court in its Judgment in the Pulp Mills
                      case would seem to suggest that in the dictum quoted in paragraph 15
                      above, the Court emphasized the crucial importance of this element in the
                      context of the process of carrying out the obligation of due diligence,
                      which is a holistic process. To summarize, conducting an environmental
                      impact assessment is one important constituent element of the process
                      that emanates from the international obligation of States to act in due
                      diligence to avoid or mitigate significant transboundary harm, rather
                      than a separate and independent obligation standing on its own under
                      general international law. This obligation to act with due diligence in
                      such a way that the initiation of potentially environmentally hazardous
                      activities may be avoided constitutes an established obligation of interna-
                      tional environmental law. In this holistic process, an environmental
                      impact assessment plays an important and even crucial role in ensuring
                      that the State in question is acting with due diligence under general inter-
                      national environmental law. It should also be noted that in the Pulp Mills
                      case there was no need for the Court to establish this requirement of envir­
                      onmental impact assessment as a general legal obligation of international
                      environmental law or to define its limits under customary international
                      law, to the extent that the case hinged upon the construction of the
                      1975 Statute, which was a lex specialis applicable to that case.

                        19. Against this background the Court in the present Judgment can be
                      said in my view to have maintained this balanced approach when it stated
                      as follows :
                           “to fulfil its obligation to exercise due diligence in preventing signifi-
                           cant transboundary environmental harm, a State must, before
                           embarking on an activity having the potential adversely to affect the
                           environment of another State, ascertain if there is a risk of significant

                      753 	certain activities and construction of a road (sep. op. owada)

                           transboundary harm, which would trigger the requirement to carry
                           out an environmental impact assessment.

                               Determination of the content of the environmental impact assess-
                           ment should be made in light of the specific circumstances of each case.
                           �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                               If the environmental impact assessment confirms that there is a risk

                           the activity is required, in conformity with its due diligence obligation,
                           to notify and consult in good faith with the potentially affected State,
                           where that is necessary to determine the appropriate measures to pre-
                           vent or mitigate that risk.” (Judgment, para. 104.)
                         20. Based on this reasoning, the Court has held in the operative part of
                      its Judgment that: “Costa Rica has violated its obligation under general
                      international law by failing to carry out an environmental impact assess-
                      ment concerning the construction of Route 1856” (ibid., para. 229 (6)).

                         21. In sum, the environmental impact assessment, which is essentially of
                      a technical nature, is a means to achieve the ultimate objective of preventing
                      transboundary harm — an obligation relating to the due diligence required.
                      In addition, an environmental impact assessment serves the purpose of
                      enabling the public or civil society to participate in the ultimate decision‑­
                      making process on activities with potentially significant environmental effects.
                      Significant as the environmental impact assessment may be, as reflecting pre-
                      vailing practice in recent years, the fact remains that the function of the
                      environmental impact assessment is essentially one of a number of means to
                      be employed when the circumstances of the case so require, in order to attain
                      the ultimate legal objective that is binding upon States acting in the environ-
                      mental field — an obligation to act with due diligence in order to prevent
                      significant transboundary harm in the light of the assessed risks involved.
                         22. The present Judgment is in my view based on this position, as dem-
                      onstrated by the passages of the Judgment quoted above. The relevant
                      activities by States are to be reviewed in the specific circumstances of the
                      case in light of this obligation of due diligence, through verifying whether
                      the State has acted with due diligence, as evidenced by such elements as
                      taking necessary measures to prevent significant transboundary harm, as
                      it is the case here with Costa Rica in relation to its construction of the
                      road, or with Nicaragua in relation to the undertaking of its dredging
                      activities. Conducting an environmental impact assessment is one impor-
                      tant element (though not necessarily constituting an indispensable obliga-
                      tion as such) in the process of fulfilling the obligation of acting with due
                      diligence to prevent significant transboundary harm in each case.
