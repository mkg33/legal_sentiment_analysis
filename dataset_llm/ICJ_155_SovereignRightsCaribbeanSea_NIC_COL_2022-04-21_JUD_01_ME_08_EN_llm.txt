                       Article 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS reflects customary international law on
                    the contiguous zone in respect of the powers that a coastal State may exercise in
                    that zone — It is significant that, at the Third United Nations Conference on the
                    Law of the Sea, there were no proposals to add other matters to the list in
                    Article 33, paragraph 1.
                       Article 56, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS provides that, in the exclusive economic
                    zone, the coastal State has (a) sovereign rights over natural resources and
                    (b) jurisdiction with regard to the protection of the marine environment — In
                    addition, paragraph 1 (c) indicates that the coastal State has “other rights”
                    provided for in UNCLOS — Nicaragua has freedom of navigation in its exclusive
                    economic zone — Colombia’s integral contiguous zone infringes not only on
                    Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction but also on Nicaragua’s freedom of
                    navigation in its exclusive economic zone.

                       2. The Court finds that Article 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS reflects
                    customary international law on the contiguous zone in respect of the
                    powers that a coastal State may exercise in that zone (Judgment,
                    para. 155). Thus, the powers that a coastal State may exercise in its con-
                    tiguous zone are confined to those set out in that provision, namely “cus-
                    toms”, “fiscal”, “immigration”, and “sanitary” matters. A coastal State
                    may not exercise, in its contiguous zone, control with respect to security
                    matters (ibid., para. 154).
                       3. In support of the above conclusions, the Court notes that a Polish
                    proposal to add “security” to the list of matters was rejected at the First
                    United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958, and that the
                    wording of Article 24, paragraph 1, of the 1958 Convention on
                    the ­Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone was adopted in Article 33,
                    paragraph 1, of UNCLOS “without any change as regards the matters
                    in respect of which the coastal State may exercise control” (ibid.,
                    para. 153).
                       4. In my view, it is also significant that, at the Third United Nations
                    Conference on the Law of the Sea, there were no proposals to add other
                    matters to the list. Of the more than 80 proposals submitted to the Con-
                    ference’s Second Committee, which dealt with a broad range of items,


                    425 	 sovereign rights and maritime spaces (decl. iwasawa)

                    only two proposals concerned the contiguous zone 1. Neither of them
                    was a proposal to add other matters to the list. It was on this basis that
                    Article 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS adopted the wording of Article 24,
                    paragraph 1, of the 1958 Convention without any change as regards the
                    matters in respect of which the coastal State may exercise control in its
                    contiguous zone.

                       5. Nicaragua contends that Colombia’s integral contiguous zone estab-
                    lished by Presidential Decree 1946 “is not consistent with international
                    law”, first, because the limits of the integral contiguous zone exceed the
                    maximum breadth allowed by international law, and secondly, because
                    the powers Colombia grants itself in the contiguous zone “exceed what
                    international law allows” 2.
                       6. The Court finds that Colombia’s integral contiguous zone is indeed
                    “not in conformity with customary international law” (Judgment,
                    paras. 187, 194, 196, and 261 (5)) in two respects. First, the geographical
                    extent of the integral contiguous zone contravenes the 24‑nautical‑mile
                    rule for the establishment of the contiguous zone. Secondly, certain pow-
                    ers conferred on Colombia by Presidential Decree 1946 extend to matters
                    that are not permitted by customary international law as reflected in Arti-
                    cle 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS (ibid., para. 187).
                       7. With regard to the second respect, the Court further finds that the
                    integral contiguous zone infringes upon Nicaragua’s “sovereign rights
                    and jurisdiction” in its exclusive economic zone (ibid., paras. 194
                    and 196).
                       8. Article 56, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS provides that, in the exclusive
                    economic zone, the coastal State has (a) sovereign rights for the purpose
                    of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural
                    resources and (b) jurisdiction with regard to such matters as marine s­ cientific
                    research and the protection and preservation of the marine environ­ment.
                    Paragraph 1 (c) further indicates that the coastal State also has “other
                    rights and duties provided for in this Convention”.

                    426 	 sovereign rights and maritime spaces (decl. iwasawa)

                       9. There is no doubt that the coastal State has freedom of navigation
                    in its exclusive economic zone. Article 87, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS pro-
                    vides that “[t]he high seas are open to all States, whether coastal or land-­
                    locked” and that “[f]reedom of the high seas . . . comprises . . . (a) freedom
                    of navigation”. Article 90 of UNCLOS provides that “[e]very State . . .
                    has the right to sail ships flying its flag on the high seas”. The coastal
                    State can establish its exclusive economic zone up to 200 nautical miles
                    from its baselines. That area is subject to a specific legal régime, which
                    confers additional rights and duties on the coastal State. However, the
                    freedoms the coastal State had on the high seas before establishing its
                    exclusive economic zone continue to exist in that zone. In The “Enrica
                    Lexie” Incident case, India argued that it had freedom of navigation in its
                    exclusive economic zone “pursuant to Article 87, paragraph 1, subpara-
                    graph (a) and Article 90” of UNCLOS 3, and the arbitral tribunal
                    ­confirmed that Articles 87 and 90 “apply equally to the exclusive eco-
                    nomic zone” 4.

                       10. The Court finds that the scope of Colombia’s powers within its
                    integral contiguous zone to prevent and control infringements of laws
                    and regulations, as set out in Article 5 (3) of Presidential Decree 1946, “is
                    much broader than the material scope of the powers enumerated in Arti-
                    cle 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS” (Judgment, para. 176).

                       11. The Court observes that the power to protect “national maritime
                    interests” in Article 5 (3), through its broad wording alone, “appears to
                    encroach on the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Nicaragua” (ibid.,
                    para. 178). As regards the power for “the preservation of the environ-
                    ment” in Article 5 (3), the Court finds that it is contrary to Article 56,
                    paragraph 1(b) (iii), of UNCLOS, which grants Nicaragua jurisdiction
                    with regard to the “protection and preservation of the marine environ-
                    ment” (ibid.).

                     and “conduct contrary to security in the sea”, Nicaragua argues that
                     “[n]either of these matters is covered by customary international law” and
                     that Article 5 (3) therefore “is inconsistent with international law” 5. The
                    Court finds that “[t]he inclusion of security in the material scope of
                    Colombia’s powers” is indeed “not in conformity with the relevant
                    ­customary rule” (Judgment, para. 177). However, the Court refrains from
                     finding that this power encroaches on Nicaragua’s “sovereign rights and
                     jurisdiction” in its exclusive economic zone. This is appropriate because
                     this power does not, in itself, affect Nicaragua’s sovereign rights over
                     natural resources or jurisdiction with regard to the protection and
                     preservation of the marine environment. However, it unquestionably
                     ­
                     encroaches on Nicaragua’s freedom of navigation in its exclusive eco-
                     nomic zone.

                      13. In its final submissions, Nicaragua requests the Court to adjudge
                    and declare that,
                             “[b]y its conduct, the Republic of Colombia has breached its interna-
                             tional obligation to respect Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited
                             in . . . the Court Judgment of 19 November 2012, as well as Nicara-
                             gua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones” (ibid., para. 24;
                             emphasis added).
                    The first part of this request of Nicaragua is made in broader terms than
                    the second part.
                       14. In respect of Colombia’s integral contiguous zone, Nicaragua con-
                    tends that “Colombia has infringed and is infringing upon Nicaragua’s
                    maritime zone while implementing its integral contiguous zone” 6. Some
                    incidents alleged by Nicaragua in support of this contention point to
                    Colombia’s encroachment on Nicaragua’s freedom of navigation rather
                    than its sovereign rights and jurisdiction. For example, according to
                    Nicaragua, a Colombian naval vessel intercepted a Nicaraguan coast
                    guard vessel on patrol and demanded that it withdraw from Colombia’s
                    integral contiguous zone, claiming that it was in Colombian waters 7.
                    These incidents did not necessarily affect Nicaragua’s sovereign rights
                    over natural resources or jurisdiction with regard to the protection and
                    preservation of the marine environment, but they certainly encroached on
                    Nicaragua’s freedom of navigation in its exclusive economic zone.

                    ments as such (Judgment, para. 189) and concludes that Colombia’s
                    integ­ral contiguous zone infringes upon Nicaragua’s “sovereign rights
                    and jurisdiction” in its exclusive economic zone (ibid., paras. 194 and 196).
                    However, in my view, Colombia’s integral contiguous zone infringes not
                    only on Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction but also on
                    ­Nicaragua’s freedom of navigation in its exclusive economic zone.

                       16. As regards appropriate remedies in this respect, the Court finds
                    that Colombia must, by means of its own choosing, bring into conformity
                    with customary international law the provisions of Presidential
                    Decree 1946, “in so far as they relate to maritime areas declared by the
                    Court in its 2012 Judgment to appertain to Nicaragua” (ibid.,
                    paras. 196 and 261 (6)). The Court indicates a remedy in this form
                    in response to Nicaragua’s request in its final submissions (ibid., para. 24).
