I am largely in agreement with the Court’s Judgment and accordingly
I have voted for most of its operative paragraphs. | have voted against
operative paragraph 1B essentially because I view the construction of
“Variant C”, the “provisional solution”, as inseparable from its being put
into operation. I have voted against operative paragraph 1 D essentially
because I am not persuaded that Hungary's position as the Party initially
in breach deprived it of a right to terminate the Treaty in response to
Czechoslovakia’s material breach, a breach which in my view (as indi-
cated by my vote on paragraph |B) was in train when Hungary gave
notice of termination.

At the same time, I fully support the conclusions of the Court as to
what should be the future conduct of the Parties and as to disposition of
issues of compensaion.
