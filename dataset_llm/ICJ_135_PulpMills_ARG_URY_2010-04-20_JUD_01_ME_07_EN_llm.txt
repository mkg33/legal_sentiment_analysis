 1. I endorse many of the conclusions reached by the Court in its Judg-
ent. Indeed, I fully support those concerning the scope of the Court’s
  isdiction and the applicable law, the burden of proof and expert evi-
 nce, the rejection of the Applicant’s claims that the Respondent
 eached its substantive obligations, and the dismantling of the Orion
 otnia) mill in Fray Bentos.
 2. In respect of the procedural obligations borne by the Respondent, I
 o fully endorse the conclusions in the Judgment relating to the rejec-
 n of the supposed “strict link” between the procedural and substantive
 ligations, and the alleged “no construction obligation” said to be
 rne by the Respondent between the end of the negotiation period and
e decision of the Court ; I also agree that satisfaction is appropriate
paration. However, I do not support the conclusions on the breaches
und in the Judgment concerning certain procedural obligations of the
  spondent. It is for this reason that I am appending a separate opinion
  the Judgment.

      1. CARU and Its Role in the Prior Consultation Process
     under Articles 7 to 12 of the Statute of the River Uruguay

 5. The way counsel for the Applicant presented the “Comisión
 ministradora del Río Uruguay” (CARU) (linchpin ; key body) proved
fluential. For my part, I do not have the slightest reservation on the
 portance or central role of CARU in the administration of the River
 uguay, first acknowledged by the Court in its Orders for the
dication of provisional measures, but this is no reason to mistake its
 ture or role in the consultation process under Articles 7 to 12 of the
atute.
 6. CARU is a joint river commission, a shared instrument, which
nctions on a permanent basis and has its own secretariat (Art. 52 of the
atute). The Parties have made it a legal entity in order to perform its
nctions (Art. 50). The functions of CARU are defined in paragraphs (a)
 (k) of Article 56 of the Statute, paragraph (l) of which states that the
ommission performs any other functions assigned to it by the Statute
 d those which the Parties may entrust to it through an exchange of
 tes or any other form of agreement.

7. CARU’s State members are Argentina and Uruguay. It is made up
 an equal number of members from each Party (Art. 49), who are
pointed by their Minister for Foreign Affairs. The members make up
o delegations, one Argentine and the other Uruguayan, each of which
s one vote for the adoption of decisions (Art. 55). Decisions must be
animous, including those on procedural issues. A delegation’s vote
ainst a decision precludes its adoption by CARU. In addition, the


ommission’s activities can be brought to a standstill by the absence of a
legation or by failure to appoint members of a delegation, which
curred in the circumstances surrounding the present case. CARU’s
 ecision-making” is strictly dependent on the desire of the two delegations
 act in concert.

8. Although it has been made a legal entity in order to perform its
nctions, this does not mean that CARU is a body independent of the
rties, or that the Parties cannot agree to dispense with procedures or
her measures falling within CARU’s ambit : ultimately, the Commis-
 n is an instrument of the two Ministries of Foreign Affairs for facili-
 ing co-operation between the Parties as riparian States along the
ver Uruguay, through ongoing and regular joint management on
e. In any case, in the present proceedings it has not been shown
at CARU is a subject of international law independent of the
rties.

 . The Application of the Obligation to Inform CARU as Laid Down
by Article 7, Paragraph 1, of the Statute Raises a Preliminary Issue
        relating to the Initial Characterization of the Project
14. Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Statute lays down two procedural
 ligations, one borne by the Party planning the work and the other
 rne by CARU. The first of these obligations in effect plays the role of
terminative factor in respect of the second, because if the Party plan-
ng the work does not inform CARU of it, the project has not been
 erred to the Commission and the Commission will therefore be unable


 determine on a preliminary basis within thirty days whether the project
liable to cause significant damage to the other Party.
 15. However, the obligation of the Party planning the work to inform
ARU does not apply to all projects. CARU only has to be informed of
ose projects which are of sufficient size (“entidad suficiente” in the
 thentic Spanish text) to make them “liable” to affect the navigation,
e régime of the river or the quality of its waters. Therefore, the
nguage itself of Article 7, paragraph 1, introduces a precondition,
 ving to do with the characterization of the project, into the modus
 erandi of the rule : before informing CARU of it, it must be determined
hether or not the project in question falls within the scope of the
 ligation to inform CARU laid down by the said provision of the Stat-
e.
 16. However, Article 7 leaves this initial characterization to the Party
anning the work, namely, the territorial sovereign, without prejudice to
e other Party’s right to dispute this initial characterization. For instance,
  light of the documents submitted to the Court, it is clear that,
tween the initial environmental authorization (AAP) of the CMB
 NCE) mill on 9 October 2003 and the Bielsa-Opertti Agreement of
 March 2004 (see below), there was undoubtedly a disagreement
tween the Parties as to the interpretation and application of Article 7,
 ragraph 1, resulting from Uruguay’s initial characterization of the
MB (ENCE) project.
 17. The Applicant’s own conduct in this matter also provides striking
nfirmation that Argentina has always believed that it has the right to
ake the initial characterization of its own projects and industrial instal-
 ions. In point of fact, it has never informed CARU of any of its own
ojects or industrial installations (whether or not large or polluting) :
me 170 firms according to the material in the record, including some
oducing waste material which is highly polluting to the river and
 uatic environment. Moreover, during the oral proceedings of the
esent case, Argentina reaffirmed its right to make the initial characteri-
tion of its own industrial projects. In this connection, it should be
membered that the condition laid down in Article 7 (entidad suficiente)
 es not refer to a solely quantitative criterion, but to a qualitative/
 antitative one, and that Article 28 of the Statute states that every six
onths the Parties are supposed to submit a detailed report to CARU of
e developments they undertake or authorize in the parts of the river
 der their jurisdictions, in order that the Commission may verify whether
e developments taken together may cause significant damage.

 3. The Practice relating to the Obligation to Inform CARU under
   Article 7, Paragraph 1, of the Statute in the Case of National
                         Industrial Projects
19. The CARU minutes, for example those from 1996 relating to the
 anspapel pulp mill, offer a good illustration of how the issue of the
nitial characterization” of planned works by the territorial State, which
 ses whenever the obligation to inform CARU under Article 7, para-
aph 1, of the Statute applies, has always been kept in mind in situations
volving plans for national industrial plants by one or other of
e Parties on their respective side of the river (and not on the river
elf). CARU members have in fact raised this matter on numerous
casions in the past and their responses have been far from
nsistent.

20. The exchanges between Julio C. Carasales (Argentina) and Edi-
n González Lapeyre (Uruguay) during the Transpapel project are very
ling in this regard. Moreover, they show that the main concern in
ARU in this connection has always been to preserve the quality of the
 ters of the river and not for CARU to intervene, in one form or
other, in the national industrial projects of either country. Ambassador
 rasales (Argentina) could not have put it in clearer terms when he
 ted in 1996 :
   “the pertinent studies by the appropriate national authorities of
   Uruguay having been completed, and the authorization for the
   placement [of the Transpapel plant] having been granted, the Admin-
   istrative Commission of the Uruguay River does not have compe-
   tence to express an opinion on a facility in the territory of one of the
   parties. Once that plant is operating and in production, if it causes
   contamination problems, the C.A.R.U. will have statutory power to
   intervene in the matter.” (Uruguay’s Counter-Memorial, Vol. IV,
   Ann. 80, p. 203.)

 21. The position adopted by Mr. Opertti, Uruguay’s Minister for

I. POINTS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN THE PRESENT CASE
   CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 7, PARAGRAPH 1,
           AND ISSUES TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT

23. The initial characterization of the projects in question was clearly
 issue when this dispute between Argentina and Uruguay began, but it
 no longer so in the present proceedings, because, as stated in para-
aph 96 of the Judgment, the Parties are agreed in considering that the
o planned mills (the CMB (ENCE) and Orion (Botnia) mills) are
anned works of sufficient importance (“entidad suficiente”) to fall
thin the scope of Article 7, paragraph 1, of the 1975 Statute, and that,
erefore, in principle, CARU should have been informed of them in
cordance with that provision.

24. Furthermore, both Parties acknowledge : (1) that CARU is with-
 t power to approve the projects subject to Article 7 of the Statute and
 which it is informed by the Party planning the project ; and (2) that the
 es under Article 7, like all of the Statute’s other rules on the “prior
nsultation” process, do not constitute jus cogens, and that, therefore,
e Parties are free not to apply them in a given case.

 II. STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE AT WHICH URUGUAY WAS OBLIGED TO
 NFORM CARU ABOUT THE WORKS IT WAS PLANNING TO CARRY OUT


26. Determining the stage or point at which the State planning a work
obliged to inform CARU raises a question of the interpretation of
 ticle 7, paragraph 1, because the text of the provision does not specify
 s. Should CARU be informed “during the planning phase of the
oject” ? Or, “after this stage but before authorization is given to carry
t the planned construction activity” ? And, in the case of the first
pothesis, before or after an initial environmental authorization, known
 Uruguayan law as “Autorización Ambiental Previa (AAP)”, has been
anted by the territorial State ?

 27. According to the Judgment, the obligation of the State planning
tivities referred to in Article 7 of the Statute to inform CARU “will
come applicable at the stage when the relevant authority has had the
oject referred to it with the aim of obtaining initial environmental
 thorization and before the granting of that authorization” (para. 105).
  o not agree with the majority’s conclusion, because it refers to a stage
o early in the planning process. This, in turn, may in part be explained
  an institutional understanding of CARU, with which I also disagree,
 d by the link the Judgment makes between the obligation to inform
ARU, laid down by Article 7, paragraph 1, of the 1975 Statute of the
 ver Uruguay, and the principle of prevention, which, as a customary
 e, is now part of the corpus of substantive rules of international environ-
ental law. However, this finding introduces limitations on the State’s
 ritorial sovereignty during the planning phase of an industrial project,
hich go well beyond those which are explicit in Article 7 of the Statute
  by necessity underlie the text. This may be explained by the shared
volutionary” intent that the majority attributes to the Parties on this
 int, of which there is no evidence at all either in Article 7 or in any of
e other procedural rules making up the “prior consultation process” of
e 1975 Statute, that is to say, that this is based on a presumption. How-
er, as stated earlier in paragraph 13, limitations on a State’s territorial
vereignty are not to be presumed.

I believe that the adoption of methods characteristic of “evolutionary”
 erpretation is not justified in the present context quite simply because
e wording of the provisions laying down the “prior consultation pro-
ss” of the 1975 Statute, including therefore Article 7, does not directly
 indirectly permit the interpreter to do so. In fact, by adopting such
 thods, the majority’s recourse to the “relevant rules of international law
plicable in the relations between the parties” (Art. 31, para. 3 (c), of


e Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties) is not aimed at determin-
g the stage or point at which the territorial State is obliged to inform
ARU pursuant to the obligation set forth in Article 7, paragraph 1, of
e Statute, but at determining the best time to do so from the point of
 w of applying the customary principle of prevention under interna-
 nal environmental law.

 As a result, the role of the “relevant rules of international law appli-
ble in the relations between the parties” in the interpretation process is
verted. Instead of having recourse to the customary law as one of
veral elements in determining the meaning and scope of Article 7,
 ragraph 1, of the 1975 Statute, the treaty provision is assigned the task of
  isfying the requirements of the application of the customary principle
  prevention. Consequently, the text, the context and the subsequent
 reements or practice become trivial elements in the interpretation pro-
ss of Article 7 of the Statute, which in effect is aimed at extending the
 plication of the customary obligation of prevention (which derives
om a substantive rule) to the procedural rules of the “prior consultation
ocess” of the Statute of the River Uruguay. Moreover, I strongly fear
at the decided outcome will become an additional source of difficulty
r one or both of the Parties in the future.

 t the consent of the other Party, with the regrettable result that one
 rty may be obliged to inform CARU of its plans earlier than the other.
owever, I do not believe that such intent can be attributed to the draft-
  of the 1975 Statute of the River Uruguay.

 31. My position on this issue is based on the text of Article 7, para-
aph 1, and on Article 28 of the Statute, as well as on the object and
 rpose of informing CARU, on the relevant provisions of the CARU
 gest elaborating on the Statute (Subject E.3, title 2, Chap. 3, Sec. 1,
 t. 2 and Chap. 1, Sec. 1, Art. 1 (a)) and on the practice of the Parties
 CARU in such cases as the Transpapel mill, the M’Bopicua port, the
 tnia port and the Nueva Palmira freight terminal. These interpretative
 ments do not endorse the theory that informing CARU for the
 rposes of Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Statute must precede “any
 thorization”.
 32. It is clear from the wording of the Article that the obligation to
 orm is tied to the “carrying out” of the planned “work” (the authentic
 anish text is unambiguous: “La Parte que proyecte la construcción de
 evos canales . . . o la realización de cualesquiera otras obras . . .”). That
e State is only planning the “work” is not sufficient for the obligation
 inform CARU to become applicable. According to the text of the pro-
 ion, the State must also be “planning the carrying out of the work”,
cause it is only during the carrying out or implementation of the plan
at activities or works relating thereto could affect the navigation, the
gime of the river or the quality of its waters and thereby cause signifi-
nt damage to the other State, since the river is a shared natural
 ource.
 33. It is also essential not to lose sight of the fact that the object and
 rpose of informing CARU, pursuant to Article 7, paragraph 1, of the
atute, is simply to allow the Commission to determine on a preliminary
 sis within thirty days whether the project is liable to affect the naviga-
 n, the régime of the river or the quality of its waters and thereby cause
 nificant damage to the other State. This refers to activities or works
hich could cause damage of a physical nature to the river or its waters.
  e mere granting by a public administrative body of an “authorization”
not an act or an activity which is likely to cause such effects.

34. In the present case, Argentina does not claim to have suffered any
nificant damage solely as a result of Uruguay granting the AAPs for


e CMB (ENCE) or Orion Botnia mills, or as a result of the “prelimi-
 ry works” to the construction of the mills which Uruguay authorized.
   the start of the case, Argentina spoke of “risks”, because at the
me there had been no construction works. In the oral phase, the
pposed significant damage did not for the most part relate to the
onstruction” works, preliminary or otherwise, of the Orion (Botnia)
 ll, but rather to the negative effects on the river and its waters of the
 ll’s “operation”, that is, the effects of its commissioning from
November 2007 onwards.

35. In light of the foregoing, I consider that, where the text of Arti-
  7, paragraph 1, is silent, the issue should be resolved by the interpreter
  looking to the rule of general international law (Art. 31, para. 3 (c),
 the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). And what does inter-
tional law have to say on the matter ? It says that the information must
  “timely” (“en temps utile”) or communicated “in a timely manner”
opportun”) (see, for example, Art. 12 of the 1997 Convention on the
 w of the Non-Navigational Uses of Watercourses).

36. Applied to Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Statute, this simply
eans that the State must inform CARU sufficiently in advance of the
ain aspects of the work, how it is to be carried out and the other tech-
cal data on the project (Art. 7, para. 3), in order to enable the proce-
 res provided for in Articles 7 to 12 to be carried out as laid down by
e Statute.
37. In any case, logically, Article 7, first paragraph, has meaning only
 construed as requiring that the information be communicated at a
 ge when solid technical information is available on the project, but
fore the project is so far advanced in its construction that any assess-
ent of the potential damage from the industrial facility would come too
 e to offer any remedy, which would undoubtedly be contrary to that
ovision of the Statute.


                                    *
 38. As stated earlier, a Uruguayan AAP is a necessary but by no
eans sufficient authorization for its holder to carry out construction
orks or commissioning activities. In the case of ENCE, the company
 tained its AAP on 9 October 2003 and had only carried out ground-
 aring works before the project was abandoned in 2006 ; and in that of
 tnia, after its AAP of 14 February 2005, the company also carried out
her preparatory works (such as constructing the concrete foundations
 d the plant’s chimney) before Uruguay granted it the authorizations to
 ild the actual mill ; these were followed much later by the authorization
 commission the mill. The case of Botnia is telling in this respect : con-
 uction works for the mill did not begin until approximately one year


 er its AAP of 14 February 2005. Moreover, between that AAP and the
mmissioning of the mill on 9 November 2007, the company received
e following approvals :

  on 12 April 2005, of its Environmental Management Plan (“PGA” in
  Spanish) for the removal of vegetation and earth moving ;

  on 22 August 2005, of its PGA for the construction of concrete foun-
  dations and the chimney ;
  on 18 January 2006, of its PGA for the construction phase of the
  works ;
  on 10 May 2006, of its PGA for the construction of the wastewater
  treatment plant ;
  on 9 April 2007, of its PGA for the creation of an industrial non-
  hazardous waste landfill ;
  on 9 April 2007, of its PGA for the construction of a solid industrial
  waste landfill ;
  on 31 October 2007, of its PGA for operations ;
  on 8 November 2007, of the actual operation of the plant (Uruguay’s
  Rejoinder, para. 2.48, CR 2009/22, p. 13).
39. It follows that on the date of conclusion of the agreements which
ll be examined below, (the “understanding” between the Ministers for
 reign Affairs (Bielsa-Opertti) of 2 March 2004 and the agreement
 ablishing the GTAN between the Presidents (Kirchner-Vázquez) of
May 2005, both of which, in my view, render the provision set forth in
 ticle 7, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the River Uruguay inapplicable
 this case) the respective time-limits for informing CARU timely or in a
mely manner about the implementation of the CMB (ENCE) mill
oject and the Orion (Botnia) mill project had not expired, as Uruguay
ll had the opportunity to do this in a timely or appropriate manner for
e purposes of the aims to be achieved through the information process.
40. Therefore, on the date of the agreements, Uruguay could not have
eached the obligation to inform CARU under Article 7, paragraph 1,
 the Statute, because “[a]n act of a State does not constitute a breach of
  international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in
 estion at the time the act occurs” and “[t]he breach of an international
 ligation by an act of a State not having continuing character occurs at
e moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue”
 rt. 13 and Art. 14, para. 1, Articles on Responsibility of States for
ternationally Wrongful Acts).
41. There was, therefore, no “wrongful delay” by Uruguay in respect
 the obligation to inform CARU under Article 7, paragraph 1, of the
atute of the River Uruguay before the conclusion of the above-
entioned subsequent agreements between the Parties. I would add that
e Parties are agreed that the acts amounting to any procedural breaches
volving Articles 7 to 12 of the Statute are to be categorized as being


nstantaneous” in nature (Argentina’s Memorial, paras. 8.12 et seq.;
R 2009/19, p. 45, para. 3).


   IV. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENTS OF

 42. In the case of both ENCE and Botnia, the Parties jointly decided
 dispense with the preliminary review by CARU provided for in Arti-
  7 of the Statute and to proceed immediately to the direct consulta-
 ns and negotiations referred to in Article 12. In both cases, Argentina
 s the Party which sought to hold direct consultations with Uruguay at
mes when CARU did not offer a viable framework, either because the
ommission had halted its sessions, or because it was deadlocked.

43. As the rules laid out in Articles 7 to 12 of the Statute of the River
 uguay are not peremptory norms (jus cogens), there is nothing to pre-
nt the Parties from deciding by “joint agreement” to proceed immedi-
ely to direct consultation or negotiations without having to adhere to
e procedures under the Statute. And that is precisely what they did.
 is “joint agreement” does indeed exist : it is manifest in the two above-
entioned agreements which Uruguay invoked in the present proceed-
gs and which Argentina has acknowledged exist, although it disputes
e content and the scope which Uruguay affords them.
44. The Judgment recognizes that there is an “understanding” (Bielsa-
pertti agreement) and an “agreement” (Presidents’ agreement establish-
g the GTAN) which are binding on the Parties since they have entered
 o them (paras. 128 and 138 of the Judgment), but rejects that in the
esent case their effect was to depart from the Statute’s procedures
 rts. 7-12). For the reasons set out below, I disagree with this.

   1. The Understanding of 2 March 2004 between the Ministers
                       for Foreign Affairs
45. On 9 October 2003, at a meeting between Presidents Kirchner
 rgentina) and Battle (Uruguay) in Anchorena, (Colonia, Uruguay), the
bject of the paper pulp mills in Fray Bentos appears to have come up.
 t nowhere in the material submitted to the Court is there any reference
 the Presidents’ conversations on the subject. However, the Ministers
r Foreign Affairs, Messrs. Bielsa (Argentina) and Opertti (Uruguay),
d refer to the “M’Bopicuá Plant” at a press conference of which a tran-
 ipt does appear in the record. Minister Bielsa said :
      “We talked about the M’Bopicuá plant. The idea is that when the
   company issues its environmental assessment plan, that report can
   be made known. From the point of view of Argentina, if the report
   is satisfactory regarding the environmental issues, something that
   Uruguay is also pursuing in its capacity as the sixth leading nation in


   the world in terms of environmental protection, then we shall be in
   agreement.
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
     The position of the two nations is absolutely in harmony [sic].
   We . . . want to see that this plant is actually installed, that these jobs
   can actually be created, that the investment can actually go forward
   and that this does not involve any deterioration for the environ-
   ment.” (Uruguay’s Counter-Memorial, Vol. II, Ann. 14.)

nd Minister Opertti (Uruguay) said :
       “La opinión oficial del Gobierno es muy sencilla y muy clara : esto
   se trata de una inversión en territorio uruguayo sujeta a ley uru-
   guaya. Naturalmente que es una inversión importante y si de esa
   inversión pudieren directa o indirectamente derivar efectos que pudi-
   eran de alguna manera poner en riesgo valores ambientales, que
   tanto la Argentina como el Uruguay defienden porque los dos ten-
   emos el mismo credo en esa materia, naturalmente que los dos tra-
   taremos de evitar que eso suceda. Y para ello ya existen mecanismos
   . . . hay una Comisión Administradora del Río Uruguay y a ella lle-
   garemos si es preciso.” 2 (Ibid.)
46. But, also on 9 October 2003, MVOTMA (Ministerio de Vivienda
 denamiento Territorial y Medio Ambiente) granted the AAP to ENCE
Gabenir S.A.” at the time) for the “Celulosa de M’Bopicuá” (CMB)
 per pulp mill on the left bank of the River Uruguay at Fray Bentos,
ar the international bridge and opposite the Argentine region of Guale-
 aychú, where the population had demonstrated against the building of
e plant. Argentina considered this a breach of Article 7 of the Statute
 the River Uruguay and protested against the granting of that AAP to
NCE, notably by ceasing to attend CARU meetings (that situation con-
 ued until the conclusion of the agreement of 2 March 2004).

47. The Parties, however, continued their discussions on the CMB
NCE) project at a higher level — through ministers and Ministers for
 reign Affairs —, in other words, outside CARU, whose work had
me to a halt. Thus, by a diplomatic Note dated 27 October 2003, for
ample, Uruguay’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs transmitted to Argentina :
  the environmental impact assessment for ENCE ; (2) DINAMA’s

  “The Government’s official position is very simple and very clear : this is an invest-
  ment on Uruguayan territory, subject to Uruguayan law. It is, of course, a substan-
  tial investment and, were there a risk of this investment, directly or indirectly, in any
  way jeopardizing the environmental values to which both Argentina and Uruguay
  subscribe — our approaches being the same in that respect — both countries would
  naturally endeavour to prevent such a risk from materializing. Mechanisms to that
  end are already in place . . . there is an Administrative Commission of the River Uru-
  guay, to which we could turn should the need arise.”

   information relative to the construction of the plant, and in regard
   to the operational phase, instruct the CARU to proceed to carry out
   a monitoring of the water quality of the Uruguay River in conform-
   ity with the provisions of the Statute for the River Uruguay, espe-
   cially its Chapter X, Articles 40 to 43. This decision coincides with
   the request of the Governor of Entre Ríos Province . . . The under-
   standing of the Foreign Ministers, the note from the Governor of
   Entre Ríos and the report of the technical experts coincide in that
   the CARU should concentrate its activity on the subject of mecha-
   nisms of control.” [Translation by the Registry.] (Uruguay’s Rejoin-
   der, Vol. II, Ann. R14, p. 617.)
59. The statement by the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a
port presented to the Chamber of Deputies for 2004 reads as follows :

      “In June of that same year [2004], a Bilateral Agreement was
   signed through which Argentina’s Government put an end to the
   controversy.
      Said agreement respects, on the one hand, the Uruguayan national
   character of the project, and on the other hand, the regulations in
   force that regulate the waters of the Uruguay River through the
   CARU.


     Likewise, it includes a work methodology for the three phases of
  construction of the project : the project, the construction and the
  operation.
     Thus, inclusive control procedures were carried out on the Uruguay
  River which means they will continue after the plants are in opera-
  tion.
     Controls on both plants will be more extensive than those our own
  country has on its plants on the Paraná River, which were neverthe-
  less accepted by Uruguay (the technologies that the province of
  Entre Ríos questions Uruguay about are the same ones that are used
  in our country).” (Uruguay’s Counter-Memorial, Vol. III, Ann. 46 ;
  emphasis added.)

60. According to the statement made in Argentina’s 2004 Annual
port on the State of the Nation prepared by the Head of the Argentine
binet Office (dated 1 March 2005) :
     “That same month [i.e., June 2004 (sic)], both countries signed a
  bilateral agreement which put an end to the controversy over the
  pulp mill installation in Fray Bentos.
     This agreement respects, on the one hand, the Uruguayan and
  national character of the work, which was never under discussion,
  and on the other hand, the regulation in force that regulates the
  Uruguay River waters through the CARU.
     It also provides for a working procedure for the three phases of
  construction of the work : project, construction and operation.”
  (Ibid., Vol. III, Ann. 48, p. 28.)
adds further on :
     “In view of the ‘specific agreements of both Delegations at CARU’
  regarding the possible installation of pulp mill plants on the Uruguay
  River bank, a ‘Monitoring Plan for Environmental Quality of the
  Uruguay River in the Areas of the Pulp Mill Plants’ was designed,

 gentina’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bielsa, expressly proposed
 ect discussions on the two mills (ENCE and Botnia) to his Uruguayan
unterpart, Mr. Gargano (Uruguay’s Rejoinder, Vol. II, Ann. R15). It
 s thus once again Argentina which suggested that the issue of the
