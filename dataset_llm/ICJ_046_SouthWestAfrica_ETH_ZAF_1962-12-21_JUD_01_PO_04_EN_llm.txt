I agree generally with the reasons given in the Judgment of the
Court, but I feel that a great deal of the argument on the first three
Preliminary Objections in the Judgment goes to the merit of the
case. The Court is concerned essentially at this stage with the
question of jurisdiction. The way in which the claims of the Appli-
cants and the Preliminary Objections of the Respondent are framed
make it difficult for the Court to avoid touching on the merits of the
case. But that notwithstanding, I feel that emphasis should be on a
line of reasoning that deals essentially with the issue of jurisdiction;
and the opinion which I now give is intended to supplement the
reasoning of the Court on the First, Second and Third Preliminary
Objections.

In dealing with the issue of jurisdiction, I think it would be
better to begin with the position as it was before the dissolution of
the League. The first question that leaps to the mind then is would
the Permanent Court of International Justice have had jurisdiction
in the matter now before the Court? If it would, then by Article 37
of the Statute of the International Court of Justice that jurisdiction



would have been transferred to this Court, assuming that the
Mandate with Article 7 is still in force.

The competence of the Permanent Court of International Justice
is provided for in Article 36 of the Statute of that Court, the first
paragraph of which reads as follows:

“The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all cases which the
parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in treaties
and conventions in force.”

The Permanent Court would have had jurisdiction if the Mandate
which contains Article 7 on which the Applicants base their right to
come to Court was a treaty or convention in force. The Respondent
says in its final submission that the Mandate was never a treaty or
convention and that if it ever was a treaty or convention, it is,
since the dissolution of the League, no longer in force. I agree with
the Court that the Mandate is and has always been a treaty or
convention in force and I shall explain how I came to that conclu-
sion later. Assuming, therefore, that the Mandate was a treaty or
convention in force, when the Permanent Court of International
Justice was abolished, Article 37 transferred to this Court the juris-
diction which the Permanent Court had or would have had under
Article 7 of the Mandate.

Treaty or convention in force

In his submission, Respondent says with respect to the First
Objection, that the Mandate for South West Africa has never been,
or, at any rate, is, since the dissolution of the League of Nations,
no longer, a “treaty or convention in force” within the meaning of
Article 37 of the Statute of the Court. The submission is advanced
with respect to the Mandate Agreement as a whole, including
Article 7 thereof, and, in any event, with respect to Article 7 itself.

The first part of the submission, namely, that the Mandate
Agreement was never a ‘‘treaty or convention in force”, was based
on a review of the history of the creation of the Mandate as given on
behalf of the Respondent in answer to certain questions posed by a
Member of the Court, in particular questions Nos. 3 and 4 which
read as follows:

“Question 3: Does any party to these proceedings claim that
the Declaration by the Council (Annex B) is in itself a treaty or
convention?”

“Question 4: ... A. Who in 1920 were the parties to any treaty or

convention by virtue of which the Mandate was conferred upon the
Respondent upon the terms or provisions set out in the Declaration?

B. If States, Members of the League, were parties to such treaty

or convention:

(1) Was the treaty or convention registered under the provisions
of Article 18 of the Covenant and the machinery for registration
established by the League? If so, by whom was it registered
and to whom was the certificate of registration issued?

(2) If not registered, what significance, if any, is to be attached
to the fact of non-registration?”

The Respondent said in its reply that the Declaration was not
in itself a treaty or convention : because it was called a “declaration”
and not a treaty or convention, was never signed by the Man-
datory, had no provision for ratification, was never ratified and



was never registered. It, however, added in answer to question A
that if the Mandate was a treaty or convention, the Parties were the
Mandatory on the one hand, and the League and/or its Members as
such, on the other.

Until the questions were put, the Respondent had proceeded on
the basis that the Mandate Declaration was a treaty or convention.
That the Mandate Declaration is a treaty or convention [within
the meaning of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court] is supported
strongly by the past history of the Mandate. If the Mandate
Declaration was never a treaty, by what right then did the Respond-
ent assume the administration of the territory? For upwards of
40 years it has administered the territory because it regarded the
Declaration as a treaty or convention empowering it to do so on
the terms therein set out. If the law of estoppel has any meaning
or application in international law the Respondent would be pre-
cluded from raising such an issue on the face of its own conduct
during the past 40 years. In the Eastern Greenland case (1933,
Series A/B, p. 51) the Permanent Court of International Justice

said at page 68:

“In accepting these bilateral and multilateral agreements as
binding upon herself, Norway reaffirmed that she récognized the
whole of Greenland as Danish; and thereby she has debarred herself
from contesting Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland
and in consequence from proceeding to occupy it.”

It is significant, if there is any substance in the point, that the
Respondent had not raised it earlier either in any of the previous
proceedings on the various advisory opinions on the Mandate
requested of the Court by the General Assembly of the United
Nations, or in the proceedings of the various organs of the United
Nations.

This Court in the 1950 Advisory Opinion on the Status of South
West Africa held after careful consideration that the Mandate was
a treaty or convention in force. In the Mavrommatis Palestine
Concessions case (P.C.1.J. Series A, No. 2, p. 7), the Permanent
Court of International Justice regarded the Palestine Mandate
created in a similar manner as the Mandate for South West Africa
as a treaty or convention creating rights and obligations recognized
by international law, and based jurisdiction on Article 26 of that
Mandate, which is identical to Article 7 of the Mandate for South
West Africa.

This Court, in its Advisory Opinion in the South West Africa
case in 1950, held—as I have already stated—that the Mandate
survived the League and is still in force. The Respondent has not
quarrelled seriously with that finding of the Court. Indeed, it says
in its oral submissions, through its Agent, Dr. verLoren van The-
maat (page 4 of oral proceedings):

“We state that our submissions under the First jection concern
only the Mandate as an agreement, our contention being that as a
treaty or convention the Mandate is no longer in force. We state
further that no submissions are advanced about the question whether
the Mandate in the wider sense of being an institution survived the



S. W. AFRICA CASES (SEP. OP. SIR LOUIS MBANEFO)

League or not. The logical effect of this attitude is that, although we
make no admissions in that regard, we are prepared for the purposes
of our argument in these Objections to assume that the Mandate as
an institution survived the League.”

Later, at pages 16 and 17, Mr. de Villiers in his oral submissions on
behalf of the Respondent, also states:

“e

. although we contend that the Mandate, seen as a treaty or
convention, has lapsed, we do not offer any argument to the Court
on the question, the wider question, whether the Mandate, seen as
an objective institution, is still in force, and if so, to what extent...
It is therefore common cause between us and the Applicants that,
for purposes of the argument, at least the substantive obligations as
originally set out in clauses 2-5 of the Mandate must be regarded as
still being in force.”

In his Submission on the Third Preliminary Objection the Respon-
dent says that the conflict or disagreement alleged by the Ap-
plicants to exist between them and the Respondent is by reason
of its nature and content not a “dispute” as envisaged in Article 7
of the Mandate for South West Africa and more particularly in
that no material interests of the Applicants or of their nationals
are involved therein or affected thereby.

Respondent’s argument proceeded on the assumption that,
despite the dissolution of the League, Applicants would still be
entitled to invoke the provisions of Article 7 of the Mandate for
South West Africa in an appropriate case. The burden of his ar-
gument is that there is a qualification inherent in the meaning
of the word “dispute” in a compulsory jurisdiction clause, such as
Article 7, and that is “a confining of the subject-matter in dispute
to something in which the Applicants have legal rights or interests”.
He says that the dispute in the instant case does not affect any
material interests of the Applicant States or their nationals.

In construing the word “dispute” in Article 7, one should first
look at the word in the light of its ordinary and natural meaning.
The material part of Article 7, for the purpose of this Preliminary
Objection, reads as follows:

“The Mandatory agrees that if any dispute whatever should
arise between the Mandatory and another Member of the League
relating to the interpretation or the application of the provisions
of the Mandate...”

It is not contended that the dispute, whatever it is, does not
relate to the interpretation or the application of the provisions of
the Mandate. Respondent’s Counsel concedes that it does. Indeed,
he says in his oral submission:

“Our contention is not concerned with the question whether the
subject-matter of the dispute falls within the category interpre-



tation or application of the Mandate. We assume for the purposes
of argument that it does so fall.”

Unless the context otherwise dictates, or there is some express
provision to the contrary, the term “dispute” must be given its
ordinary and natural meaning. In the context in which the word
appears in Article 7, no such inherent qualification as Respondent’s
Counsel contends can legitimately be implied or read into it. In
its Advisory Opinion on Interpretation of Peace Treaties with
Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania in 1950, this Court held, at page 74,
that “where there has arisen a situation in which the two sides
hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the perfor-
mance or non-performance of certain treaty obligations, the Court
must conclude that international disputes have arisen’; and in its
Judgment in the Asylum case between Colombia and Peru, No-
vember 1050, the Court said that “a dispute requires a divergence
of views between the parties on definite points”. In the Mavrom-
matis case the Permanent Court of International Justice, in dealing
with Article 26 of the Mandate for Palestine, which is an identical
clause to Article 7 of the Mandate for South West Africa, defines
“dispute” as a ‘“‘disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict
of legal views or of interests between two persons’.

Respondent’s Counsel tound himself in some difficulty when he
came to define “interest”. He said that it must be material interest.
The Court cannot decide whether a dispute affects the material
interest of an applicant without going into the evidence. An appli-
cant is not limited to showing that its interest, be it material or
not, has been affected; it is also entitled to show that the course
of action pursued or threatened is likely to affect its interest or
those of its nationals adversely.

But an applicant does not have to do that under Article 7 once it
is shown that the parties hold clearly opposing views on a question
of law of fact. In this respect the view of the Agent for the British
Government in the Mavrommatis case is noteworthy. In the preli-
minary counter-case in the Mavrommatis case (Series C, No. 5-1,
page 445) he states:

“The concessions granted to Mr. Rutenberg in September 1921
for the development of electrical energy and water-power in Palestine
were obliged to conform to this Article 11, and it would have been
open to any Member of the League to question provisions in those
concessions which infringed the international obligations which His
Britannic Majesty as Mandatory for Palestine had accepted.”

Article 7 speaks of “any dispute whatever”. That phrase throws
the net as wide as possible. The framers of the Article could not



be thinking only of disputes where the right or material interest of
a State or its nationals was concerned. The inhabitants of the
mandated territory of South West Africa could not themselves—
either individually or collectively-—under the Court’s Statute or
Rules bring an action to the Permanent Court, nor could the League,
so that when the Mandate speaks of ‘any dispute whatever between
the Mandatory and another Member of the League”, vis-à-vis
the Mandate, the authors of the Mandate Agreement must have
intended that any breach of its obligations by the Mandatory, if
it could not be settled by negotiation, should be the subject-matter
of an action in a contentious proceeding under the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court. In the Mavrommatis case the Permanent
Court said, at page 15: “The dispute may be of any nature; the
language of the article in this respect is as comprehensive as
possible.”

I do not therefore find any substance in the submission of Re-
spondent that the word “dispute” should be given a restricted
meaning by confining it to disputes in which the material interests
of the Applicants are involved. Further, I am of the view that,
even if any such interest is required to sustain an action under
Article 7, absence of such interest may be a ground for refusing a
claim but not for denying jurisdiction and, in any event, the
Applicants as has been shown in the Judgment of the Court have
such interest in ensuring that the Mandatory carry out its int~rna-
* tional obligations under the Mandate.

I agree with the Judgment of the Court that the Mandate is a
treaty or convention in force and that Article 7 of the Mandate
Declaration is still in force. I also agree with the conclusion reached
by the Court that the Third and Fourth Preliminary Objections
are not well founded. It follows therefore that Applicants as parties
to the Statute of this Court have the right by virtue of Articles 36
and 37 of the Statute of the Court to invoke the compulsory juris-
diction of the Court in the instant proceedings.
