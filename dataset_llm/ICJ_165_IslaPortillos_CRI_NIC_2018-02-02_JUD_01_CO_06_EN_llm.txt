   7. According to paragraph 2 of Article 102, “[n]o party to any such
treaty or international agreement which has not been registered . . . may
invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations”.
The International Court of Justice being, according to Article 92 of the
United Nations Charter, “the principal judicial organ of the United
Nations”, it follows that such unregistered treaties cannot be invoked
before it 1. This does not, however, as the Court has observed, “have any
consequence for the actual validity of the agreement, which remains no
less binding upon the parties” (Maritime Delimitation and Territorial
Questions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Jurisdiction and
Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 122, para. 29).
   8. The concept of “invocation” has been taken, in the context of Arti-
cle 102 of the Charter, to mean that “a party relies upon a treaty as the
foundation of its claim or counter-claim, or where the particular legal
right that it alleges has been infringed has its basis in the terms thereof” 2.
In this case, it does not appear that Costa Rica has attempted to so invoke
the 1980 Treaty.
   9. For its part, Nicaragua did appear to rely on the 1980 Treaty to
establish, at least indirectly, that Costa Rica had renounced certain
maritime entitlements to its beneﬁt (see Judgment, paras. 124-134). How-
ever, it is not necessary in the present case to determine whether Nicara-
gua has “invoked’” the 1980 Treaty within the meaning of Article 102,
paragraph 2, given that Nicaragua is not a party to that Treaty and there-
fore does not fall within the scope of Article 102, paragraph 2, in respect
of it 3.

   10. Notwithstanding that neither Party was thus probably captured by
the terms of Article 102, paragraph 2, of the Charter in this case, that
provision is, as a whole, an important element in maintaining the inter-
national rule of law 4 and States should respect their obligations there-
under. It is therefore disappointing that the parties to the 1980 Treaty
appear to have treated their obligations under Article 102 of the Charter
in a somewhat cavalier fashion and that the Court did not take the oppor-
tunity to acknowledge this in its Judgment.
