T agree with the decision of the Court that it has jurisdiction
to hear the present cases on the merits and that the four preliminary
objections are not well founded and should be dismissed. Since,
however, the Opinion of the Court does not embrace all the questions
of fact and of law which I find essential to reaching the decision, I
find it my duty to deliver this separate Opinion.

The nature of the international obligations assumed by a Man-
datory in accepting a Mandate, and specifically, the nature of those
obligations assumed by the Respondent in accepting the Mandate
for South West Africa, is a focal point in the decision of the juris-
dictional issues in these cases. In my view, it is not possible to
understand the nature of those obligations without a thorough
appreciation of the principal facts prefacing and attending the
finalization of the Mandate. These facts, as now available in pub-
lished official records, have hitherto not been adequately presented.
Accordingly, without repeating much that is familiar in the history
of the Mandates, I shall summarize and comment on those facts
which seem to me to be essential to an analysis of the obligations
of the Mandatory for South West Africa.

On 7 May 1910, at a meeting of the Council of Four {President
Wilson, Mr. Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau and Sr. Orlando), Mr.
Lloyd George submitted a proposal for the allocation of the Man-
dates, including the allocation of the Mandate for South West
Africa to Great Britain acting on behalf of the Union of South
Africa. At the afternoon meeting on the same day, a “decision”
was taken approving these proposals and the decision was published.

On 27 June the Council of Four, with Japan also represented,
had before it “forms” of the Mandates which had been prepared
by Lord Milner and submitted by Mr. Lloyd George. The details
were not discussed and after some general observations the Council
decided to set up a Commission under Lord Milner to prepare
drafts of the Mandates.

On the following day the Milner Commission met in Paris
and Lord Milner submitted a draft to serve as a pattern for the
C Mandates. This draft contained no provision for reference to
the Permanent Court of International Justice.

On 5 July a joint British-French draft to serve as a pattern for
B Mandates was laid before the Milner Commission. This draft also
contained no provision for reference to the International Court.

On 8 July the British-French draft was taken as a basis for
discussion but the United States representative submitted an



alternative draft for B Mandates. This draft contained two para-
graphs concerning references to the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice. These provisions read as follows (translation) :

“Article 15

If a dispute should arise between the Members of the League of
Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the
present Convention and if this dispute cannot be settled by ne-
gotiation, it will be referred to the Permanent Court of International
Justice which is to be established by the League of Nations.

The subjects or citizens of States Members of the League of Nations
may likewise bring claims concerning infractions of the rights
conferred on them by Articles 5, 6, 7, 7a and 7b of this Mandate
before the said Court for decision. The judgment rendered by this
Court will be without appeal in both the preceding cases and will
have the same effect as an arbitral decision rendered according to
Article 13 of the Covenant.”

It will be noted that the italicized words in the first paragraph
indicate that either the Mandatory or another Member of the
League, could invoke the jurisdiction of the Court. This provision
was subsequently altered.

The representative of France and Lord Milner both said that
they had no objection to the principle of recourse to the inter-
national Court but they both objected to the provision in the second ‘
paragraph which would allow individuals to invoke the jurisdiction
of the Court. The representative of the United States then agreed
to a modification suggested by Lord Robert Cecil by which the
second paragraph would read as follows:

“The Members of the League of Nations may likewise, on behalf
of their subjects or citizens, bring claims for infractions of their
rights...”

It was also agreed to delete the references to the specific Articles
in this same second paragraph. These amendments were agreed to
in the meeting of 9 July.

On the following day, 10 July, a draft to serve as a pattern
for C Mandates was approved with a paragraph concerning reference
to the Court which was identical with the first paragraph of the
United States draft which has just been discussed. At the same
meeting the Commission also approved a draft to serve as a pattern
for B Mandates and this draft contained the fwo paragraphs as
proposed by the United States but with the amendments which
have been indicated.

On 15 July Lord Milner sent these drafts for B and C Mandates
to the Secretary-General of the Peace Conference in Paris and on
5 August he and Colonel House announced at a session of the
Commission in London that President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George
had approved both drafts. In the Commission, the French re-



presentative then made a reservation concerning the recruitment
of troops in B Mandates and the Japanese representative made a
reservation concerning the Open Door in C Mandates. The Com-
mission decided to send the drafts formally to the Council of the
Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris. The Commission
on Mandates did not meet again after this date but the texts of
the drafts for B and C Mandates which they had approved were
sent to the legal experts of the Drafting Committee of the Peace
Conference, who, without discussing the substance of the drafts,
put them into the form of formal conventions.

On 24 December 1919, the Council of Heads of Delegations in
Paris considered the “‘drafts of Conventions relative to Mandates”
including one concerning the allocation to the British Empire
(Union of South Africa) for German South West Africa.

It was explained to the Council that these drafts were the texts
adopted by the Commission in London which had been put into
treaty form by the legal experts of the Drafting Committee. In the
draft Convention for South West Africa one finds in the listing of
the High Contracting Parties that His Majesty the King of the
United Kingdom, etc., is listed twice, the second time “for and on
behalf of His Union of South Africa”. Article 8 of this draft Con-
vention reads as follows:

“The consent of the Council of the League of Nations is required
for any modification of the terms of this Mandate. If any dispute
whatever should arise between the Members of the League of
Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of those
provisions which cannot be settled by negotiation, this dispute
shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice
to be established by the League of Nations.”

In this draft Convention, the provisions which later appear in the
Preamble of the Mandate were stated somewhat differently. The .
first paragraph of the Preamble of the draft Convention contains a
provision identical—except for a few stylistic differences—with the
first paragraph of the final text of the Preamble. Paragraph 2 is a
little different but refers to Article 22 of the Covenant and the
desire of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to confer a
Mandate upon His Britannic Majesty ‘to be exercised on His behalf
by the Government of the Union of South Africa’, and then recites
that they have decided to conclude a Convention. Article 1 of the
draft Convention then says the Powers “confer” the Mandate and
says that the Mandate will be exercised by the Union of South
Africa in conformity with Article 22 of the Covenant. By Article 2,
His Britannic Majesty accepts the Mandate “and will execute the
same on behalf of the League of Nations, and in accordance with
the following provisions”. This is the basis for paragraph 3 of the
Preamble of the final text.



At the end of the draft Convention is a sentence:

“Confirmed by the Council of the League of Nations the … dayof...”

At this time the United States Commission to the Peace Confer-
ence had already returned to the United States but the United
States was represented in the Council of Heads of Delegations. With
reference to the drafts of the ‘C’’ Mandates, it was decided that
discussion would be resumed after the Japanese delegate had
received instructions from his government concerning the “Open
Door” reservation. Japan did not disagree with the provision for
recourse to the Court.

The foregoing events all took place before the Treaty of Ver-
sailles, of which the Covenant of the League of Nations was a part,
entered into force on ro January 1920. On that date, the Mandate
for South West Africa had not been perfected. The allocation of the
Mandate to the Union of South Africa (represented by Great Britain)
had been agreed. Final agreement on the terms of the Mandate
awaited the final approval of Japan, but they had been drawn up
with Article 22 of the Covenant in mind. The Mandatory was party
to these agreements. The draft Convention contemplated confir-
mation by the Council of the League of Nations as the final link and
it is with the Council of the League that the final stages of perfecting
the Mandate are connected.

At this point the Mandatory was bound by an international ob-
ligation to France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, to accept the
Mandate for South West: Africa, to exercise it according to the
agreed terms, and to submit to the jurisdiction of the Permanent
Court disputes with other Members of the League concerning the
interpretation or application of the Mandate. This agreement was
subject to two conditions subsequent: (1) approval by Japan;
(2) confirmation by the Council of the League. Both of these
conditions were subsequently fulfilled and the international agree-
ment, with certain agreed amendments, was then perfected.

respective roles of the Council of the League on the one hand and
the Principal Allied Powers on the other. It will be recalled that
France, Great Britain, Japan and Belgium, namely the four States
which accepted Mandates—Great Britain acting in several capacities
—were at this time Members of the Council of the League. In

1. The decision of the Council of Four on 7 May, 1919, allocating
the Mandate for South West Africa to the Union of South Africa,
constituted the first link in what may be called the chain of title.
This “decision” was an international agreement between France,
Great Britain, Italy, the United States and the Union of South
Africa (represented by Great Britain} which had dispositive effect.
Japan subsequently concurred in or adhered to this agreement.

2. Since the allocation of a Mandate was not equivalent to a
cession of territory and did not transfer sovereignty to the Manda-
tory, it remained to determine what would be the rights and duties
of the Mandatory in its capacity as such. Article 22 of the Covenant,
by which all the States concerned were soon to be bound, indicated
the general nature of these rights and duties.

3. By 24 December 1919 agreement had been reached among
France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, on the one hand, and
the Union of South Africa represented by Great Britain, on the
other hand, on the terms of the Mandate, except for one unsettled
reservation of Japan. The agreed terms which were unaffected
by the Japanese reservation included a provision for the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

4. By December 1920 it had become clear that the United
States had disassociated itself from the Peace Treaty settlements
and from the League of Nations, which fact altered the form, but
not the fact of agreement on the terms of the Mandate for South
West Africa.

Paris, but in the form of a resolution of the Council of the League
of Nations. This draft began with a preamble of three paragraphs
substantially identical with the first three paraggraphs of the
Mandate as ultimately in force. These three paragraphs are then
followed by one line which reads:

“Hereby [the Council] approves the terms of the Mandate as
follows:

The text of Article 7 of this draft is:

“The consent of the Council of the League of Nations is required
for any modification of the terms of the present mandate, provided
that in the case of any modification proposed by the Mandatory
such consent may be given by a majority.

If any dispute whatever should arise between the Members of the

mandate, the Mandatory incurred international obligations of a
legal character and that it voluntarily agreed to incur those obliga-
tions; the obligations were certainly not imposed upon the Manda-
tory, which, under Article 22 (2) of the Covenant, was a State
“willing to accept” them. This béing the case, the next point to
consider is whether the agreement to incur these international
obligations of a legal character is to be characterized as a ‘“treaty
or convention”. The term “treaty or convention” is used in Arti-
cles 36 and 37 of the Statute, but since in recent times there has



been no justification for distinguishing in law between a treaty and
a convention, only the term “treaty” need be used here for purposes
of analysis.

Here again semantic difficulties are encountered, since, as €
Rapporteur of the International Law Commission has pointed out,
in all discussions in the law of treaties there is apt to be confusior
between the instrument in which an agreement is embodied and
the agreement itself. As far back as 1923, a sub-committee of
the League of Nations Committee on the Codification of Interna-
tional Law, referred to “the prevailing anarchy as regards termino-
logy” in the law of treaties. The notion that there is a clear and
ordinary meaning of the word “treaty” is a mirage. The fundamental
question is whether a State has given a promise or undertaking

expressed in a variety of forms may be identical with those re-
sulting from the most formal instruments. (Cf. Lissitzyn, “Efforts
to Codify or Restate the Law of Treaties”, 62 Columbia Law Review
1166 (1962).) In preparing draft codes on the law of treaties, rap-
porteurs have at times pointed out that the draft has for conven-
ience, been limited to apply, for example, only to treaties em-
bodied in written instruments. But the 1962 Report of the Inter-
national Law Commission, like that of 1959, emphasizes that the
fact that the articles do not apply to international agreements not in
written form ‘is not to deny the legal force of oral agreements
under international law”. The 1959 Report explained: “There may
be an international agreement, but there may be no instrument
embodying it—i.e., it is an oral agreement, made for example,
between heads of States or Governments...” (1959 Yearbook of the
International Law Commission, Vol. II, p. 94.)

The recent (1962) draft of the American Law Institute uses the
expression “international agreement” in place of “treaty” and
defines it as ‘‘an agreement between states or international or-
ganizations by which there is manifested an intention to create,
change or define relationships under international law”. The
comment says “there is no rule of international law which prevents
an oral agreement from constituting a binding international
agreement”.

essential quality or a perpetually imperative condition. The loss by
the French missionary in 1946 of the quality of being a national
of a “Member of the League” did not introduce any element of
frustration which would impede the performance of the Mandatory’s
obligation to permit his entry and residence. Granted the reasons

‘which have been suggested why there should have been granted
special rights to the Members in 1919, such reasons would not be
applicable in 1946; cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex. If the
Mandatory claimed the right to limit the privileges to missionaries
who were nationals of States which were Members of the League



when the League came to an end, the claim would be reasonable
and it would avoid any charge that there was imposed on the
Mandatory an obligation more onerous than that which it had
originally assumed.

Whether the presence of missionaries in the territory in question
was “‘essential” to the discharge of the “sacred trust” can scarcely
be determined by some objective test, subjectively conceived; per-
haps an answer could be given by taking evidence, but 1 leave
that aside. ’

If it be said that only such elements of the Mandates survived
as related to the welfare, etc., of the inhabitants, then the rights
of missionaries would be included in that group of provisions. The
rights of missionaries in the South West African Mandate are set
out in Article 5, which deals in general with freedom of conscience
and worship. Surely the Mandatory should not be privileged to
interfere with the religious life of the inhabitants by expelling mis-
sionaries on April 20 1946, on the technical ground that they no
longer qualified as nationals of a Member of the League. If this
stipulation pour autrui survived the dissolution of the League des-
pite the reference to a descriptive qualification which was no longer
applicable, other such stipulations could also have survived.

What then of Article 7—and for the purpose of the present
analysis one refers only to paragraph 2 of that Article? Again one
looks in vain for some established objective test to determine
whether in 1919 and 1920 possible reference to the Court was con-
sidered “essential” to the operation of the Mandate. One knows
that the provision was inserted in all the drafts from the outset
without any opposition to the fundamental principle, though there
were some drafting problems to which attention has been called.
In Mavrommatis, Lord Finlay said (at page 43) “it was highly
necessary that a Tribunal should be provided for the settlement
of such disputes’ as he thought might well arise under the Palestine
Mandate; he might have felt differently about C Mandates, but
the Court clause was in A, B and C Mandates as in all the minorities
treaties. Was there frustration, impossibility of performance
after 19 April 1946? Did Article 7 become inoperable? In contrast
to Article 6, where the organ—namely the Council of the League—
disappeared, in Article 7 a new organ had been substituted for
the old by the operation of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court
to which of course the Mandatory was a party. That transformation
took place on the birth of the United Nations, and there can be
no doubt.that Article 7 provided for reference to this Court during
that period from the birth of the United Nations to the death of the
League.

remains to be determined whether States who were beneficiaries of
the undertakings given by the Mandatory in the Mandate Agreement
obtained other rights in connection with the operation of the
Mandate as an institution or status, or in connection with the
operation of the Mandate as a treaty. This inquiry bears upon
Respondent’s contention that a “dispute” within the meaning of
Article 7 of the Mandate must involve a conflict concerning a legal
right or interest and not differences of opinion unconnected with
legal rights or interests. Without pausing to consider the basic
validity of this contention, I shall analyze the nature of the rights
or interests involved in the alleged “dispute” between Applicants
and Respondent.

It may be noted at once that Applicants assert that there is a
“dispute” with reference to Articles 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the Mandate
(Memorials, p. 62). This assertion does not refer to Article 5 which, as
noted above, is the only article in this particular Mandate which
contains a specification concerning the rights of nationals of States
other than the Mandatory. Hypothetically, provisions referring to
the “inhabitants” of the territory could refer to nationals of such
States if they happened to inhabit the territory, but no such situa-
tion has been presented here.

The jurisdictional provision in Article 7 can be invoked only if
there is a “dispute”. If there is a ‘‘dispute”’ it must further be shown
that it has two characteristics: first, it must be a dispute which
cannot be settled by negotiation; and second, it must relate to the
interpretation or application of the Mandate. Attention may be paid
first to the meaning of “dispute”. The identification of the other
party to the “dispute” will also be considered.

as the disputes relate to the question of the performance or non-
performance of the obligations provided in the articles dealing with
human rights and fundamental freedoms, they are clearly disputes
concerning the interpretation or execution of the Peace Treaties.”

However, it has in effect been contended that the allegations of
the Applicants bear no relation to Applicants’ legal rights and that |
the true meaning of the compromissory clause is that the “dispute”
must relate to the interpretation or application of those provisions
of the Mandate which vest certain legal rights in the Applicants,
such as, perhaps, the right under Article 5 for missionaries to enter
the territory. No such limitation is to be found in Article 7 which
refers to “any dispute whatever ... relating to the interpretation or
application of the provisions of the Mandate”. Since, however,
jurisdictional issues must be scrupulously explored, one may con-
sider whether it is to be presumed that the rights of other States
to dispute about the interpretation or application of the Mandates
were limited to rights concerning what have been called their
“material” interests.



International law has long recognized that States may have legal
interests in matters which do not affect their financial, economic,
or other “material”, or, say, “physical” or “tangible” interests.

One type of illustration of this principle of international law is
