                   1950s were generally to be found within a range of 60 nautical miles from the coast
                   — Orientation of the coast — Location of main ports in the region — Zone of
                   tolerance along the parallel for small fishing boats — Principal fishing activity
                   carried out by small boats — Fisheries activity, in itself, not determinative of
                   extent of the boundary — Parties however unlikely to have considered the agreed
                   maritime boundary to extend to 200‑nautical‑mile limit — Contemporaneous
                   developments in the law of the sea — State practice — Work of the International
                   Law Commission — Claim made in 1952 Santiago Declaration did not correspond
                   to the international law of that time — No evidence to conclude that the agreed
                   maritime boundary along parallel extended beyond 80 nautical miles.



                      Assessment of relevant practice of the Parties post‑1954 — Legislative practice
                   of the Parties — 1955 Protocol of Accession to 1952 Santiago Declaration —
                   Enforcement activities — 1968‑1969 lighthouse arrangements — Negotiations
                   with Bolivia (1975‑1976) — Positions of the Parties at Third United Nations
                   Conference on the Law of the Sea — 1986 Bákula Memorandum — Practice after
                   1986 — No basis to put into question the Court’s earlier conclusion.

                     In view of entirety of relevant evidence presented to the Court, agreed maritime
                   boundary between the Parties extends to a distance of 80 nautical miles along the
                   parallel.

                    10 	                    maritime dispute (judgment)

                      The Court,
                      composed as above,
                      after deliberation,
                      delivers the following Judgment :
                       1. On 16 January 2008, the Republic of Peru (hereinafter “Peru”) filed in the
                    Registry of the Court an Application instituting proceedings against the Repub-
                    lic of Chile (hereinafter “Chile”) in respect of a dispute concerning, on the one
                    hand, “the delimitation of the boundary between the maritime zones of the two
                    States in the Pacific Ocean, beginning at a point on the coast called Concor-
                    dia . . . the terminal point of the land boundary established pursuant to the
                    Treaty . . . of 3 June 1929” and, on the other, the recognition in favour of Peru
                    of a “maritime zone lying within 200 nautical miles of Peru’s coast” and which
                    should thus appertain to it, “but which Chile considers to be part of the high
                    seas”.
                       In its Application, Peru seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on Arti-
                    cle XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement signed on 30 April 1948,
                    officially designated, according to Article LX thereof, as the “Pact of Bogotá”
                    (hereinafter referred to as such).
                       2. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court,
                    the Registrar immediately communicated the Application to the Government of
                    Chile ; and, under paragraph 3 of that Article, all other States entitled to appear
                    before the Court were notified of the Application.
                       3. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of
                    Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the Pact of Bogotá the noti-
                    fications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court. In
                    accordance with the provisions of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court,
                    the Registrar moreover addressed to the Organization of American States (here-
                    inafter the “OAS”) the notification provided for in Article 34, paragraph 3, of
                    the Statute of the Court. As provided for in Article 69, paragraph 3, of the
                    Rules of Court, the Registry transmitted the written pleadings to the OAS and
                    asked that organization whether or not it intended to furnish observations in
                    writing within the meaning of that Article ; the OAS indicated that it did not
                    intend to submit any such observations.
                       4. On the instructions of the Court, in accordance with the provisions of
                    Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the Registrar addressed to the
                    Permanent Commission for the South Pacific (hereinafter the “CPPS”, from the
                    Spanish acronym for “Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur”) the notification
                    provided for in Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Statute of the Court with regard
                    to the Declaration on the Maritime Zone, signed by Chile, Ecuador and Peru, in
                    Santiago on 18 August 1952 (hereinafter the “1952 Santiago Declaration”), and
                    to the Agreement relating to a Special Maritime Frontier Zone, signed by the
                    same three States in Lima on 4 December 1954 (hereinafter the “1954 Special
                    Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement”). In response, the CPPS indicated that it
                    did not intend to submit any observations in writing within the meaning of Arti-
                    cle 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court.
                       5. On the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of Court,
                    the Registrar addressed to Ecuador, as a State party to the 1952 Santiago Dec-
                    laration and to the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement, the notifi-
                    cation provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court.

                    11 	                    maritime dispute (judgment)

                       6. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
                    either of the Parties, each Party proceeded to exercise the right conferred upon
                    it by Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the
                    case. Peru chose Mr. Gilbert Guillaume and Chile Mr. Francisco Orrego Vicuña.
                       7. By an Order dated 31 March 2008, the Court fixed 20 March 2009 as the
                    time‑limit for the filing of the Memorial of Peru and 9 March 2010 as the
                    time‑limit for the filing of the Counter‑Memorial of Chile. Those pleadings were
                    duly filed within the time‑limits so prescribed.
                       8. By an Order of 27 April 2010, the Court authorized the submission of a
                    Reply by Peru and a Rejoinder by Chile, and fixed 9 November 2010 and
                    11 July 2011 as the respective time‑limits for the filing of those pleadings. The
                    Reply and the Rejoinder were duly filed within the time‑limits thus fixed.

                       9. Referring to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Govern-
                    ments of Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia asked to be furnished with copies of
                    the pleadings and documents annexed in the case. Having ascertained the views
                    of the Parties pursuant to that same provision, the Court decided to grant each
                    of these requests. The Registrar duly communicated these decisions to the said
                    Governments and to the Parties.

                      10. In accordance with Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the
                    Court, after having ascertained the views of the Parties, decided that copies of
                    the pleadings and documents annexed would be made accessible to the public on
                    the opening of the oral proceedings.
                      11. Public hearings were held between 3 and 14 December 2012, at which the
                    Court heard the oral arguments and replies of :
                    For Peru :	H.E. Mr. Allan Wagner,
                                 Mr. Alain Pellet,

                                 Mr. Tullio Treves,
                                 Sir Michael Wood,
                                 Mr. Vaughan Lowe.
                    For Chile : H.E. Mr. Albert van Klaveren Stork,
                                 Mr. Pierre‑Marie Dupuy,

                                 Mr. James Crawford,
                                 Mr. Jan Paulsson,
                                 Mr. Georgios Petrochilos,
                                 Mr. Luigi Condorelli,
                                 Mr. Samuel Wordsworth.
                      12. At the hearings, a Member of the Court put a question to the Parties, to
                    which replies were given orally in accordance with Article 61, paragraph 4, of
                    the Rules of Court.

                      13. In its Application, the following requests were made by Peru :
                           “Peru requests the Court to determine the course of the boundary between
                         the maritime zones of the two States in accordance with international law . . .

                         the maritime area situated within the limit of 200 nautical miles from its coast
                         but outside Chile’s exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.

                            The Government of Peru, further, reserves its right to supplement, amend
                         or modify the present Application in the course of the proceedings.”
                      14. In the written proceedings, the following submissions were presented by
                    the Parties :
                    On behalf of the Government of Peru,
                    in the Memorial and in the Reply :
                            “For the reasons set out [in Peru’s Memorial and Reply], the Republic
                         of Peru requests the Court to adjudge and declare that :

                             Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile, is a line starting at ‘Point
                             Concordia’ (defined as the intersection with the low‑water mark of a
                             10‑kilometre radius arc, having as its centre the first bridge over the River
                             Lluta of the Arica‑La Paz railway) and equidistant from the baselines of
                             both Parties, up to a point situated at a distance of 200 nautical miles

                         (2) Beyond the point where the common maritime border ends, Peru is

                           The Republic of Peru reserves its right to amend these submissions as the
                         case may be in the course of the present proceedings.”

                                                  I. Geography

                       16. Peru and Chile are situated in the western part of South America ;
                    their mainland coasts face the Pacific Ocean. Peru shares a land boundary
                    with Ecuador to its north and with Chile to its south. In the area with
                    which these proceedings are concerned, Peru’s coast runs in a north‑west
                    direction from the starting‑point of the land boundary between the Par-
                    ties on the Pacific coast and Chile’s generally follows a north‑south orien-
                    tation. The coasts of both Peru and Chile in that area are mostly
                    uncomplicated and relatively smooth, with no distinct promontories or
                    other distinguishing features. (See sketch‑map No. 1 : Geographical con-
                    text, p. 14.)


                                          II. Historical Background

                       17. Chile gained its independence from Spain in 1818 and Peru did so
                    in 1821. At the time of independence, Peru and Chile were not neighbour-
                    ing States. Situated between the two countries was the Spanish colonial
                    territory of Charcas which, as from 1825, became the Republic of Bolivia.
                    In 1879 Chile declared war on Peru and Bolivia, in what is known his-
                    torically as the War of the Pacific. In 1883 hostilities between Chile and
                    Peru formally came to an end under the Treaty of Ancón. Under its
                    terms, Peru ceded to Chile the coastal province of Tarapacá ; in addition,
                    Chile gained possession of the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica for
                    a period of ten years on the basis of an agreement that after that period
                    of time there would be a plebiscite to determine sovereignty over these
                    provinces. After the signing of the truce between Bolivia and Chile in
                    1884 and of the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between them, the
                    entire Bolivian coast became Chilean.
                       18. Chile and Peru failed to agree on the terms of the above‑mentioned
                    plebiscite. Finally, on 3 June 1929, following mediation attempts by the
                    President of the United States of America, the two countries signed the
                    Treaty for the Settlement of the Dispute regarding Tacna and Arica
                    (hereinafter the “1929 Treaty of Lima”) and its Additional Protocol,
                    whereby they agreed that Tacna would be returned to Peru while Chile
                    would retain Arica. The 1929 Treaty of Lima also fixed the land bound-
                    ary between the two countries. Under Article 3 of that Treaty, the Parties
                    agreed that a Mixed Commission of Limits should be constituted in order
                    to determine and mark the agreed boundary using a series of markers
                    (“hitos” in Spanish). In its 1930 Final Act, the 1929‑1930 Mixed Commis-
                    sion recorded the precise locations of the 80 markers that it had placed on
                    the ground to demarcate the land boundary.
                       19. In 1947 both Parties unilaterally proclaimed certain maritime rights
                    extending 200 nautical miles from their coasts (hereinafter collectively the
                    “1947 Proclamations”). The President of Chile issued a Declaration con-

                    The President of Peru issued Supreme Decree No. 781, claiming the rights
                    of his country, on 1 August 1947 (hereinafter the “1947 Decree” or
                    “Peru’s 1947 Decree”, reproduced at paragraph 38 below).

                       20. In 1952, 1954 and 1967, Chile, Ecuador and Peru negotiated
                    twelve instruments to which the Parties in this case make reference. Four
                    were adopted in Santiago in August 1952 during the Conference on the
                    Exploitation and Conservation of the Marine Resources of the South
                    Pacific (the Regulations for Maritime Hunting Operations in the Waters
                    of the South Pacific ; the Joint Declaration concerning Fishing Problems
                    in the South Pacific ; the Santiago Declaration ; and the Agreement relat-
                    ing to the Organization of the Permanent Commission of the Conference
                    on the Exploitation and Conservation of the Marine Resources of the
                    South Pacific). Six others were adopted in Lima in December 1954
                    (the Complementary Convention to the Declaration of Sovereignty on
                    the Two‑Hundred‑Mile Maritime Zone ; the Convention on the System
                    of Sanctions ; the Agreement relating to Measures of Supervision and
                    Control in the Maritime Zones of the Signatory Countries ; the Conven-
                    tion on the Granting of Permits for the Exploitation of the Resources of
                    the South Pacific ; the Convention on the Ordinary Annual Meeting of
                    the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific ; and the Agreement
                    relating to a Special Maritime Frontier Zone). And, finally, two agree-
                    ments relating to the functioning of the CPPS were signed in Quito in
                    May 1967.
                       21. On 3 December 1973, the very day the Third United Nations Con-
                    ference on the Law of the Sea began, the twelve instruments were submit-
                    ted by the three signatory States to the United Nations Secretariat for
                    registration under Article 102 of the Charter. The four 1952 instruments
                    (including the Santiago Declaration) were registered on 12 May 1976
                    (United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS), Vol. 1006, pp. 301, 315, 323 and
                    331, Registration Nos. I‑14756 to I‑14759). The United Nations Treaty
                    Series specifies that the four 1952 treaties came into force on
                    18 August 1952 upon signature. The 1954 Special Maritime Frontier
                    Zone Agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat on
                    24 August 2004 (UNTS, Vol. 2274, p. 527, Registration No. I‑40521). The
                    United Nations Treaty Series indicates that the 1954 Special Maritime
                    Frontier Zone Agreement entered into force on 21 September 1967 by the
                    exchange of instruments of ratification. With regard to the two 1967 agree-
                    ments, the Secretariat was informed in 1976 that the signatory States had
                    agreed not to insist upon the registration of these instruments, as they
                    related to matters of purely internal organization.


                      Representatives of the three States also signed in 1955 and later ratified
                    the Agreement for the Regulation of Permits for the Exploitation of the
                    Resources of the South Pacific. That treaty was not, however, submitted

                                           III. Positions of the Parties

                       22. Peru and Chile have adopted fundamentally different positions in
                    this case. Peru argues that no agreed maritime boundary exists between
                    the two countries and asks the Court to plot a boundary line using the
                    equidistance method in order to achieve an equitable result. Chile con-
                    tends that the 1952 Santiago Declaration established an international
                    maritime boundary along the parallel of latitude passing through the
                    starting‑point of the Peru‑Chile land boundary and extending to a mini-
                    mum of 200 nautical miles. It further relies on several agreements and
                    subsequent practice as evidence of that boundary. Chile asks the Court to
                    confirm the boundary line accordingly. (See sketch‑map No. 2 : The mari­
                    time boundary lines claimed by Peru and Chile respectively, p. 17.)

                       Peru also argues that, beyond the point where the common maritime
                    boundary ends, it is entitled to exercise exclusive sovereign rights over a
                    maritime area lying out to a distance of 200 nautical miles from its base-
                    lines. (This maritime area is depicted on sketch‑map No. 2 in a darker
                    shade of blue.) Chile responds that Peru has no entitlement to any mari-
                    time zone extending to the south of the parallel of latitude along which,
                    as Chile maintains, the international maritime boundary runs.
                       23. Chile contends that the principle of pacta sunt servanda and the
                    principle of stability of boundaries prevent any attempt to invite the
                    Court to redraw a boundary that has already been agreed. Chile adds
                    that there have been significant benefits to both Parties as a result of the
                    stability of their long‑standing maritime boundary. Peru argues that the
                    delimitation line advocated by Chile is totally inequitable as it accords
                    Chile a full 200‑nautical‑mile maritime extension, whereas Peru, in con-
                    trast, suffers a severe cut‑off effect. Peru states that it is extraordinary for
                    Chile to seek to characterize a boundary line, which accords Chile more
                    than twice as much maritime area as it would Peru, as a stable frontier
                    which is beneficial to Peru.



                                             IV. Whether There Is
                                         an Agreed Maritime Boundary

                       24. In order to settle the dispute before it, the Court must first ascer-
                    tain whether an agreed maritime boundary exists, as Chile claims. In
                    addressing this question, the Parties considered the significance of the
                    1947 Proclamations, the 1952 Santiago Declaration and various agree-
                    ments concluded in 1952 and 1954. They also referred to the practice of

                                  1. The 1947 Proclamations of Chile and Peru
                      25. As noted above (see paragraph 19), in their 1947 Proclamations,
                    Chile and Peru unilaterally proclaimed certain maritime rights extending
                    200 nautical miles from their respective coasts.

                       26. The Parties agree that the relevant historical background to these
                    Proclamations involves a number of comparable proclamations by other
                    States, namely the United States of America’s two Proclamations of its
                    policy with respect to both the natural resources of the subsoil and
                    sea‑bed of the continental shelf, and coastal fisheries in certain areas of
                    the high seas, both dated 28 September 1945, the Mexican Declaration
                    with Respect to Continental Shelf dated 29 October 1945 and the Argen-
                    tinean Declaration Proclaiming Sovereignty over the Epicontinental Sea
                    and the Continental Shelf dated 11 October 1946. Both Parties agree on
                    the importance of fish and whale resources to their economies, submitting
                    that the above‑mentioned Proclamations by the United States of America
                    placed increased pressure on the commercial exploitation of fisheries off
                    the coast of the Pacific States of Latin America, thus motivating their
                    1947 Proclamations.

                       27. Beyond this background, the Parties present differing interpreta-
                    tions of both the content and legal significance of the 1947 Proclama-
                    tions.
                       28. According to Peru, Chile’s 1947 Declaration was an initial and
                    innovative step, whereby it asserted an alterable claim to jurisdiction,
                    dependent on the adoption of further measures ; nothing in this Declara-
                    tion indicated any intention, on the part of Chile, to address the question
                    of lateral maritime boundaries with neighbouring States. Peru argues that
                    its own 1947 Decree is similarly provisional, representing an initial step
                    and not purporting to fix definitive limits of Peruvian jurisdiction.

                       Peru contends that although its 1947 Decree refers to the Peruvian
                    zone of control and protection as “the area covered between the coast
                    and an imaginary parallel line to it at a distance of two hundred (200) naut­
                    ical miles measured following the line of the geographical parallels”,
                    such reference simply described the manner in which the seaward limits of
                    the maritime zone would be drawn, with there being no intention to set
                    any lateral boundaries with neighbouring States. Peru further considers
                    that, according to terminology at the relevant time, the language of “sov-
                    ereignty” in its 1947 Decree referred simply to rights over resources.
                       29. By contrast, Chile understands the Parties’ 1947 Proclamations as
                    more relevant, considering them to be “concordant unilateral proclama-





5 CIJ1057.indb 34                                                                                   1/12/14 08:59

                    tions, each claiming sovereignty to a distance of 200 nautical miles”,
                    being “substantially similar in form, content and effect”. Chile observes
                    that each of the Parties proclaims national sovereignty over its adjacent
                    continental shelf, as well as in respect of the water column, indicating also
                    a right to extend the outer limit of its respective maritime zone.

                      30. Peru contests Chile’s description of the 1947 Proclamations as
                    “concordant”, emphasizing that, although Chile’s 1947 Declaration and
                    Peru’s 1947 Decree were closely related in time and object, they were not
                    co‑ordinated or agreed between the Parties.

                       31. Chile further argues that the 1947 Proclamations set clear bound-
                    aries of the maritime zones referred to therein. Chile contends that the
                    method in Peru’s 1947 Decree of using a geographical parallel to measure
                    the outward limit of the maritime zone also necessarily determines the
                    northern and southern lateral limits of such zone along such line of geo-
                    graphical parallel. According to Chile, its own references to a “perimeter”
                    and to the “mathematical parallel” in its 1947 Declaration could be simi-
                    larly understood as indicating that a tracé parallèle method was used to
                    indicate the perimeter of the claimed Chilean zone.


                      32. Chile adds that parallels of latitude were also used in the practice
                    of American States. Peru responds that the use of parallels of latitude by
                    other American States described by Chile are not instances of the use of
                    parallels of latitude as international maritime boundaries.

                       33. For Chile, the primary significance of the 1947 Proclamations is as
                    antecedents to the 1952 Santiago Declaration. Chile also refers to the
                    1947 Proclamations as circumstances of the conclusion of the 1952 San-
                    tiago Declaration and the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agree-
                    ment, in accordance with Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the
                    Law of Treaties. Chile maintains that the 1947 Proclamations, in particu-
                    lar Peru’s use of a “line of the geographic parallels” to measure its mari-
                    time projection, rendered the boundary delimitation uncontroversial in
                    1952, as there could be no less controversial boundary delimitation than
                    when the claimed maritime zones of two adjacent States abut perfectly
                    but do not overlap. However, Chile further clarifies that it does not con-
                    sider that the 1947 Proclamations themselves established a maritime
                    boundary between the Parties.

                       34. Peru questions the Chilean claim that the adjacent maritime zones
                    abut perfectly by pointing out that the 1947 Proclamations do not stipu-
                    late co-ordinates or refer to international boundaries. Peru’s view on the
                    connection between the 1947 Proclamations and the 1952 Santiago Dec-
                    laration is that the 1947 Proclamations cannot constitute circumstances
                    of the 1952 Santiago Declaration’s conclusion in the sense of Article 32





5 CIJ1057.indb 36                                                                                   1/12/14 08:59

                    20 	                            maritime dispute (judgment)

                    of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as they pre‑date the
                    conclusion of the 1952 Santiago Declaration by five years. Peru also
                    questions Chile’s assertion that the 1947 Proclamations constitute
                    ­
                    ­circumstances of the conclusion of the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier
                     Zone Agreement.
                        35. The Parties further disagree on the legal nature of the 1947 Procla-
                     mations, particularly Chile’s 1947 Declaration. Chile contends that the
                     1947 Proclamations each had immediate effect, without the need for fur-
                     ther formality or enacting legislation. Peru denies this, contending rather
                     that Chile’s 1947 Declaration did not have the nature of a legal act. It
                     points to the fact that the 1947 Declaration was published only in a daily
                     newspaper and not in the Official Gazette of Chile.

                      36. Chile’s response to these arguments is that the status of its
                    1947 Declaration under domestic law is not determinative of its status
                    under international law, emphasizing that it was an international claim
                    made by the President of Chile and addressed to the international com-
                    munity. Chile points out that the Parties exchanged formal notifications
                    of their 1947 Proclamations, arguing that the lack of protest thereto dem-
                    onstrates acceptance of the validity of the other’s claim to sovereignty,
                    including in relation to the perimeter. This was challenged by Peru.


                                                                             *
                      37. The relevant paragraphs of Chile’s 1947 Declaration provide as
                    follows :
                             “Considering :
                         1. That the Governments of the United States of America, of Mex-
                               ico and of the Argentine Republic, by presidential declarations
                               made on 28 September 1945, 29 October 1945, and 11 Octo-
                               ber 1946, respectively,
                         �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                         2. That they have explicitly proclaimed the rights of their States to
                               protect, preserve, control and inspect fishing enterprises, with the
                               object of preventing illicit activities threatening to damage or
                               destroy the considerable natural riches of this kind contained in
                               the seas adjacent to their coasts, and which are indispensable to
                               the welfare and progress of their respective peoples ; and that the
                               justice of such claims is indisputable ;
                         3. That it is manifestly convenient, in the case of the Chilean Republic,
                               to issue a similar proclamation of sovereignty, not only by the fact
                               of possessing and having already under exploitation natural riches
                               essential to the life of the nation and contained in the continental
                               shelf, such as the coal‑mines, which are exploited both on the main-
                               land and under the sea, but further because, in view of its topogra-

                                linked to the sea and to all present and future natural riches con-

                          (1) The Government of Chile confirms and proclaims its national
                                sovereignty over all the continental shelf adjacent to the continen-

                                their depth below the sea, and claims by consequence all the nat-
                                ural riches which exist on the said shelf, both in and under it,
                                known or to be discovered.
                          (2) The Government of Chile confirms and proclaims its national
                                sovereignty over the seas adjacent to its coasts whatever may be
                                their depths, and within those limits necessary in order to reserve,

                                nature found on, within and below the said seas, placing within
                                the control of the Government especially all fisheries and whaling
                                activities with the object of preventing the exploitation of natural
                                riches of this kind to the detriment of the inhabitants of Chile and
                                to prevent the spoiling or destruction of the said riches to the
                                detriment of the country and the American continent.
                          (3) The demarcation of the protection zones for whaling and deep
                                sea fishery in the continental and island seas under the control of

                                declaration of sovereignty at any moment which the Government
                                may consider convenient, such demarcation to be ratified, ampli-
                                fied, or modified in any way to conform with the knowledge, dis-
                                coveries, studies and interests of Chile as required in the future.
                                Protection and control is hereby declared immediately over all the
                                seas contained within the perimeter formed by the coast and the
                                mathematical parallel projected into the sea at a distance of
                                200 nautical miles from the coasts of Chilean territory. This
                                demarcation will be calculated to include the Chilean islands,
                                indicating a maritime zone contiguous to the coasts of the said
                                islands, projected parallel to these islands at a distance of 200 naut­
                                ical miles around their coasts.
                          (4) The present declaration of sovereignty does not disregard the
                                ­similar legitimate rights of other States on a basis of reciprocity,
                                 nor does it affect the rights of free navigation on the high seas.”
                        38. The relevant paragraphs of Peru’s 1947 Decree provide as follows :

                            With the advisory vote of the Cabinet,
                            Decrees :
                         1. To declare that national sovereignty and jurisdiction are extended
                            to the submerged continental or insular shelf adjacent to the con-
                            tinental or insular shores of national territory, whatever the depth
                            and extension of this shelf may be.
                         2. National sovereignty and jurisdiction are exercised as well over
                            the sea adjoining the shores of national territory whatever its
                            depth and in the extension necessary to reserve, protect, maintain
                            and utilize natural resources and wealth of any kind which may
                            be found in or below those waters.
                         3. As a result of previous declarations the State reserves the right to
                            establish the limits of the zones of control and protection of nat-
                            ural resources in continental or insular seas which are controlled
                            by the Peruvian Government and to modify such limits in accord-
                            ance with supervening circumstances which may originate as a
                            result of further discoveries, studies or national interests which may
                            become apparent in the future and at the same time declares that
                            it will exercise the same control and protection on the seas adjacent
                            to the Peruvian coast over the area covered between the coast and
                            an imaginary parallel line to it at a distance of two hundred (200)
                            nautical miles measured following the line of the geographical par-
                            allels. As regards islands pertaining to the nation, this demarcation
                            will be traced to include the sea area adjacent to the shores of these
                            islands to a distance of two hundred (200) nautical miles, measured
                            from all points on the contour of these islands.

                    23 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                         4. The present declaration does not affect the right to free navigation
                            of ships of all nations according to international law.”

                       39. The Court notes that the Parties are in agreement that the
                    1947 Proclamations do not themselves establish an international mari-
                    time boundary. The Court therefore will consider the 1947 Proclamations
                    only for the purpose of ascertaining whether the texts evidence the Par-
                    ties’ understanding as far as the establishment of a future maritime
                    boundary between them is concerned.
                       40. The Court observes that paragraph 3 of Chile’s 1947 Declaration
                    referred to a “mathematical parallel” projected into the sea to a distance
                    of 200 nautical miles from the Chilean coast. Such a mathematical paral-
                    lel limited the seaward extent of the projection, but did not fix its lateral
                    limits. The 1947 Declaration nonetheless stated that it concerned the con-
                    tinental shelf and the seas “adjacent” to the Chilean coasts. It implied the
                    need to fix, in the future, the lateral limits of the jurisdiction that it was
                    seeking to establish within a specified perimeter. The Court further notes
                    that Peru’s 1947 Decree, in paragraph 3, referred to “geographical paral-
                    lels” in identifying its maritime zone. The description of the relevant mar-
                    itime zones in the 1947 Proclamations appears to use a tracé parallèle
                    method. However, the utilization of such method is not sufficient to evi-
                    dence a clear intention of the Parties that their eventual maritime bound-
                    ary would be a parallel.

                       41. The Court recalls that paragraph 3 of Chile’s 1947 Declaration
                    provides for the establishment of protective zones for whaling and deep
                    sea fishery, considering that these may be modified in any way “to con-
                    form with the knowledge, discoveries, studies and interests of Chile as
                    required in the future”. This conditional language cannot be seen as com-
                    mitting Chile to a particular method of delimiting a future lateral bound-
                    ary with its neighbouring States ; rather, Chile’s concern relates to the
                    establishment of a zone of protection and control so as to ensure the
                    exploitation and preservation of natural resources.

                       42. The language of Peru’s 1947 Decree is equally conditional. In para-
                    graph 3, Peru reserves the right to modify its “zones of control and pro-
                    tection” as a result of “national interests which may become apparent in
                    the future”.
                       43. In view of the above, the language of the 1947 Proclamations, as
                    well as their provisional nature, precludes an interpretation of them as
                    reflecting a shared understanding of the Parties concerning maritime
                    delimitation. At the same time, the Court observes that the Parties’
                    1947 Proclamations contain similar claims concerning their rights and
                    jurisdiction in the maritime zones, giving rise to the necessity of establish-
                    ing the lateral limits of these zones in the future.

                    24 	                   maritime dispute (judgment)

                       44. Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not need to address
                    Chile’s argument concerning the relevance of the communication of the
                    1947 Proclamations inter se and Peru’s response to that argument. The
                    Court notes, however, that both Peru and Chile simply acknowledged
                    receipt of each other’s notification without making any reference to the pos-
                    sible establishment of an international maritime boundary between them.

                                         2. The 1952 Santiago Declaration
                       45. As noted above (see paragraph 20), the Santiago Declaration was
                    signed by Chile, Ecuador and Peru during the 1952 Conference held in
                    Santiago de Chile on the Exploitation and Conservation of the Marine
                    Resources of the South Pacific.
                       46. According to Chile, the 1952 Santiago Declaration has been a
                    treaty from its inception and was always intended by its signatories to be
                    legally binding. Chile further notes that the United Nations Treaty Series
                    indicates that the 1952 Santiago Declaration entered into force upon sig-
                    nature on 18 August 1952, with there being no record of any objection by
                    Peru to such indication.
                       47. Peru considers that the 1952 Santiago Declaration was not con-
                    ceived as a treaty, but rather as a proclamation of the international mari-
                    time policy of the three States. Peru claims that it was thus “declarative”
                    in character, but accepts that it later acquired the status of a treaty after
                    being ratified by each signatory (Chile in 1954, Ecuador and Peru in 1955)
                    and registered as such with the United Nations Secretariat on 12 May 1976,
                    pursuant to Article 102, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United
                    Nations.


                                                          *
                       48. In view of the above, the Court observes that it is no longer con-
                    tested that the 1952 Santiago Declaration is an international treaty. The
                    Court’s task now is to ascertain whether it established a maritime bound-
                    ary between the Parties.
                       49. The 1952 Santiago Declaration provides as follows :
                         “1. Governments have the obligation to ensure for their peoples the
                             necessary conditions of subsistence, and to provide them with the
                             resources for their economic development.
                          2. Consequently, they are responsible for the conservation and pro-
                             tection of their natural resources and for the regulation of the
                             development of these resources in order to secure the best possible
                             advantages for their respective countries.
                          3. Thus, it is also their duty to prevent any exploitation of these
                             resources, beyond the scope of their jurisdiction, which endangers
                             the existence, integrity and conservation of these resources to the

                    25 	                   maritime dispute (judgment)

                              detriment of the peoples who, because of their geographical situ-
                              ation, possess irreplaceable means of subsistence and vital eco-
                              nomic resources in their seas.
                            In view of the foregoing considerations, the Governments of Chile,
                         Ecuador and Peru, determined to conserve and safeguard for their
                         respective peoples the natural resources of the maritime zones adja-
                         cent to their coasts, formulate the following Declaration :
                           I. The geological and biological factors which determine the exist-
                              ence, conservation and development of marine fauna and flora in
                              the waters along the coasts of the countries making the Declar­
                              ation are such that the former extension of the territorial sea and
                              the contiguous zone are inadequate for the purposes of the con-
                              servation, development and exploitation of these resources, to
                              which the coastal countries are entitled.
                          II. In the light of these circumstances, the Governments of Chile,
                              Ecuador and Peru proclaim as a norm of their international mari­
                              time policy that they each possess exclusive sovereignty and juris-
                              diction over the sea along the coasts of their respective countries
                              to a minimum distance of 200 nautical miles from these coasts.
                         III. The exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over this maritime zone
                              shall also encompass exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction over
                              the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof.
                         IV. In the case of island territories, the zone of 200 nautical miles shall
                              apply to the entire coast of the island or group of islands. If an
                              island or group of islands belonging to one of the countries mak-
                              ing the declaration is situated less than 200 nautical miles from
                              the general maritime zone belonging to another of those coun-
                              tries, the maritime zone of the island or group of islands shall be
                              limited by the parallel at the point at which the land frontier of
                              the States concerned reaches the sea.
                          V. This declaration shall be without prejudice to the necessary limi-
                              tations to the exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction established
                              under international law to allow innocent and inoffensive passage
                              through the area indicated for ships of all nations.

                         VI. For the application of the principles contained in this Declar­
                             ation, the Governments of Chile, Ecuador and Peru hereby
                             announce their intention to sign agreements or conventions which
                             shall establish general norms to regulate and protect hunting and
                             fishing within the maritime zone belonging to them, and to regu-
                             late and co‑ordinate the exploitation and development of all other
                             kinds of products or natural resources existing in these waters
                             which are of common interest.”

5 CIJ1057.indb 48                                                                                      1/12/14 08:59

                    26 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                       50. Peru asserts that the 1952 Santiago Declaration lacks characteris-
                    tics which might be expected of a boundary agreement, namely, an appro-
                    priate format, a definition or description of a boundary, cartographic
                    material and a requirement for ratification. Chile disagrees with Peru’s
                    arguments concerning the characteristics of boundary agreements, point-
                    ing out that a treaty effecting a boundary delimitation can take any form.
                    
                       51. According to Chile, it follows from paragraph IV of the 1952 San-
                    tiago Declaration that the maritime boundary between neighbouring
                    States parties is the parallel of latitude passing through the point at which
                    the land boundary between them reaches the sea. Chile contends that
                    paragraph IV delimits both the general and insular maritime zones of the
                    States parties, arguing that the reference to islands in this provision is a
                    specific application of a generally agreed rule, the specification of which is
                    explained by the particular importance of islands to Ecuador’s geograph-
                    ical circumstances. In support of this claim, Chile relies upon the minutes
                    of the 1952 Conference dated 11 August 1952, asserting that the Ecuador-
                    ean delegate requested clarification that the boundary line of the jurisdic-
                    tional zone of each country be the respective parallel from the point at
                    which the border of the countries touches or reaches the sea and that all
                    States expressed their mutual consent to such an understanding. Chile
                    argues that such an understanding, as recorded in the minutes, constitutes
                    an agreement relating to the conclusion of the 1952 Santiago Declaration,
                    within the meaning of Article 31, paragraph 2 (a), of the Vienna Conven-
                    tion on the Law of Treaties. Although Chile recognizes that the issue of
                    islands was of particular concern to Ecuador, it also stresses that there
                    are relevant islands in the vicinity of the Peru‑Chile border.
                       52. Chile maintains that the relationship between general and insular
                    maritime zones must be understood in light of the fact that the delimita-
                    tion of insular zones along a line of parallel is only coherent and effective
                    if there is also a general maritime delimitation along such parallel. Fur-
                    ther, Chile points out that, in order to determine if an island is situated
                    less than 200 nautical miles from the general maritime zone of another
                    State party to the 1952 Santiago Declaration, the perimeter of such gen-
                    eral maritime zone must have already been defined.
                       53. Peru argues that in so far as the continental coasts of the States
                    parties are concerned, the 1952 Santiago Declaration simply claims a
                    maritime zone extending to a minimum distance of 200 nautical miles,
                    addressing only seaward and not lateral boundaries. In Peru’s view, para-
                    graph IV of the 1952 Santiago Declaration refers only to the entitlement
                    generated by certain islands and not to the entitlement generated by con-
                    tinental coasts, with the issue of islands being relevant only between
                    Ecuador and Peru, not between Peru and Chile. Peru contends that even
                    if some very small islands exist in the vicinity of the Peru‑Chile border
                    these are immediately adjacent to the coast and do not have any effect on
                    maritime entitlements distinct from the coast itself, nor were they of con-
                    cern during the 1952 Conference.

                    27 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                       54. Peru rejects Chile’s argument that a general maritime delimitation
                    must be assumed in paragraph IV so as to make the reference to insular
                    delimitation effective. It also questions that a maritime boundary could
                    result from an alleged practice implying or presupposing its existence.
                    Peru argues that, if it were true that parallels had been established as
                    international maritime boundaries prior to 1952, there would have been
                    no need to include paragraph IV as such boundaries would have already
                    settled the question of the extent of the maritime entitlements of islands.
                    Peru further claims that the purpose of paragraph IV is to provide a pro-
                    tective zone for insular maritime entitlements so that even if an eventual
                    maritime delimitation occurred in a manner otherwise detrimental to such
                    insular entitlements, it could only do so as far as the line of parallel
                    referred to therein. Finally, Peru contests Chile’s interpretation of the
                    minutes of the 1952 Conference, arguing also that these do not constitute
                    any form of “recorded agreement” but could only amount to travaux
                    préparatoires.
                       55. According to Chile, the object and purpose of the 1952 Santiago
                    Declaration can be stated at varying levels of specificity. Its most gener-
                    ally stated object and purpose is “to conserve and safeguard for their
                    respective peoples the natural resources of the maritime zones adjacent to
                    [the parties’] coasts”. It also has a more specific object and purpose,
                    namely to set forth zones of “exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction”. This
                    object and purpose is naturally concerned with identifying the physical
                    perimeter of each State’s maritime zone within which such sovereignty
                    and jurisdiction would be exercised. Chile further emphasizes that,
                    although the 1952 Santiago Declaration constitutes a joint proclamation
                    of sovereignty, it is made by each of the three States parties, each claim-
                    ing sovereignty over a maritime zone which is distinct from that claimed
                    by the other two.
                       56. Peru agrees with Chile to the extent that the 1952 Santiago Decla-
                    ration involves joint action to declare the maritime rights of States parties
                    to a minimum distance of 200 nautical miles from their coasts so as to
                    protect and preserve the natural resources adjacent to their territories.
                    Yet, Peru focuses on the 1952 Conference’s purpose as being to address
                    collectively the problem of whaling in South Pacific waters, arguing that,
                    in order to do so, it was necessary that “between them” the States parties
                    police the 200‑nautical‑mile zone effectively. According to Peru, the object
                    and purpose of the 1952 Santiago Declaration was not the division of
                    fishing grounds between its States parties, but to create a zone function-
                    ing “as a single biological unit” — an exercise of regional solidarity —
                    designed to address the threat posed by foreign whaling. Thus, Peru
                    stresses that the 1952 Santiago Declaration does not include any stipula-
                    tion as to how the States parties’ maritime zones are delimited from each
                    other.

                    28 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                       57. The Court is required to analyse the terms of the 1952 Santiago
                    Declaration in accordance with the customary international law of treaty
                    interpretation, as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention
                    on the Law of Treaties (see Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.
                    United States of America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                    1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23 ; Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/
                    Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, pp. 21‑22, para. 41). The Court
                    applied these rules to the interpretation of treaties which pre‑date the
                    Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Dispute regarding Naviga­
                    tional and Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Judgment,
                    I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 237, para. 47 ; Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and
                    Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002,
                    pp. 645‑646, paras. 37‑38 ; Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia),
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18).
                       58. The Court commences by considering the ordinary meaning to be
                    given to the terms of the 1952 Santiago Declaration in their context, in
                    accordance with Article 31, paragraph 1, of the Vienna Convention on
                    the Law of Treaties. The 1952 Santiago Declaration does not make
                    express reference to the delimitation of maritime boundaries of the zones
                    generated by the continental coasts of its States parties. This is com-
                    pounded by the lack of such information which might be expected in an
                    agreement determining maritime boundaries, namely, specific co‑ordi-
                    nates or cartographic material. Nevertheless, the 1952 Santiago Declara-
                    tion contains certain elements (in its paragraph IV) which are relevant to
                    the issue of maritime delimitation (see paragraph 60 below).

                       59. The Court notes that in paragraph II, the States parties “proclaim
                    as a norm of their international maritime policy that they each possess
                    exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea along the coasts of
                    their respective countries to a minimum distance of 200 nautical miles
                    from these coasts”. This provision establishes only a seaward claim and
                    makes no reference to the need to distinguish the lateral limits of the mar-
                    itime zones of each State party. Paragraph III states that “[t]he exclusive
                    jurisdiction and sovereignty over this maritime zone shall also encompass
                    exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea-bed and the subsoil
                    thereof”. Such a reference to jurisdiction and sovereignty does not neces-
                    sarily require any delimitation to have already occurred. Paragraph VI
                    expresses the intention of the States parties to establish by agreement in
                    the future general norms of regulation and protection to be applied in
                    their respective maritime zones. Accordingly, although a description of
                    the distance of maritime zones and reference to the exercise of jurisdiction
                    and sovereignty might indicate that the States parties were not unaware
                    of issues of general delimitation, the Court concludes that neither para-
                    graph II nor paragraph III refers explicitly to any lateral boundaries of
                    the proclaimed 200‑nautical‑mile maritime zones, nor can the need for
                    such boundaries be implied by the references to jurisdiction and sover-
                    eignty.

                    29 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                       60. The Court turns now to paragraph IV of the 1952 Santiago Dec­
                    laration. The first sentence of paragraph IV specifies that the proclaimed
                    200‑nautical‑mile maritime zones apply also in the case of island territo-
                    ries. The second sentence of that paragraph addresses the situation where
                    an island or group of islands of one State party is located less than
                    200 nautical miles from the general maritime zone of another State party.
                    In this situation, the limit of the respective zones shall be the parallel at
                    the point at which the land frontier of the State concerned reaches the
                    sea. The Court observes that this provision, the only one in the 1952 San-
                    tiago Declaration making any reference to the limits of the States parties’
                    maritime zones, is silent regarding the lateral limits of the maritime zones
                    which are not derived from island territories and which do not abut them.
                    
                       61. The Court is not convinced by Chile’s argument that paragraph IV
                    can be understood solely if it is considered to delimit not only insular
                    maritime zones but also the entirety of the general maritime zones of the
                    States parties. The ordinary meaning of paragraph IV reveals a particular
                    interest in the maritime zones of islands which may be relevant even if a
                    general maritime zone has not yet been established. In effect, it appears
                    that the States parties intended to resolve a specific issue which could
                    obviously create possible future tension between them by agreeing that
                    the parallel would limit insular zones.


                       62. In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the ordinary
                    meaning of paragraph IV, read in its context, goes no further than estab-
                    lishing the Parties’ agreement concerning the limits between certain insu-
                    lar maritime zones and those zones generated by the continental coasts
                    which abut such insular maritime zones.
                       63. The Court now turns to consider the object and purpose of the
                    1952 Santiago Declaration. It recalls that both Parties state such object
                    and purpose narrowly : Peru argues that the Declaration is primarily con-
                    cerned with addressing issues of large‑scale whaling, whereas Chile argues
                    that it can be most specifically understood as concerned with identifying
                    the perimeters of the maritime zone of each State party. The Court
                    observes that the Preamble of the 1952 Santiago Declaration focuses on
                    the conservation and protection of the necessary natural resources for the
                    subsistence and economic development of the peoples of Chile, Ecuador
                    and Peru, through the extension of the maritime zones adjacent to their
                    coasts.
                       64. The Court further considers that it is not necessary for it to address
                    the existence of small islands located close to the coast in the region of the
                    Peru‑Chile land boundary. The case file demonstrates that the issue of
                    insular zones in the context of the 1952 Santiago Declaration arose from
                    a concern expressed by Ecuador. It is equally clear from the case file that
                    the small islands do not appear to have been of concern to the Parties. As
                    stated by Chile in its Rejoinder, referring to these small islands, “[n]one of





5 CIJ1057.indb 56                                                                                    1/12/14 08:59

                    them was mentioned in the negotiating record related to the 1952 San­
                    tiago Declaration . . . The only islands that were mentioned in the con-
                    text of the Santiago Declaration were Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands.” Peru
                    did not contest this.

                       65. The Court recalls Chile’s argument, based on Article 31, para-
                    graph 2 (a), of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, that the
                    minutes of the 1952 Conference constitute an “agreement relating to the
                    treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the con-
                    clusion of the treaty”. The Court considers that the minutes of the
                    1952 Conference summarize the discussions leading to the adoption of
                    the 1952 Santiago Declaration, rather than record an agreement of the
                    negotiating States. Thus, they are more appropriately characterized as
                    travaux préparatoires which constitute supplementary means of interpre-
                    tation within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the
                    Law of Treaties.
                       66. In light of the above, the Court does not need, in principle, to
                    resort to supplementary means of interpretation, such as the travaux
                    préparatoires of the 1952 Santiago Declaration and the circumstances of
                    its conclusion, to determine the meaning of that Declaration. However, as
                    in other cases (see, for example, Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau
                    Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 653,
                    para. 53 ; Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar
                    and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,
                    I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 21, para. 40 ; Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab
                    Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 27, para. 55), the
                    Court has considered the relevant material, which confirms the above
                    interpretation of the 1952 Santiago Declaration.
                       67. Chile’s original proposal presented to the 1952 Conference pro-
                    vided as follows :
                            “The zone indicated comprises all waters within the perimeter
                         formed by the coasts of each country and a mathematical parallel
                         projected into the sea to 200 nautical miles away from the mainland,
                         along the coastal fringe.
                            In the case of island territories, the zone of 200 nautical miles will
                         apply all around the island or island group.
                            If an island or group of islands belonging to one of the countries
                         making the declaration is situated less than 200 nautical miles from
                         the general maritime zone belonging to another of those countries,
                         according to what has been established in the first paragraph of this
                         article, the maritime zone of the said island or group of islands shall
                         be limited, in the corresponding part, to the distance that separates it
                         from the maritime zone of the other State or country.”
                    The Court notes that this original Chilean proposal appears intended to
                    effect a general delimitation of the maritime zones along lateral lines.
                    However, this proposal was not adopted.

                      68. Further, the minutes of the 1952 Conference indicate that the dele­
                    gate for Ecuador :
                         “observed that it would be advisable to provide more clarity to Arti-
                         cle 3 [which became paragraph IV of the final text of the 1952 San­
                         tiago Declaration], in order to avoid any error in the interpretation
                         of the interference zone in the case of islands, and suggested that the
                         declaration be drafted on the basis that the boundary line of the juris-
                         dictional zone of each country be the respective parallel from the
                         point at which the frontier of the countries touches or reaches the
                         sea”.
                    According to the minutes, this proposition met with the agreement of all
                    of the delegates.
                       Ecuador’s intervention, with which the Parties agreed, is limited in its
                    concern to clarification “in the case of islands”. Thus the Court is of the
                    view that it can be understood as saying no more than that which is
                    already stated in the final text of paragraph IV. The Court considers from
                    the foregoing that the travaux préparatoires confirm its conclusion that
                    the 1952 Santiago Declaration did not effect a general maritime delimita-
                    tion.
                       69. Nevertheless, various factors mentioned in the preceding para-
                    graphs, such as the original Chilean proposal and the use of the parallel
                    as the limit of the maritime zone of an island of one State party located
                    less than 200 nautical miles from the general maritime zone of another
                    State party, suggest that there might have been some sort of shared
                    understanding among the States parties of a more general nature con-
                    cerning their maritime boundaries. The Court will return to this matter
                    later.
                       70. The Court has concluded, contrary to Chile’s submissions, that
                    Chile and Peru did not, by adopting the 1952 Santiago Declaration, agree
                    to the establishment of a lateral maritime boundary between them along
                    the line of latitude running into the Pacific Ocean from the seaward ter-
                    minus of their land boundary. However, in support of its claim that that
                    line constitutes the maritime boundary, Chile also invokes agreements
                    and arrangements which it signed later with Ecuador and Peru, and with
                    Peru alone.

                                         3. The Various 1954 Agreements
                       71. Among the agreements adopted in 1954, Chile emphasizes, in par-
                    ticular, the Complementary Convention to the 1952 Santiago Declaration
                    and the Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement. It puts the meetings
                    that led to those agreements and the agreements themselves in the context
                    of the challenges which six maritime powers had made to the 1952 San-
                    tiago Declaration in the period running from August to late October 1954
                    and of the planned whale hunting by a fleet operating under the Panama-
                    nian flag.

                    32 	                  maritime dispute (judgment)

                       72. The meeting of the CPPS, preparatory to the Inter‑State confer-
                    ence of December 1954, was held between 4 and 8 October 1954. The pro-
                    visional agenda items correspond to five of the six agreements which were
                    drafted and adopted at the December Inter‑State Conference : the Com-
                    plementary Convention to the 1952 Santiago Declaration, the Conven-
                    tion on the System of Sanctions, the Agreement on the Annual Meeting
                    of the CPPS, the Convention on Supervision and Control, and the Con-
                    vention on the Granting of Permits for the Exploitation of the Resources
                    of the South Pacific.
                       73. The 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement also resulted
                    from the meetings that took place in 1954. In addition to considering the
                    matters listed on the provisional agenda described above, the October 1954
                    meeting of the CPPS also considered a proposal by the Delegations of Ecua-
                    dor and Peru to establish a “neutral zone . . . on either side of the parallel
                    which passes through the point of the coast that signals the boundary
                    between the two countries”. The Permanent Commission approved the pro-
                    posal unanimously “and, consequently, entrusted its Secretariat‑General to
                    transmit this recommendation to the signatory countries so that they put
                    into practice this norm of tolerance on fishing activities”. As a consequence,
                    at the inaugural session of “The Second Conference on the Exploitation and
                    Conservation of the Marine Resources of the South Pacific”, the proposed
                    Agreement appeared in the agenda as the last of the six agreements to be
                    considered and signed in December 1954. The draft text relating to the pro-
                    posal to establish a “neutral zone” along the parallel was then amended in
                    certain respects. The term “neutral zone” was replaced with the term “spe-
                    cial maritime frontier zone” and the reference to “the parallel which passes
                    through the point of the coast that signals the boundary between the two
                    countries” was replaced with “the parallel which constitutes the maritime
                    boundary between the two countries”. This is the language that appears in
                    the first paragraph of the final text of the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier
                    Zone Agreement, which was adopted along with the other five agreements
                    referred to in the preceding paragraph. All of the agreements included a
                    standard clause, added late in the drafting process without any explanation
                    recorded in the minutes. According to this clause, the provisions contained
                    in the agreements were “deemed to be an integral and supplementary part”
                    of the resolutions and agreements adopted in 1952 and were “not in any way
                    to abrogate” them. Of these six agreements only the 1954 Complementary
                    Convention and the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement were
                    given any real attention by the Parties in the course of these proceedings,
                    except for brief references by Chile to the Supervision and Control Conven-
                    tion (see paragraph 78 below). The Court notes that the 1954 Special Mari-
                    time Frontier Zone Agreement is still in force.

                         A. The Complementary Convention to the 1952 Santiago Declaration
                      74. According to Chile, “the main instrument” prepared at the
                    1954 Inter‑State Conference was the Complementary Convention, “[t]he





5 CIJ1057.indb 62                                                                                    1/12/14 08:59

                    primary purpose [of which] was to reassert the claim of sovereignty and
                    jurisdiction that had been made two years earlier in Santiago and to
                    defend jointly the claim against protests by third States”. It quotes its
                    Foreign Minister speaking at the inaugural session of the 1954 CPPS
                    Meeting :
                             “The right to proclaim our sovereignty over the sea zone that
                         extends to two hundred miles from the coast is thus undeniable and
                         inalienable. We gather now to reaffirm our decision to defend, what-
                         ever the cost, this sovereignty and to exercise it in accordance with
                         the high national interests of the signatory countries to the Declara-
                         tion.
                         �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                             We strongly believe that, little by little, the legal statement that has
                         been formulated by our countries into the 1952 Agreement [the San-
                         tiago Declaration] will find its place in international law until it is
                         accepted by all Governments that wish to preserve, for mankind,
                         resources that today are ruthlessly destroyed by the unregulated exer-
                         cise of exploitative activities that pursue diminished individual inter-
                         ests and not collective needs.”
                       75. Peru similarly contends that the purpose of the 1954 Complemen-
                    tary Convention was to reinforce regional solidarity in the face of opposi-
                    tion from third States to the 200‑nautical‑mile claim. It observes that in
                    1954, as in 1952, the primary focus of the three States was on maintaining
                    a united front towards third States, “rather than upon the development of
                    an internal legal régime defining their rights inter se”. It also contends
                    that the 1954 instruments were adopted in the context of regional solidar-
                    ity vis‑à‑vis third States and that they were essentially an integral part of
                    the agreements and resolutions adopted in 1952. The Inter‑State Confer-
                    ence was in fact held less than a month after the Peruvian Navy, with the
                    co‑operation of its air force, had seized vessels of the Onassis whaling
                    fleet, under the Panamanian flag, more than 100 nautical miles off shore
                    (for extracts from the Peruvian judgment imposing fines see American
                    Journal of International Law, 1955, Vol. 49, p. 575). Peru notes that when
                    it rejected a United Kingdom protest against the seizure of the Onassis
                    vessels, the Chilean Foreign Minister sent a congratulatory message to his
                    Peruvian counterpart — according to Peru this was “an indication of the
                    regional solidarity which the zone embodied”. In its Reply, Peru recalls
                    Chile’s characterization in its Counter‑Memorial of the 1954 Com­
                    plementary Convention as “the main instrument” prepared at the
                    1954 Inter‑State Conference.


                       76. The Parties also refer to the agreed responses which they made,
                    after careful preparation in the first part of 1955, to the protests made by
                    maritime powers against the 1952 Santiago Declaration. Those responses
                    were made in accordance with the spirit of the Complementary Conven-





5 CIJ1057.indb 64                                                                                                                             1/12/14 08:59

                    tion even though Chile was not then or later a party to it. Similar co‑­
                    ordinated action was taken in May 1955 in response to related proposals
                    made by the United States of America.


                                                          *
                      77. The Court observes that it is common ground that the proposed
                    Complementary Convention was the main instrument addressed by Chile,
                    Ecuador and Peru as they prepared for the CPPS meeting and the
                    Inter‑State Conference in Lima in the final months of 1954. Given the
                    challenges being made by several States to the 1952 Santiago Declaration,
                    the primary purpose of that Convention was to assert, particularly against
                    the major maritime powers, their claim of sovereignty and jurisdiction
                    made jointly in 1952. It was also designed to help prepare their common
                    defence of the claim against the protests by those States, which was the
                    subject‑matter of the second agenda item of the 1954 Inter‑State Confer-
                    ence. It does not follow, however, that the “primary purpose” was the
                    sole purpose or even less that the primary purpose determined the sole
                    outcome of the 1954 meetings and the Inter‑State Conference.


                         B. The Agreement relating to Measures of Supervision and Control
                                of the Maritime Zones of the Signatory Countries
                      78. Chile seeks support from another of the 1954 Agreements, the
                    Agreement relating to Measures of Supervision and Control of the Mari-
                    time Zones of the Signatory Countries. It quotes the first and second
                    articles :
                             “First,
                             It shall be the function of each signatory country to supervise and
                          control the exploitation of the resources in its Maritime Zone by the
                          use of such organs and means as it considers necessary.
                             Second,
                             The supervision and control referred to in Article one shall be exer-
                          cised by each country exclusively in the waters of its jurisdiction.”
                          (Emphasis added by Chile.)
                    Chile contends that the second article proceeds on the basis that each
                    State’s maritime zone had been delimited. Peru made no reference to
                    the substance of this Agreement. Chile also referred in this context to the
                    1955 Agreement for the Regulation of Permits for Exploitation of
                    the Resources of the South Pacific (see paragraph 21 above) and to its
                    1959 Decree providing for that regulation.
                      79. The Court considers that at this early stage there were at least in
                    practice distinct maritime zones in which each of the three States might,
                    in terms of the 1952 Santiago Declaration, take action as indeed was

                    exemplified by the action taken by Peru against the Onassis whaling fleet
                    shortly before the Lima Conference ; other instances of enforcement by
                    the two Parties are discussed later. However the Agreements on Supervi-
                    sion and Control and on the Regulation of Permits give no indication
                    about the location or nature of boundaries of the zones. On the matter of
                    boundaries, the Court now turns to the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier
                    Zone Agreement.


                           C. The Agreement relating to a Special Maritime Frontier Zone
                     80. The Preamble to the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agree-
                    ment reads as follows :
                            “Experience has shown that innocent and inadvertent violations of
                         the maritime frontier [la frontera marítima] between adjacent States
                         occur frequently because small vessels manned by crews with insuffi-
                         cient knowledge of navigation or not equipped with the necessary
                         instruments have difficulty in determining accurately their position on
                         the high seas ;
                         The application of penalties in such cases always produces ill‑­feeling
                         in the fishermen and friction between the countries concerned, which
                         may affect adversely the spirit of co‑operation and unity which should
                         at all times prevail among the countries signatories to the instruments
                         signed at Santiago ; and
                            It is desirable to avoid the occurrence of such unintentional infringe-
                         ments, the consequences of which affect principally the fishermen.”

                      81. The substantive provisions of the Agreement read as follows :
                            “1. A special zone is hereby established, at a distance of [a partir
                         de] 12 nautical miles from the coast, extending to a breadth of
                         10 nautical miles on either side of the parallel which constitutes the
                         maritime boundary [el límite marítimo] between the two countries.
                            2. The accidental presence in the said zone of a vessel of either of
                         the adjacent countries, which is a vessel of the nature described in the
                         paragraph beginning with the words ‘Experience has shown’ in the
                         Preamble hereto, shall not be considered to be a violation of the
                         waters of the maritime zone, though this provision shall not be con-
                         strued as recognizing any right to engage, with deliberate intent, in
                         hunting or fishing in the said special zone.
                            3. Fishing or hunting within the zone of 12 nautical miles from the
                         coast shall be reserved exclusively to the nationals of each country.”
                    Article 4 is the standard provision, included in all six of the 1954 Agree-
                    ments, deeming it to be “an integral and supplementary part” of the
                    1952 instruments which it was not in any way to abrogate (see para-
                    graph 73 above).

                      82. According to Chile, the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone
                    Agreement was “the most relevant instrument adopted at the Decem-
                    ber 1954 Conference”. Its “basic predicate” was that the three States
                    “already had lateral boundaries, or ‘frontiers’, in place between them”.
                    Chile continues, citing the Judgment in the case concerning Territorial
                    Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad), that in the 1954 Special Mari-
                    time Frontier Zone Agreement “the existence of a determined frontier
                    was accepted and acted upon” (I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 35, para. 66). It
                    points out that Article 1 uses the present tense, referring to a maritime
                    boundary already in existence, and the first recital indicates that it was
                    violations of that existing boundary that prompted the Agreement.

                       83. Peru contends (1) that the Agreement was applicable only to Peru’s
                    northern maritime border, that is, with Ecuador, and not also to the
                    southern one, with Chile ; (2) that Chile’s delay in ratifying (in 1967) and
                    registering (in 2004) the Agreement shows that it did not regard it of
                    major importance in establishing a maritime boundary ; and (3) that the
                    Agreement had a very special and temporary purpose and that the Parties
                    were claiming a limited functional jurisdiction. Peru in its written plead-
                    ings, in support of its contention that the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier
                    Zone Agreement applied only to its boundary with Ecuador and not to
                    that with Chile, said that the “rather opaque formula” — the reference to
                    the parallel in Article 1, introduced on the proposal of Ecuador —
                    referred to only one parallel between two countries ; it seems clear, Peru
                    says, that the focus was on the waters between Peru and Ecuador.



                       84. With regard to Peru’s first argument, Chile in reply points out that
                    the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement has three States par-
                    ties and that the ordinary meaning of “the two countries” in Article 1 is a
                    reference to the States on either side of their shared maritime boundary.
                    Chile notes that there is no qualification of the “maritime frontier” (in the
                    Preamble), nor is there any suggestion that the term “adjacent States”
                    refers only to Ecuador and Peru. Chile also points out that in 1962 Peru
                    complained to Chile about “the frequency with which Chilean fishing ves-
                    sels have trespassed into Peruvian waters”, stating that “the Government
                    of Peru, taking strongly into account the sense and provisions of ‘the
                    Agreement’” wished that the Government of Chile take certain steps par-
                    ticularly through the competent authorities at the port of Arica. As Chile
                    noted, Peru did not at that stage make any reference to the argument that
                    the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement applied only to its
                    northern maritime boundary.


                      85. In the view of the Court, there is nothing at all in the terms of the
                    1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement which would limit it

                    only to the Ecuador‑Peru maritime boundary. Moreover Peru did not in
                    practice accord it that limited meaning which would preclude its applica-
                    tion to Peru’s southern maritime boundary with Chile. The Court further
                    notes that the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement was nego-
                    tiated and signed by the representatives of all three States, both in the
                    Commission and at the Inter‑State Conference. All three States then pro-
                    ceeded to ratify it. They included it among the twelve treaties which they
                    jointly submitted to the United Nations Secretariat for registration in
                    1973 (see paragraph 21 above).

                       86. With regard to Peru’s second argument, Chile responds by point-
                    ing out that delay in ratification is common and contends that of itself the
                    delay in ratification has no consequence for the legal effect of a treaty
                    once it has entered into force. Further, it submits that the fact that regis-
                    tration of an Agreement is delayed is of no relevance.

                       87. The Court is of the view that Chile’s delay in ratifying the 1954 Spe-
                    cial Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement and submitting it for registration
                    does not support Peru’s argument that Chile considered that the Agree-
                    ment lacked major importance. In any event, this delay has no bearing on
                    the scope and effect of the Agreement. Once ratified by Chile the Agree-
                    ment became binding on it. In terms of the argument about Chile’s delay
                    in submitting the Agreement for registration, the Court recalls that, in
                    1973, all three States signatory to the 1952 and 1954 treaties, including
                    the 1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement, simultaneously sub-
                    mitted all of them for registration (see paragraphs 20 to 21 above).

                       88. With regard to Peru’s third argument that the 1954 Special Mari-
                    time Frontier Zone Agreement had a special and temporary purpose and
                    that the Parties were claiming a limited functional jurisdiction, Chile’s
                    central contention is that the “basic predicate” of the Agreement was that
                    the three States “already had lateral boundaries, or ‘frontiers’, in place
                    between them” (see paragraph 82 above). The reference in the title of the
                    Agreement to a Special Maritime Frontier Zone and in the recitals to
                    violations of the maritime frontier between adjacent States demonstrates,
                    Chile contends, that a maritime frontier or boundary already existed
                    when the three States concluded the Agreement in December 1954. The
                    granting to small vessels of the benefit of a zone of tolerance was, in terms
                    of the Preamble, intended to avoid “friction between the countries con-
                    cerned, which may affect adversely the spirit of co‑operation and unity
                    which should at all times prevail among the countries signatories to the
                    instruments signed at Santiago”. According to Chile, this was an
                    inter‑State problem and “not a problem relating to itinerant fishermen”.
                    The States wished to eliminate obstacles to their complete co‑operation in
                    defence of their maritime claims. Chile emphasizes that Article 1, the pri-
