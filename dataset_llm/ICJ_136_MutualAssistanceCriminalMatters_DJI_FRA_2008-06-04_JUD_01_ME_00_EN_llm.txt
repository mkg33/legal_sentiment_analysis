link between the two instruments. In this respect, no violation of the
1986 Convention could give rise to any effects under the Treaty of 1977.
   103. France concludes that the principles embodied in the Treaty of
1977 cannot by themselves “give rise to a violation of international law”.
Furthermore, it contends that the manner in which the principles of good
faith and reciprocity are linked to the Treaty is, formally speaking, artifi-
cial, and that the said principles should be examined in relation to specific
obligations which are contained, according to the Application, in the
1986 Convention and not in the Treaty of 1977. France thus addresses
the issue of reciprocity in dealing with the violations of the 1986 Conven-
tion that are alleged by Djibouti.
   104. The Court observes that, notwithstanding the broad intention to
promote mutual respect as described in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1977,
the principal objective of the Treaty is the development of co-operation
in the economic, monetary, social and cultural fields. Its substantive pro-
visions speak of objectives to be attained, friendship to be fostered and
goodwill to be developed. While these provisions refer to the realization
of aspirations, they are not bereft of legal content. The respective obliga-
tions of the Treaty are obligations of law, articulated as obligations of
conduct or, in this case, of co-operation, of a broad and general nature,
committing the Parties to work towards the attainment of certain objec-
tives defined as progress in a variety of fields, as well as in matters relat-
ing to peace and security. These goals are to be achieved by the employ-
ment of certain procedures and institutional arrangements. That France
has ratified the Treaty without finding it necessary to submit it for par-
liamentary approval does not alter the fact that the Treaty creates legal
obligations of the kind just described.


  105. Mutual assistance in criminal matters, the subject regulated by
the 1986 Convention, is not a matter mentioned among the fields of co-
operation enumerated in the Treaty of 1977. Judicial co-operation is

therefore not subject to the undertakings and procedures governed by
Article 3, paragraph 2, and Articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty. Therefore the
question arises whether the Treaty of 1977 can have any juridical impact
on the 1986 Convention, despite the fact that the Convention deals with
a kind of co-operation which is not envisaged in the Treaty of 1977.
  106. In the view of the Applicant, such a relationship between the two
instruments exists in two regards : first, the 1986 Convention on Mutual
Assistance must be construed in the light of the ties of friendship existing
between the Parties to it ; and second, any “serious” violation of the 1986
Convention must be regarded as a “major” violation of the 1977 Treaty
of Friendship.

  107. The Court has had occasion to address similar questions in two
earlier cases. At the merits stage of the case concerning Military and
Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United
States of America), the Court had to determine the purport and scope of
a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation concluded in 1956
between the two States. In its own words,
       “[T]he Court is asked to rule that a State which enters into a
    treaty of friendship binds itself, for so long as the Treaty is in force,
    to abstain from any act towards the other party which could be clas-
    sified as an unfriendly act, even if such act is not in itself the breach
    of an international obligation. Such a duty might of course be
    expressly stipulated in a treaty, or might even emerge as a necessary
    implication from the text ; but as a matter of customary international
    law, it is not clear that the existence of such a far reaching rule is
