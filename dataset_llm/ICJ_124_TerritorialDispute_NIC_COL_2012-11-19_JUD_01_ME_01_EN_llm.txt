                        1. I have voted in favour of all the conclusions of the Court relating to
                     the merits of the dispute as contained in the operative paragraph of the
                     Judgment (paragraph 251, subparagraph (1) and subparagraphs (3)
                     through (6)). However, I have been unable to vote in favour of subpara-
                     graph (2) of the operative paragraph that relates to the issue of admissi-
                     bility of the claim by Nicaragua contained in its final submission I (3). I
                     wish to explain why I believe that the conclusion of the Court on this
                     point is not in line with the criterion for judging admissibility of a claim
                     as developed by the Court and not right as a matter of principle.

                       3. Colombia as Respondent lodged its objection to this, charging that
                     “Nicaragua’s maritime claims, and the basis on which those claims have
                     been formulated, have undergone a radical change at a very late stage





6 CIJ1034.indb 198                                                                                                                              7/01/14 12:43

                     of these proceedings” and that “this has fundamentally changed the
                     ­subject‑matter of the dispute which Nicaragua originally asked the Court to
                      decide” (CR 2012/12, p. 44, para. 2). It elaborated its contention of inad-
                      missibility of the new claim of the Applicant by stating that “Nicaragua
                      has not simply reformulated its claim ; it has changed the very subject‑­
                      matter of the case” (ibid., p. 45, para. 10). It thus suggests that this new
                      position that the Applicant takes in the present case is contrary to Article 40
                      of the Statute and Article 38 of the Rules of Court (ibid., p. 49, para. 32).

                        5. Both the Applicant and the Respondent cite the jurisprudence of
                     this Court principally on the basis of two recent cases before the Court —
                     that is, the case concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru and the
                     case concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo — in order to determine whether
                     or not this allegedly newly formulated claim of the Applicant can be con-
                     sidered admissible. For this purpose, both Parties developed their argu-
                     ments on the basis of the criteria developed by the Court in its
                     jurisprudence on admissibility of a new claim — that is, either the new
                     claim has been implicit in the Application or it arises directly out of the
                     question which is the subject‑matter of the Application.
                        6. In my view it is doubtful whether either of these two cases is strictly
                     pertinent to the present case. In each of these recent cases the alleged new
                     claim advanced at a later stage of the proceedings by the Applicant was,
                     in its essential character, a new additional claim which had not expressly
                     been included in the original Application but which the Applicant
                     claimed — and the Respondent denied — to have been covered by the
                     original claim formulated in the original Application. It is submitted that
                     such is not the situation in the present case. An automatic and mechani-
                     cal application of these precedents thus could miss the essence of the pres-
                     ent case.

                     unique and has no exact jurisprudential precedent of the Court.
                        7. If we try to find an analogous situation in the jurisprudence of the
                     Court, the case which is more akin to the situation in the present case would





6 CIJ1034.indb 200                                                                                      7/01/14 12:43

                     723 	     territorial and maritime dispute (diss. op. owada)

                     be the case concerning Société commerciale de Belgique (Judgment, 1939,
                     P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 78), between Belgium and Greece, which came
                     before the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1939. In this case, the
                     original claim of the Applicant, the Belgian Government, contained in its
                     Application, asked the Court to declare that “the Greek Government, by
                     refusing to carry out the arbitral awards in favour of the Belgian Company,
                     had violated its international obligations” (ibid., p. 170). In its Counter‑­
                     Memorial, the Respondent disputed this allegation that it had refused to
                     carry out the arbitral awards. It advanced the contention that it had neither
                     refused to carry out the awards nor disregarded the acquired rights of the
                     Belgian company, and claimed that it had committed no act which was con-
                     trary to international law. Thereupon, the Applicant decided to treat these
                     declarations of the Greek Government as changing the character of the dis-
                     pute between the two Parties, and, at the conclusion of the oral pleadings,
                     the final submissions of the Belgian Government were given a new form. It
                     now asked the Court to rule that “all the provisions of the awards were bind-
                     ing on the Greek Government without reserve” (ibid., p. 171). No objection
                     was raised by the Respondent to this abandonment by the Applicant of its
                     original submissions which had asked the Court to declare that “the Greek
                     Government . . . had violated its international obligations” (ibid., p. 170) by
                     refusing to pay the arbitral awards in favour of the Belgian company.

                        9. By comparison, it is not possible to find in the present case any such
                     exceptional special circumstances that could justify the drastic change in
                     the character of the claim. What is more pertinent and crucial, the
                     Respondent in the present case raised a strong objection to this novel
                     formulation of the claim advanced by the Applicant at that late stage of
                     the proceedings.

                       12. The present Judgment accepts that
                           “from a formal point of view, the claim made in Nicaragua’s final
                           submission I (3) (requesting the Court to effect a continental shelf
                           boundary dividing by equal parts the overlapping entitlements to a
                           continental shelf of both Parties) is a new claim in relation to the
                           claims presented in the Application and the Memorial” (Judgment,
                           para. 108).
                     It however rejects the contention of Colombia that this revised claim
                     transforms the subject‑matter of the dispute, arguing that “[t]he fact that
                     Nicaragua’s claim to an extended continental shelf is a new claim . . . does
                     not, in itself, render the claim inadmissible” (ibid., para. 109). It cites a
                     dictum from its own Judgment in the case concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo
                     that “the decisive consideration is the nature of the connection between
                     that claim and the one formulated in the Application instituting proceed-
                     ings” (ibid.). Relying largely upon the argument of the Applicant, the





6 CIJ1034.indb 204                                                                                      7/01/14 12:43

                     725 	    territorial and maritime dispute (diss. op. owada)

                     Judgment states that “the Application defined the dispute as ‘a group of
                     related legal issues subsisting between the Republic of Nicaragua and the
                     Republic of Colombia concerning title to territory and maritime delimita-
                     tion’” (Judgment, para. 111). On the basis of this understanding, the
                     Judgment concludes that “the [revised] claim . . . falls within the dispute
                     between the Parties relating to maritime delimitation and cannot be said
                     to transform the subject‑matter of that dispute” (ibid.). I respectfully dif-
                     fer from this perception of the Court about the nature and the
                     ­subject‑matter of the dispute as submitted to the Court by the Applicant.

                     tion. The legal character of a continental shelf based on the distance crite-
                     rion and that of a continental shelf based on the natural prolongation
                     criterion are quite distinct ; thus the rules applicable for determining the
                     continental margin boundary on the basis of the principle of natural pro-
                     longation extending beyond the 200 mile limit of the continental shelf as
                     against the continental shelf determined by the distance criterion of
                     200 nautical miles from the coast of the land territory (United Nations
                     Convention on the Law of the Sea, Art. 76) are entirely distinct and differ-
                     ent from the rules applicable for determining the extent of the continental
                     shelf between the opposite or adjacent states (ibid., Art. 83).
                        15. In effect, what is proposed by the Applicant by way of its newly
                     reformulated submission I (3) is not something that can be characterized
                     as relating only to “the means by which it is suggested to resolve [the dis-
                     pute]” (CR 2012/15, p. 37, para. 9 ; emphasis added).
                        16. With regard to the subject‑matter of the “dispute”, for the resolu-
                     tion of which the newly reformulated claim of an extended continental
                     shelf of Nicaragua is purportedly being advanced, replacing the original
                     request for “a single maritime boundary” (Application, para. 8), it is to
                     be noted that there is no express definition in the Application to indicate





6 CIJ1034.indb 206                                                                                    7/01/14 12:43

                     726 	     territorial and maritime dispute (diss. op. owada)

                     what exactly in the view of the Applicant constitutes the dispute being
                     submitted by the Applicant in the present case, except for several general
                     references to “the dispute”, such as that “[t]he dispute [submitted to the
                     Court] consists of a group of related legal issues . . . concerning title to
                     territory and maritime delimitation” (Application, para. 1). Nowhere in
                     the Application is to be seen what concretely is the dispute that the Appli-
                     cant is envisaging to refer to the Court.
                        It is only when we come to the crucial part of the Application which
                     deals with concrete requests for the Court to adjudge and declare in the
                     present case (ibid., para. 8), that the Application specifically states that :
                           “in the light of the determinations concerning title requested above,
                           the Court is asked further to determine the course of the single mar-
                           itime boundary between the areas of continental shelf and exclusive
                           economic zone appertaining respectively to Nicaragua and Colombia,
                           in accordance with equitable principles and relevant circumstances
                           recognized by general international law as applicable to such a delim-
                           itation of a single maritime boundary”.
                     This language could not be clearer ; its purport is to identify a very spe-
                     cific objective that the Applicant seeks to attain by the Judgment, that is,
                     the determination of the course of a single maritime boundary constitut-
                     ing both the continental shelf boundary and the economic zone bound-
                     ary. It cannot be read as merely indicating one possible means to be
                     employed by the Court for achieving the general objective of demarcating
                     maritime areas lying between the two Parties.

                        19. Having discussed so far in terms of the concrete context of the
                     case, I wish to turn now to what in my view is an even more important
                     point — namely, the consideration of judicial policy of this Court. The
                     present instance of what I believe to be a transformation of the dispute
                     already before the Court into another dispute is different in character
                     from the normal case of procedural irregularities, to which the Court,
                     being an international jurisdiction, can sometimes take a more flexible
                     position. The present case in my view is not a mere matter of procedural
                     formality with only a limited impact on the procedural fairness of the
                     case in issue.

                        20. In the case concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru, the
                     Court took the view that from a formal point of view the additional claim
                     relating to certain outside assets that appeared in the Nauruan Memorial
                     was a new claim as compared with the original claim presented in the
                     Application. Nevertheless, it took the position that it should consider
                     whether, although formally a new claim, this claim could be considered as
                     included in the original claim in substance. In considering this point, the
                     Court took careful account of the position enunciated by the Perma-
                     nent Court of International Justice in an earlier case that “[t]he Court,
                     whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of
                     form the same degree of importance which they might possess in munici-
                     pal law” (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924,
                     P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 34). After an extensive consideration of this
                     point, the Court nonetheless came to the conclusion that “the Nauruan
                     claim . . . is inadmissible inasmuch as it constitutes, both in form and in
                     substance, a new claim, and the subject of the dispute originally submit-
                     ted to the Court would be transformed if it entertained that claim” (Cer‑
                     tain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary
                     Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 267, para. 70).

                     mer issue, relates to the question of geological or geomorphological fea-
                     tures of the maritime areas involved, including the geological nature of
                     the relevant islands, islets, cays and other maritime features in the area.
                     Another difficult question will arise in relation to the unsettled doctrine of
                     how to effect a maritime delimitation of overlapping areas of continental
                     shelf entitlements between two States claimed on the strength of different
                     legal bases by each Party — one claim based on the criterion of natural
                     prolongation extending beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline of
                     the coast, the other based on the criterion of pure distance. No State
                     practice has developed and no jurisprudence exists on this point. Yet
                     another difficulty the Court will have to face is the question of applicabil-
                     ity vel non of the relevant prescriptive conditions contained in UNCLOS,
                     especially its Article 76, to the extent that one of the Parties, Colombia, is
                     not a party to the Convention.

                     ation of legal stability and predictability. This to my mind is an essential
                     point of principle to be emphasized in the present setting as a matter of
                     judicial policy of the Court.
                        24. In light of this situation, it should be no source of surprise to find
                     that the Court in the present Judgment has found, while accepting that the
                     newly reformulated claim of the Applicant is procedurally admissible, that
                     it nonetheless could not entertain the examination of the substantive claim
                     of the Applicant on this point. What the Court decided to do in this Judg-
                     ment, after upholding the procedural admissibility of submission I (3) of
                     the Application, was to engage in the analysis of the essential legal nature
                     of this claim (Part IV), treating it separately from the more general exami-





6 CIJ1034.indb 212                                                                                    7/01/14 12:43

                     nation of the original claim of the Applicant relating to the delimitation of
                     the relevant maritime area between the two opposing States (Part V).
                     Clearly the Court has concluded that the issue now raised by Nicaragua in
                     its final submission I (3) was of such a nature that the Court at this stage
                     of the proceedings should not address it as if it were part and parcel of the
                     general basket of issues relating to the maritime delimitation raised in the
                     Application of Nicaragua. It is in my view for this reason that the Court
                     did not proceed to dispose of this Nicaraguan submission I (3) by simply
                     rejecting it on the basis of inadequacy of evidence produced by Nicaragua.
                     More than the issue of evidence is involved, as is revealed in the treatment
                     of the problem involved in Part IV of the Judgment.
                        25. Reflecting this anomalous situation the present Judgment, while
                     accepting that the reformulated claim of the Applicant is procedurally
                     admissible, analyses the essential legal nature of this claim in an indepen-
                     dent Part IV, in between Part III (which deals with the procedural issue
                     of admissibility of the reformulated claim of the Applicant in I (3) of its
                     final submissions) and Part V (which discusses the general issues of mari-
                     time delimitation). The Judgment treats this as a separate issue from
                     either of the other two issues, arriving at the conclusion that this claim
                     had to be rejected. For this reason, among others, Part IV is kept separate
                     from Part III and Part V.

                        26. This approach adopted in the Judgment would seem to reflect the
                     awareness on the part of the Court of the differences that exist in the legal
                     nature of the two different issues involved in relation to the regions of the
                     continental shelf, as described in paragraph 21 above. This to me is one
                     more reason why the Court should have distanced itself from this newly
                     reformulated claim of Nicaragua by declaring it to be inadmissible in the
                     present proceedings.
