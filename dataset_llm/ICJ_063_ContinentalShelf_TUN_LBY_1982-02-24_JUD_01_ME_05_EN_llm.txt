1. To my profound regret, I find myself unable to share the views of the
Court on many essential points. First of all, the Court fails, in my view, to
arrive at a proper appreciation of the “trends” at the Third United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea, and interprets them simply by looking at
a few provisions now standing in the draft convention. The Court largely
ignores the changes that have occurred in the concept of the continental
shelf and the impact that the new concept of the Exclusive Economic Zone
may have on the exploitation of submarine mineral resources. It will be
surprising to any student of the law of the sea to find that the words
“Exclusive Economic Zone” appear only once in this lengthy Judgment,
and then only in connection with historic sedentary-fishing rights
(para. 100). Secondly, the Court suggests as the positive principles and
rules of international law to apply in this case only equitable principles and
the taking into account of all relevant circumstances (para. 133, A). This
merely amounts to an uninformative rearrangement of the terms of the
main question put to it. It appears simply to suggest the principle of
non-principle. The Judgment does not even attempt to prove how the equi-
distance method, which has often been maintained to embody a rule of law
for delimitation of the continental shelf, would lead to an inequitable
result. Indeed, it gives that method rather short shrift. Furthermore, the
line suggested by the Court in dealing with the practical method to be
employed in application of the (unspecified) principles is not grounded on
any persuasive considerations. It is in particular entirely obscure why it
should feature a veering point at the parallel of the most westerly point on
the coastline of the Gulf of Gabes. The Judgment appears, to my eyes,
simply as one appropriate to a case ex aequo et bono such as might have
been decided, if the Parties so agreed, in accordance with Article 38,
paragraph 2, of the Statute. But the present case is certainly not one of that
kind. Thus I feel bound to submit my own analysis of it, and, since it is my
duty to found my assertions, this will involve going into considerable detail
upon most of the essential points.

Section I. “Trends” as Interpreted by Tunisia and Libya

3. The Court had been requested, under Article 1, paragraph 1, of the
Special Agreement signed by Tunisia and Libya on 10 June 1977, to render
its judgment as to “Quels sont les principes et régles du droit international
qui peuvent être appliqués pour la délimitation” (according to the French
text supplied by Tunisia), or “What principles and rules of international
law may be applied for the delimitation” (according to the English text
furnished by Libya), of the area of the continental shelf appertaining to
Tunisia and the area of the continental shelf appertaining to Libya, and in
rendering its judgment the Court (according to the Tunisian text) is
required “de tenir compte” of equitable principles and the relevant cir-
cumstances which characterize the area, as well as the “tendances récentes
admises”, or (according to the Libyan text), “the Court shall take its
decision according to equitable principles, and the relevant circumstances
which characterize the area, as well as the new accepted trends” in the
Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS HI). I
use these French expressions in addition to the English ones because of
alleged discrepancies between the translations made from the original
Arabic into French by Tunisia and into English by Libya. Putting the last
part first, it seemed clear that it would be indispensable, in ascertaining
“the principles and rules of international law” to apply for the delimitation
of the continental shelf, to take account of “equitable principles” and of
“the relevant circumstances which characterize the area”. However, the
Parties professed to have divergent interpretations of the meaning of the
“tendances récentes admises” or “the new accepted trends” at UNCLOS
III, and of the role these should play in determining the “principles and
rules of international law”.

4. There were certain differences of opinion between Tunisia and Libya
as to how the “tendances récentes admises” or “the new accepted trends”
had taken shape. According to Tunisia, replying to a question I put to the
Parties at the hearing on 9 October 1981 :

the sea. Thus in 1978 (A/CONF.62/62 of 13 April 1978) it decided to
identify the outstanding issues still requiring negotiation, which
signified that any non-contested provision of the Informal Composite
Negotiating Text (ICNT), or any the contestation of which had been
deferred, constituted a trend admitted at that date (which was the case
with the concept of the exclusive economic zone, the régime of islands,
etc.).

The process of identifying the hard-core issues calling for further
negotiation and consultation with a view to reaching compromise
solutions, which would be adopted by consensus or be found gener-
ally acceptable, led to the specification of seven issues of which one
was the delimitation of maritime boundaries between adjacent and
opposite States. This means that Articles 74 and 83 of the 1977 ICNT
did not, at that stage, constitute trends admitted by the Confer-
ence.

The Conference had also laid down a process for the revision of the
1CNT whereby a provision could only be modified if the new wording
were adopted by a consensus or found by the “college” of the Con-
ference to be likely to offer a substantially improved prospect of a
consensus.

Thus this procedure, decided by consensus at a plenary sitting of
the Conference, does not leave any room at all for individual inter-
pretation of what may constitute an admitted trend. It is the Con-
ference itself which decides what is admitted, among the points which
had been left over for discussion, and its decision is expressed in the
form of amendment of the negotiating text, known as the ICNT in the
initial phase and as the draft convention (informal text) in the second
phase. Finally, the officialization of the draft convention decided at
the latest session definitively reinforced and crystallized the trends
admitted within the Conference, which now cover the whole of the
draft.”

Thus Tunisia considered the provisions of the draft convention on the Law
of the Sea (A/CONF.62/L.78) as reinforcing and crystallizing the “ten-
dances récentes admises”. Libya, on the other hand, took the following
view in its reply :


“The process by which new trends were accepted in the conference
was the ‘consensus method’ — which may or may not represent the
position of each State on the point. ‘Consensus’ is a device to permit
an appearance of agreement where voting would not. ‘Consensus’
may be influential in development of a rule of customary interna-
tional law, but adoption of a provision by ‘consensus’ at an interna-
tional conference does not by itself create such a rule.”

160 ‘CONTINENTAL SHELF (DISS. OP. ODA)

Libya thus did not make clear its views on how the draft convention

5. If the trends of UNCLOS III or the provisions of the draft conven-
tion on the Law of the Sea had become established principles and rules of
international law, particularly so far as concerns the delimitation of the
continental shelf, the Court would naturally have been bound to take them
into consideration in its judgment, even if it had not explicitly been asked
to do so by the provisions of the Special Agreement. However, neither
Tunisia nor Libya made the semantically contradictory suggestion that the
“tendances” or “trends” as such formed part of the principles and rules of
international law. Instead, Tunisia stated :

“The Tunisian Government considers that the ‘recent trends admit-
ted’ can form part of the principles and rules of international law zo the
extent that they may already have given rise to a sufficiently abundant
practice to be considered as customary rules.” (Emphasis added.)

Libya, on the other hand, stated :

“ ‘Consensus’ may be influential in development of a rule of cus-
tomary international law, but adoption of a provision by ‘consensus’
at an international conference does not by itself create such a
rule” ;

and

“New accepted trends, within the meaning of Article 1 of the Spe-
cial Agreement, fall within the purview of the principles and rules of
international law for the purposes of that Article only if and so far as
the Court concludes that they are generally accepted by States so as to
have become principles and rules of customary international law.”
(Emphasis added.)

6. If the trends of UNCLOS III or the very provisions of the draft
convention on the Law of the Sea had not achieved the status of established
rules and principles of international law, how should the Court have
taken them into account under the Special Agreement of 1977 ? Tunisia
stated :



“The ‘recent trends admitted’ which have not yet reached the
threshold of customary law are nevertheless to be taken into consid-
eration within the framework of Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Special
Agreement, not as elements of the applicable law, for the two Parties
are in agreement that the reference to these trends does not confer
upon the Court a power to decide ex aequo et bono, but as factors in the
interpretation of the existing rules.”

On the other hand, Libya stated simply: “[I]t is for the Court to decide
what weight should be given to any ‘new accepted trends’.” In view of
these cautious interpretations, and given the care taken by both Parties to
qualify even such limited endorsement as they accord the provisional
results of the Conference, it would seem that the express reference to the
trends of UNCLOS III in the Special Agreement of 1977 did not, in 1981,
have such great significance as is generally thought or may once have been
expected. The Court was not requested in delivering its Judgment to take
the trends of UNCLOS III into account as an element separate from the
principles and rules of international law, but was simply asked to have due
_ regard to those trends as material to aiding an understanding of what the
principles and rules of international law are. Yet it would have been
natural for the Court, even without any request to that effect, to pay due
regard to recent developments seen during the past decade in the course of
the deliberations of the United Nations Sea-bed Committee and UNCLOS
III, which may reflect the principles and rules of international law
today.

7. Furthermore, since some provisions of the draft convention on the
Law of the Sea were often referred to, both in the pleadings and at the

of the law of the sea concerned with lateral delimitation. Such a pro-
nouncement would have involved the Court as a whole in a closer analysis
of prevailing trends than it has seen fit to perform, and such an analysis, as
I see it, ought to have led it to a more fundamental conclusion than
underlies its judgment, and to a correspondingly different approach. As
this analysis is essential to an explanation of my position, I propose to
begin it by first sketching out how the draft convention was prepared.

Section II. The “Consensus” Formula of the Third United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea

8. On 16 November 1973 the United Nations General Assembly, by
General Assembly resolution 3067 (XXVIII), adopted by 117-0-10 votes,
dissolved the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the
Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction
(Sea-bed Committee), which had been functioning for the previous six



years, and confirmed the decision taken by General Assembly resolution
3029 A (XXVII) to hold UNCLOS III from the end of 1973 onwards. In
proposing the draft of this resolution to the Plenary Meeting, the First
Committee on 25 October 1973 approved the following “gentlemen’s
agreement” :

“Recognizing that the Conference at its inaugural session will
adopt... its procedures, including its rules regarding methods of
voting, and bearing in mind that the problems of ocean space are
closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole and the
desirability of adopting a Convention on the Law of the Sea which will
secure the widest possible acceptance,

[The General Assembly] expresses the view that the Conference
should make every effort to reach agreement on substantive matters
by way of consensus ; that there should be no voting on such matters
until all efforts at consensus have been exhausted ; and further
expresses the view that the Conference at its inaugural session will
consider devising appropriate means to that end.” (A/C.1/PV.1936
(provisional).) (Emphasis added.)

February and June 1974 were also in vain. Difficulties mainly concerned
the voting procedure, which, the delegates considered, might determine the
character of the text to be adopted. The rules of procedure, discussions on
which were prolonged for more than a week at the second session in
Caracas, were finally adopted by the Conference on 27 June 1974. Just
before their adoption, Mr. H. S. Amerasinghe, the President of UNCLOS
111, read out the following declaration, which was adopted by consen-
sus :

“Bearing in mind that the problems of ocean space are closely
interrelated and need to be considered as a whole and the desirability
of adopting a convention on the law of the sea which will secure the
widest possible acceptance,

The Conference should make every effort to reach agreement on
substantive matters by way of consensus and there should be no
voting on such matters until all efforts at consensus have been
exhausted.” (UNCLOS III, Official Records, Vol. 1, p. 52.)



Section III. Negotiating Texts

10. In the course of the second session, held in Caracas in 1974, which
was actually the first substantive session, a great number of proposals was
presented on subjects relating to the general problem of the law of the sea.
The Secretariat of the Conference prepared a Working Paper of the Second
Committee : Main Trends, the purpose of which was to “reflect in gen-
erally acceptable formulations the main trends which have emerged from
the proposals submitted” either to the Sea-bed Committee or to the Con-
ference itself and were to form a basis for its future work (A/CONF.62/
C.2/WP.1, UNCLOS III, Official Records, Vol. 111, p. 106).

11. At the third session, in 1975, there were very few official sessions of
either the plenary or the three main committees. On 18 April 1975, the
only day of substantive discussions at the plenary meetings, the President
suggested that the chairmen of the three main committees should each
prepare a single negotiating text covering the subjects entrusted to his
committee, to take account of all the formal and informal discussions held
thus far. It was understood that the texts would not prejudice the position
of any delegation, and would not represent any negotiated text or accepted
compromise, and that they would be a basis for negotiation (UNCLOS III,
Official Records, Vol. IV, p. 26). Thereafter all the efforts of the chairmen
of the three main committees were directed towards the preparation of
such draft articles. Of course individual delegates were likely to have
submitted suggestions for inclusion in these draft articles, but no consul-
tations or negotiations among the delegates, or between the delegates and
the respective chairmen, were reported at all. However, on the final day of
the session, i.e., 9 May 1975, the President stated that the chairmen of the
three main committees had each drafted a single negotiating text (ibid, p.
27). The Informal Single Negotiating Text (ISNT) (A/CONF.62/WP.8 ;
ibid., pp. 137 ff.) was circulated at the close of the session. The ISNT was a
mere compilation of the draft articles prepared and submitted separ-
ately by the chairmen of the three main committees, without even
a continuous through-numbering of the articles belonging to the three
separately prepared parts.

12. A note placed by the President of the Conference at the beginning of
the ISNT explained its character very well :

“In his concluding statement [on 18 April 1975]... the President
stressed that the single text should take account of all the formal and
informal discussions held so far, would be informal in character and
would not prejudice the position of any delegation nor would it
represent any negotiated text or accepted compromise. It should,
therefore, be quite clear that the single negotiating text will serve as a
procedural device and only provide a basis for negotiation. It must not



in any way be regarded as affecting either the status of the proposals
already made by delegations or the right of delegations to submit
amendments or new proposals.” (Ibid. p. 137.)

The introduction to Part II, covering the subjects entrusted to the Second
Committee and written by the Chairman of the Second Committee, reads
in part as follows :

“The particular nature of this text did not allow the retention of all
the trends refiected in document A/CONF.62/C.2/WP.1 [Working
Paper : Main Trends, as referred to in para. 10 above] and in other
proposals submitted either to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National
Jurisdiction or to the Conference. The aim of the Conference in
adopting the new method for the future stage of its work would have
been defeated had all trends been retained in this text. It was possible
to amalgamate some of the alternative formulations but in other cases
it was necessary to choose between conflicting proposals. In certain
cases, a middle course was adopted.

The justification for the task entrusted to me is to be found in the
particular nature of the single negotiating text as defined by the
President and in the need to have a working instrument on the basis of
which the process of negotiations can be intensified. I have endeav-
oured to accomplish this task to the best of my ability and express the
hope that it will fulfil the purposes for which it was requested by the
Conference.” (Ibid., p. 153.)

13. At the beginning of the fourth session, in the spring of 1976, the
President of the Conference indicated that the next step should be the
preparation by the chairmen of the three main committees of a revised
single negotiating text in respect of each of their committees, and that this
revised text would reflect, as far as possible, the result of the informal
negotiations which had already taken place. Almost all the deliberations at
this session were, in fact, held during informal meetings in camera, but
various groups, regional or functional, also held a number of informal
consultations. No report was submitted to the plenary meeting by the
chairmen of the three main committees, and no single report on the work of
the working groups within the main committees is to be found. What is
clear is that on the last day of the session the Revised Single Negotiating
Text (RSNT), consisting of three separate texts, with again separately
numbered articles submitted by each of the three committees, was circu-
lated (A/CONF.62/WP.8/Rev.1 ; UNCLOS III, Official Records, Vol. V,



pp. 125 f.). The note by the President, attached to this text, reads in part as
follows :

“These texts have been prepared entirely on their own responsi-
bility [i.e., that of the chairmen of the three committees] and will have
no other status than that of serving as a basis for continued negoti-
ation without prejudice to the right of any delegation to move any
amendments or to introduce any new proposals. The texts must
not be regarded as committing any delegation or delegations to any
of their provisions.” (Ibid.)

14. During the fifth session, in the summer of 1976, there was not one
official meeting of the Second Committee. All the deliberations concerning
general problems of the law of the sea were held in informal meetings of the
committee or in its negotiating groups. However, the report by the Chair-
man of the Second Committee, presented to the Plenary, reflects a general
idea of the work which had been done in the Second Committee during this
session. Six important subjects were given priority in this session and
entrusted to five different negotiating groups for discussion, among them
being “Definition of the outer edge of the continental margin” and “De-
limitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the
continental shelf between adjacent or opposite States”. (Ibid, Vol. VI,
p- 136.)

15. For the sixth session, in 1977, there are also very few documents
describing the deliberations on the subject, but immediately after the
adjournment of this session the Informal Composite Negotiating Text
(ICNT) (A/CONF.62/WP.10 ; ibid, Vol. VIII) was circulated, in which,
for the first time, articles were consecutively numbered from 1 to 303. A
memorandum by the President of the Conference, attached to the ICNT
reads, in part, as follows :

“It was understood that while the President would be free to proffer
his own suggestions on the proposed provisions of any part of the
composite text, in regard to any matter which fell within the exclusive
domain of a particular chairman that chairman’s judgement as to the
precise formulation to be incorporated in the text should prevail. The
adoption of this procedure was a recognition of the fact that each
chairman was in the best position to determine, having regard to the
negotiations that had taken place, the extent to which changes in his
revised single negotiating text should be made in order to reflect the
progress achieved in the course of negotiations where, in the chair-
man’s opinion, such progress justified changes in the revised single
negotiating text and also to decide, even where the negotiations had
not resulted in substantial agreement, whether such progress as had
been achieved warranted changes which would be conducive to the



ultimate attainment of general agreement. It was also understood
that, so far as issues on which negotiations had not taken place were
concerned, there should be no departure from the revised single
negotiating text unless it was of a consequential character. This
understanding was scrupulously observed in the course of the prepa-
ration of the informal composite negotiating text. There is no ques-
tion, therefore, of joint responsibility being assumed for the provi-
sions of the text by the President and the chairmen of the three
committees. The chairman of each committee bears the full respon-
sibility for those provisions of the informal composite negotiating text
which are the exclusive and special concern of his committee. This is
not an enunciation of a new doctrine of collective irresponsibility.

The Conference also agreed that the composite negotiating text
would be informal in character and would have the same status as the
informal single negotiating text and the revised single negotiating text
and would, therefore, serve purely as a procedural device and only
provide a basis for negotiation without affecting the right of any
delegation to suggest revisions in the search for a consensus. It would
be relevant to recall here the observation made in my proposals
regarding the preparation of this text that it would not have the
character and status of the text which was prepared by the Interna-
tional Law Commission and presented to the Geneva Conference of
1958 and would, therefore, not have the status of a basic proposal that
would stand unless rejected by the requisite majority.

Special attention was given, in the course of the preparation of the
informal composite negotiating text, to the need for co-ordination
between the different parts of the revised single negotiating text where
there appeared to be contradictions or unnecessary repetition.” (A/
CONF.62/WP.10/Add.1 ; ibid., p. 65.)

16. The seventh session in 1978 needed two weeks to agree on the
organization of the work of the session and on 12 April 1978 it adopted the
report of the General Committee (A/CONF.62/61) as amended. (Deci-
sions printed as A/CONF.62/62 ; UNCLOS III, Official Records, Vol. X,
p. 6.) It was agreed that this session should give priority to the identifi-
cation and resolution of the outstanding core issues and that the Confer-
ence should also discuss and resolve all other issues which remained
outstanding. Negotiating groups of limited size, but in which all delega-
tions were free to participate, were established to deal with seven hard-core
issues, which included the subjects “Definition of the outer limits of the
Continental Shelf and the question of payments and contributions with
respect to the exploitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 miles ;
Definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf and the question of
revenue sharing” and “Delimitation of maritime boundaries between
adjacent and opposite States and settlement of disputes thereon”. It was



further agreed that any modifications or revisions of the ICNT should be
made in the following ways :

“10. Any modifications or revisions to be made in the Informal
Composite Negotiating Text should emerge from the negotiations
themselves and should not be introduced on the initiative of any single
person, whether it be the President or a Chairman of a Committee,
unless presented to the Plenary and found, from the widespread and
substantial support prevailing in Plenary, to offer a substantially
improved prospect of a consensus.

11. The revision of the Informal Composite Negotiating Text
should be the collective responsibility of the President and the Chair-
men of the main committees, acting together as a team headed by the
President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee and the Rap-
porteur-General should be associated with the team as the former
should be fully aware of the considerations that determined any
revision and the latter should, ex officio, be kept informed of the
manner in which the Conference has proceeded at all stages.” (A/
CONF.62/62 ; ibid, p. 8.)

17. The seventh session, in the spring of 1978, and the resumed seventh
session, in the summer of 1978, did not succeed in revising the ICNT,
though a number of reports of committees and negotiating groups were
presented at plenary meetings. Apart from the fact that the plenary held
several formal meetings to discuss substantive matters in the spring, most
of the discussions are believed to have taken place either at informal
meetings of the committees or in the negotiating groups. The reports
presented at the plenary meetings indicated that it was extremely difficult
to reach agreement on outstanding issues in any committee or negotiating
group.

18. Towards the end of the eighth session, held in the spring of 1979,
letters from various regional groups were addressed to the President of the
Conference, and several reports of committees and negotiating groups
were presented to the Plenary, which held several formal meetings to deal
with them. At the close of the eighth session, on 27 April 1979, the Presi-
dent and the chairmen of the main committees, together with the Chair-
man of the Drafting Committee and the Rapporteur-General, met, in
conformity with paragraphs 10 and 11 of the decisions taken by the Con-
ference on 12 April 1978 regarding the organization of work, as quoted in
paragraph 16 above, to consider revision of the ICNT. The subject-matter
that the team was expected to deal with was the outcome of the work of the
negotiating groups on certain hard-core issues. According to the explana-
tory memorandum of the President of the Conference attached to the
ICNT/Revision 1 : |



“[The team] . . . recognized that it had to assume the responsibility
of determining what criteria to apply in deciding whether a given text
enjoyed widespread and substantial support in Plenary and, there-
fore, offered a substantially improved prospect of consensus. The
President, it was recalled, had reiterated that the very nature of the
concept of a package deal must mean that no delegation’s position on
a particular issue would be treated as irrevocable until at least all the
elements of the ‘package’ as contemplated had formed the subject of
agreement. Every delegation, therefore, had the right to reserve its
position on any particular issue until it had received satisfaction on
other issues which it considered to be of vital importance to it.

The team recognized that the discussion in Plenary had proceeded
on the basis of the reports made by the Chairmen of Committees and
Negotiating Groups and of the proposals and suggestions placed by
them before the Plenary. In those circumstances, it did not feel
empowered to consider any proposals not covered by these reports for
the purpose of determining whether they commanded sufficient sup-
port in the Plenary to justify their incorporation in any revision at this
stage. The President recalled that he had very clearly stressed in the
Plenary that all outstanding proposals and issues would receive fur-
ther consideration and that the revision contemplated would remain a
negotiating and not a negotiated, text. It was accordingly agreed that
the proper description of the status of the text could best be conveyed
by the title ‘Informal Composite Negotiating Text/Rev.1’.

The team agreed that it was most important that the President
should stress, in this explanatory memorandum, that it had been able
to address itself only to the texts placed before the Plenary by the
respective Chairmen and by the President and that, accordingly, as
the President had already recognized in the Plenary, many issues and
proposals had not yet received adequate consideration and should
form the subject of further negotiation during the resumed session.”
(A/CONF.62/WP.10/Rev.1, pp. 18 f.)

Thus the first revision of the ICNT was prepared as Informal Composite
Negotiating Text/Revision 1 (A/CONF.62/WP.10/Rev.1), on 28 April
1979. Further efforts were made at the resumed eighth session, in the
summer of 1979, when a number of reports were received by the Plenary
from the regional groups and the negotiating groups, as well as from the
committees.

19. At the ninth session, in the spring of 1980, the Conference was able
to carry negotiations to the stage where, after a formal debate in the
Plenary on some reports from various groups, the collegium (previously
called the team) found itself in a position to undertake the second revision,



thus producing Informal Composite Negotiating Text/Revision 2 (A/
CONF.62/WP.10/Rev.2). In the explanatory memorandum by the Presi-
dent of the Conference, it was stated :

“To avoid any misunderstanding as to the status of the second
revision which is now presented, the President would wish to empha-
size that it must be regarded as a negotiating text which provides, in
the best judgement of the collegium, a better basis of negotiation and
one that offers a substantially improved prospect of a consensus.”
(Ibid, p. 22.)

20. During the resumed ninth session, in the summer of 1980, the results
of the negotiations on outstanding issues in the main committee and in the
Plenary were discussed during the general debate, and the collegium took
note of those results and of the statements made in the course of the general
debate. The conclusions reached by the collegium were reflected in the
revision of the ICNT/Revision 2, and the collegium unanimously decided
to adopt the title “Draft Convention (Informal Text)” for this third revi-
sion (A/CONF.62/WP.10/Rev.3). It was stated in the explanatory mem-
orandum by the President that the observations made by him with regard
to the nature of the ICNT/Revision 2 would apply with equal force to this
new text. In other words, the draft convention (Informal Text) was not a
negotiated text but still remained a “negotiating text”, i.e., a basis for
negotiation which had not itself been negotiated, and therefore was not to
be represented as a set of proposals already enjoying a measure of mul-
tilateral acceptance.

Section IV. Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea

21. At the resumed tenth session, in the summer of 1981, the text of the
draft convention was revised as the draft convention on the Law of the Sea
(A/CONF.62/L.78) and the Conference recognized that the text as so
revised would no longer be an informal text. It would now be

“the official Draft Convention, subject to the following three condi-
tions :

First, the door would be kept open for the continuation of consul-
tations and negotiations on certain outstanding issues. The results of
these consultations and negotiations, if they satisfy the criterion in
A/CONF.62/62, will be incorporated in the Draft Convention by the
collegium without the need for formal amendments.

Secondly, the Drafting Committee will complete its work and its
further recommendations, approved by the Informal Plenary, will be
incorporated in the text.

Thirdly, in view of the fact that the process of consultations and



negotiations on certain outstanding issues will continue, the time has,
therefore, not arrived for the application of Rule 33 of the Rules of
Procedure of the Conference. At this stage, delegations will not
be permitted to submit amendments. Formal amendments may
only be submitted after the termination of all negotiations.” (Ibid,

p. xix.)

Thus even the 1981 draft convention is not yet a finalized text to be put
to the Conference at its final stage for adoption.

22. Although the document entitled “Draft Convention on the Law of
the Sea”, which started as a paper suggested by the President of UNCLOS
III, now has the status of an official document of the Conference, the draft
still requires various procedures and ample time before it can eventuate in
treaty law. It is expected that the “informally” edited draft convention on
the Law of the Sea as a whole will be put to a vote or, preferably, adopted
by consensus (or acclamation) at one of the sessions of the Conference to
be held in 1982. Even if the Conference agrees to adopt this comprehensive
text, it will still have to be signed by the plenipotentiary delegates of States.
Even after being signed by States, the Convention must still be ratified in
order to become effective. According to Article 308 of the draft conven-
tion, the Convention will enter into force 12 months after the date of
deposit of the sixtieth instrument of ratification or accession, but of course
this article itself may be changed before being finally adopted by the
Conference. Whether or not the obtaining of the specified number of
ratifications will be difficult was, of course, not a matter for the Court to
estimate. Although there is no doubt that when that number of ratifica-
tions has been obtained the Convention will be binding upon those States
which have ratified or acceded to it, even this does not necessarily mean
that the text of the Convention will then have embodied or crystallized
pre-existing or emergent rules of customary law. (Cf. I.C.J. Reports 1969,
p. 41, para. 69.)

23. It is however possible that, before the draft of a multilateral treaty
becomes effective and binding upon the States parties in accordance with
its final clause, some of its provisions will have become customary inter-
national law through repeated practice by the States concerned. In this
connection, certain provisions of the draft convention, which have been
inherited from the provisions of the 1958 Conventions on the Law of the
Sea, may of course be regarded as already representing customary inter-
national law. In addition, what has been formulated with almost world-
wide co-operation throughout the decade may contribute to the develop-
ment of customary international law, quite apart from the entry into force
of the draft as treaty law. However, the simple fact that the draft conven-
tion was prepared on the basis of the consensus formula adopted at
UNCLOS III, and that this document was formalized at the suggestion of
the President of the Conference and was declared as being no longer an



informal text, can hardly mean that the provisions of the draft convention
are now regarded or should be regarded as reflecting the principles and
rules of international law.

24, In UNCLOS III it was tacitly agreed that all items should be dealt
with as a “package”, and the suggestion of strict adherence to the con-
sensus method as an axiomatic procedure has been closely followed. Such
procedure and method is an experiment without precedent in the history of
international law, and thus UNCLOS III can be described as a great
laboratory or workshop of international law. The experiment started in an
age when the ocean, occupying two-thirds of the globe, which had hitherto
been considered mainly as an area for communication and the transport of
goods between nations, began to attract the interest of all nations as an
arena for the acquisition of natural resources. To the extent that the ocean
was utilized only for purposes of communication and transport, there had
been no cause to exclude interests other than one’s own. In the present day,
however, interests in the resources of the ocean, inevitably reflecting
individual national goals, have become mutually exclusive. In these
changed circumstances, what was really necessary was a new vision of the
ocean to replace the longstanding concept of the freedom of the seas which
had been valid during the age of maritime traffic. In point of fact, all the
efforts deployed in the great workshop of UNCLOS III have been directed
towards constructing an imposing edifice representing a régime of the
ocean likely to be voted into existence irrespective of what it may bode for
the future. Unable to cling to the aim of true world harmony, the delegates
have felt compelled to content themselves with cobbling together a patch-
work of ideas which are not necessarily harmonious. I would be the last
person to underestimate the difficulty of securing acceptance of an entirely
coherent vision, but as the views of some individual nations are bound to
be sacrificed in the end, I have to say that such a sacrifice would only be
worth making for the sake of such a vision.

25. As can be seen from the process whereby the ISNT, the RSNT and
the ICNT were drafted, the draft convention on the Law of the Sea started
as simply a compilation of texts separately presented by the three main
committees of UNCLOS III on their own individual responsibility. In
1975, working in complete isolation, not only from one another but also
from the majority of the member States, each chairman had to prepare the
ISNT as a first draft of the series in the few weeks granted to him. Each
chairman simply borrowed some provisions from the 1958 Conventions on
the Law of the Sea, some of which, on the basis of long-term practice, had
been considered established as customary rules without much reconsider-
ation of their merits, or picked up some completely new institutions, which
being formally or informally presented to the Sea-bed Committee or
UNCLOS III, put forward a political compromise to settle strongly-
opposed national interests which had by that time not received any exten-



sive discussion. Few efforts have been made to align these notions with the
longstanding rules of customary international law, and a somewhat short-
sighted political compromise is reflected in the so-called “package deal”.
This statement of mine is not meant to blame or criticize the persons
engaged in the preparation of the draft at UNCLOS III, but is made simply
to indicate the process of the preparation of the negotiating texts. Thus
while neither collaboration among the main committees nor exhaustive
studies by the delegates had presided over the completion of the first draft,
in other words the ISNT, thereafter efforts to closely examine each pro-
vision were sometimes considered as hampering the progress of the Con-
ference, again because of the “package deal” procedure and the consensus
method. The delegates, discouraged from dealing with the various pro-
posals put before them, and, despite their probably feeling some doubts
and dissatisfaction, had to co-operate for the sake of building up a new
uniform text. Thus we now have the draft convention on the Law of the
Sea. Whether the result produced by this great laboratory of international
law will prove to be really workable is something that will have to be judged
in the future. The Court was not in a position, at least while the experiment
was still going on in the laboratory, to depend on a half-finished product,
and did not have to regard a simple glance at the formulated text of the
draft convention as indicative of established or embryonic principles and
rules of international law.

26. As stated before, there was at least agreement between the two
Parties that the new (UNCLOS) trends could be applicable in the present
case only to the extent that they had become customary international law.
In this light, the above outline and summing up of the UNCLOS process
should suffice to show that the Court did not have to attach great impor-
tance to the actual provisions of the draft convention on the Law of the Sea,
at least at the stage they have reached at the beginning of 1982. Thus the
Court should have sought enlightenment from UNCLOS III not in those
provisions alone, but much rather in the progress of the discussions
underlying them. By the same token, it should have cast the net wider and
based its considerations of trends in the law of the sea over the past few
decades on an altogether broader survey. In order to understand the trends
in the law of the sea over the past few decades, in the context of the present
case, it is extremely important to realize, for one thing, that the concept of
the continental shelf has fluctuated for the past ten years or so and, for
another, that the introduction of the new concept of the exclusive eco-
nomic zone was calculated to have a great impact on the concept of the
continental shelf.


CHAPTER II. THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF

Section I. Early Claims to the Continental Shelf and
Scholarly Views Thereon

1. Pre-history of the claims to the continental shelf

27. To deal with the delimitation of the continental shelf in early 1982,
when the status of the 1981 draft convention on the Law of the Sea is not
yet certain and it cannot, therefore, be regarded as a sure guide, it is
essential to reflect upon how the concept of the continental shelf has
emerged and become established in international law and to plot the curve
of its development. The term “continental shelf” was not unknown even to
lawyers before the Second World War. In the late 1930s, learning that a
foreign fleet might be sent to the Eastern Bering Sea for the scientific
investigation of salmon, the fishing industry on the Pacific coast of the
United States successfully sought to have Bills introduced into Congress
for the extension of the territorial seas, with a view chiefly towards
monopolizing fishing sites. Accordingly a Bill passed by the Senate on
5 May 1938 provided that United States jurisdiction was to extend to all
the waters and submerged land adjacent to the coast of Alaska lying within
the limits of the continental shelf having a depth of water of 100 fathoms
(approximately 200 metres) (US, S.3744, 75th Congress, 3rd Sess. (1938) ;
83 Congressional Records, TV, 4260, 6423). No action was taken on this Bill
by the House of Representatives prior to adjournment. Further Bills were
introduced in both Houses of Congress in order to extend jurisdiction, not
so much in terms of the continental shelf, but rather by reference to certain
geographical features, such as a depth of water of 100 or 200 fathoms.
Nothing came of those Bills either.

28. However, the régime of the continental shelf had never constituted a
part of international law prior to 1945. In this respect, mention should be
made of the arbitral award given by Lord Asquith of Bishopstone in 1951
in a dispute between a British oil company and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi
(International Law Reports, 1951, pp. 144 ff.). The question at issue was
whether the British company which had been granted an exclusive oil con-
cession covering the territory of Abu Dhabi should simultaneously have
been granted an exclusive oil concession covering the continental shelf. The
award rejected the contention of the British company that the concept of
the continental shelf as territory of the coastal State was an accepted fact,
particularly in 1939, when the company had been granted the concession,
and that Abu Dhabi therefore could not grant it to others. This award
clearly indicated the fallacy of considering the continental shelf as belong-
ing ipso jure to the coastal State. It was thus a fortiori impossible to regard
the continental shelf as being ipso facto subject to the jurisdiction of
the coastal State within the ambit of any positive international law.



29. The methods for extracting oil advanced so far in the period after
the Second World War that it became possible to build artificial installa-
tions out to sea. The possibility of exploiting resources, especially petro-
leum, contained in the continental shelf attracted the attention of the
world. A number of States made claims to their offshore submerged areas
with a view to securing the resources contained therein. The United States
proceeded by claiming the submarine areas described in the well-known
Truman Proclamation of 1945 :

“I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America do
hereby proclaim the following policy of the United States of America
with respect to the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the
continental shelf.

Having concern for the urgency of conserving and prudently uti-
lizing its natural resources, the Government of the United States
regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the con-
tinental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the
United States as appertaining to the United States subject to its
jurisdiction and control...”

It was obviously the aim of the United States to prevent other States from
drawing near the United States coast for the purpose of exploiting sub-
marine mineral resources. It was at the same time indicated by the gov-
ernment authorities that, within the meaning of the Proclamation, the term
“continental shelf” applied to areas where the sea-bed lay at depths not
exceeding 100 fathoms. Many other coastal States followed this precedent,
probably because they would have much to gain and nothing to lose by
claiming the resources off their coasts. Some States asserted that the
continental shelf formed part of their national territory ; others claimed a
limited jurisdiction over the shelf for the purposes of exploitation of its
resources ; while still others claimed ownership of the resources contained
in the continental shelf. All these claimants, however, in one way or
another, asserted an exclusive right to certain limited areas of the subsoil
beneath the high seas. The areas defined as being subject to the control of
their respective coastal States were sometimes measured in terms of dis-
tance from the coast. However, the 100-fathom isobath, as employed in the
United States claim, or the 200-metre isobath became commonly under-
stood as being the limit of the continental shelf.

2. Scholarly views on the continental shelf doctrine prior to the 1958 United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea

30. While the concept of the continental shelf was quite new to inter-
national law in the post-war period, there were many arguments about
it among scholars until the Convention on the Continental Shelf was
adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958.
These arguments may have been overtaken by events, but awareness of
them enhances understanding of the basic character of the concept. Views



on the status of submarine areas varied greatly from scholar to scholar.
Some simply took the concept of the continental shelf for granted, while
others used borrowed ideas and views. Perhaps because of their lack of
confidence in formulating a cohesive doctrine, many were content simply
to list the various views on the subject. Hence it was not easy in the
post-war period to glean from any scholar any solidly grounded views
which could properly be considered as valid support for a claim to the
continental shelf. This difficulty was aggravated by the failure of some
publicists to make sufficiently clear distinction between lex lata and lex
ferenda.

31. As often pointed out, there were certain precedents for the exploi-
tation of submarine areas, and some scholars discussed the status of the
latter in this connection. During the last century a coal mine which
extended far out to sea was excavated off the coast of Cornwall. The
decision of Sir John Patteson, arbitrator, in 1856 was that the right to own
all mines and minerals lying under the high seas was vested in the Crown
and, to give effect to the recommendation of the arbitrator, the Cornwall
Submarine Mines Act was enacted in 1858 (21 & 22 Vic., Chap. 109,
p. 624). As another example, the use of the subsoil beneath the sea had
attracted a great deal of attention since the project of building a tunnel
between England and France was first mooted in the 1870s. No question
was raised as to the right of these two countries to build a tunnel under the
high seas. These two examples indicate that there was nothing in interna-
tional law prohibiting the utilization of the subsoil for the purposes of the
exploitation of resources or communication.

In these cases the legal status of the submarine area was never discussed
except in relation to their actual use ; that is, there was no examination of
the concept in the abstract. No claim to anything more than a tunnel or a
mine had ever been asserted in relation to submerged areas. It was well
understood that the jurisdiction of the coastal State could be extended into
the tunnel or the mine, though only so long as they might exist, but that it
would not extend to any of the submarine areas as a whole. It should be
noted that the principle of the occupation of submarine areas as terra
nullius was taken to be applicable only to a coal mine or a tunnel.

32. Oppenheim-Lauterpacht held that the subsoil of the sea could be
occupied only by the construction of a tunnel extending from the territory
of the coastal State (International Law, Vol. I, 8th ed., 1955, p. 630).
The views maintained by Colombos are expressed in his statement that

“[i]t would . . . be unreasonable to withhold recognition of the right of
a littoral State to drive mines or build tunnels in the subsoil, even
when they extend considerably beyond the three-mile limit of terri-
torial waters, provided that they do not affect or endanger the surface
of the sea” (International Law of the Sea, 4th ed., 1959, p. 62).



H. A. Smith understands the principle of occupation to mean the building
of a tunnel or the digging of a coal mine (The Law of the Sea, 3rd ed., 1959,
p. 82). This view was widely held by scholars (such as Kelsen and Gidel)
who concluded that submarine areas were terra nullius. A fair inference to
be drawn from these views was that there was no principle of international
law to prevent the driving of a tunnel or a mine through submarine areas,
and that jurisdiction thereover would be vested exclusively in the exca-
vating State. Those publicists did not seem to have considered the principle
of occupation or control of submarine areas in general, and it is open to
doubt whether their description of submarine areas as terra nullius ever
really reflected the true state of affairs. In any case, explanation of the use
of submarine areas in terms of occupation of terra nullius appears both
superfluous and misleading. The doctrine of occupation in international
law had generally been invoked solely for the exercise of State jurisdiction,
quite independently of simple use of the area. The fact that submarine
areas could be utilized for transportation by means of tunnels and explored
for exploitation by means of mines should not have led to the conclusion
that the entire submarine area could be possessed by a State in terms of the
occupation of terra nullius. If the areas were indeed terra nullius, it might
have been maintained that submarine areas in general would be possessed
by any State, by virtue of contiguity or geographical identity, whenever a
tunnel or a coal mine was constructed. But, so far as we know, few scholars
considered the territoriality of submarine areas in general. Hence it can be
concluded that submarine areas were never viewed as an area, like a
landmass, that could be acquired by a State. These scholars who presup-
posed that the submarine areas were terra nullius seemed to adopt an
incorrect approach to the problem.

33. The claim to the continental shelf initiated by the United States in
1945 was different from certain of the precedents mentioned above, and
was quite unique under international law in the way that not the use of the
specific part of the submarine regions, but the exercise of exclusive juris-
diction over vast areas of the high seas, was claimed by the coastal State for
the purpose of exploiting the mineral resources in the areas beneath
them.

34. Realizing that the doctrine of the continental shelf required theo-
retical underpinning in order to enable the coastal State to reserve to itself
exclusive jurisdiction over the exploitation of submarine mineral re-
sources, some scholars maintained that the continental shelf belonged ipso
jure to the coastal State. This idea of the continental shelf as being ipso jure
subject to the jurisdiction of the coastal State had its roots in the geological
unity or geographical contiguity of the continental shelf in relation to the
coast. Those specialists who favoured this idea, however, were not always
consistent, since they had to attach some legal significance to unilateral
declaratory claims to the continental shelf.



First, according to one view, the submarine shelves were appropriated
by a unilateral proclamation. But, if effective control was required for the
acquisition of a terra nullius, the continental shelf could not have been
possessed by any State, given the then state of development of technology.
Accordingly the concept of notional occupation was introduced. A dif-
ferent view was also suggested, to the effect that, while the continental shelf
was not appropriated by an individual proclamation, customary law had
evolved from the great number of proclamations concerning the shelf. This
doctrine emphasized that, since no objection had been lodged by other
States to dispute such claims, they had been tacitly accepted, effective
control being dispensed with as a pre-requisite to effective appropriation.
Some scholars were of the opinion that the doctrine of the continental
shelf, while not yet expressive of a norm of general customary law, could be
considered as embodying a norm of general customary international law in
fieri, in statu nascendi. Without reference to customary international law, a
similar conclusion was reached by some who maintained that the compe-
tence of the coastal State to regulate the exploitation of natural resources in
the offshore submerged lands was now one of the general principles of law
recognized by civilized nations, and therefore a rule of existing interna-
tional law. These doctrines presupposed a theory of continental shelf rights
based on the contiguity or continuity of the area with the coast, which was,
in fact, obviously something new to international law. Secondly, there was
also a group of scholars who were reluctant to admit that the continental
shelf had so far been subject to the control and regulation of the coastal
State. While not denying the possibility that the continental shelf might be
susceptible to occupation, they did not believe that current attempts at
control were sufficient to meet international standards for the acquisition
of the space. All of those who relied either upon the significance of
proclamations or upon effective occupation seemed to depend, perhaps
subconsciously, on a premise that the space contained within the conti-
nental shelf must be conceived of as terra nullius in the existing interna-
tional legal order. The continental shelf was analogized to a dry landmass
which could be the object of national possession. This premise, by remov-
ing the submarine areas from the sphere of law pertaining to the high seas,
implied that there was a point in time at which the continental shelf ceased
to be terra nullius and became national territory. A number of publicists
had not the slightest doubt of the validity of their own assumption of the
analogy of submarine areas to the landmass.

35. There was, further, a different scholarly view which maintained that
the submarine areas had always been tacitly regarded as an international
realm which could never be possessed by any State. According to it, the
submarine areas, like the superjacent waters, were not terra nullius, and
there was no reason for subjecting the two domains to radically different
régimes. Theoretically, just as each State had been free to catch fish, so it
had always been free to utilize the resources contained in the subsoil under
the high seas, either by “driving out” from the coast under its jurisdiction,



or by installations embedded in the floor of the sea. But no State could
incorporate submarine areas beneath the high seas into its national terri-
tory. It necessarily followed that any doctrine of acquisition or appropria-
tion was a radical break with the traditional development of international
law. It was thus suggested that by introducing the régime of the continental
shelf in the post-war period the attempt was being made to effect a
revolutionary change in the principle of the freedom of the high seas, which
previously had prevented any State from exercising jurisdiction over that
area.

36. I presume that one of the characteristics of the legal doctrine on the
continental shelf advocated by a number of scholars after the Second
World War was that the claim to exclusive control and jurisdiction of the
coastal State over the submarine areas was substituted for the demand for
use of the submarine resources. The doctrine of the continental shelf — that
is, the claim to exclusive control — was restricted by some to the simple
legalization of national exploitation of the shelf’s mineral resources. While
any doctrine which would make it impossible to utilize the natural
resources would certainly be undesirable, it should be noted that the
exploitation of submarine areas beneath the high seas had not been pro-
hibited under international law. The scholars in question simply over-
looked the fact that a régime of the continental shelf would not necessarily
be required for the actual exploitation of submarine areas. Secondly, most
scholars were not fully alert to the fact that exploitation of submarine
resources being conducted in the high seas came under the head of use of
the sea and, while failing to deal with such exploitation in connection with
the régime of the high seas, they tended to discuss simply the status of the
sea-bed or the subsoil for this exploitation. Yet if the resources beneath the
high seas had created any difficulties in international law, this would have
been simply for the reason that the mode of utilization might sometimes
hinder other uses of the seas, such as navigation or fishing.

Section II. Basic Concept of the Continental Shelf in the
1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf

1. Draft prepared by the International Law Commission

37. While the régime of the continental shelf as lex lata had been
discussed by many scholars, primarily from the theoretical point of view,
the United Nations International Law Commission endeavoured to estab-
lish a lex ferenda for the monopolistic exploitation by coastal States of
offshore submarine resources. Since 1950, the question of the continental
shelf had been treated by the Commission as one of the most important
parts of the régime of the high seas. The received concept underlying the
régime of the continental shelf had gone largely unchallenged in the course
of seven years’ debate by the Commission. The Commission never ques-



tioned the advisability of endorsing it as a basis of positive lex ferenda. On
the other hand, the views of the Commission on the outer limit of the
continental shelf fluctuated continually throughout this seven-year period,
and no firm decision could be taken on this point.

38. At its 1950 session, the International Law Commission took the
view that a coastal State could exercise control and jurisdiction over the
sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine area off its coast in order to explore
and exploit the natural resources existing there. It held that the continental
shelf was not to be considered as either res nullius or res communis, and that
the right of a coastal State was independent of the concept of occupa-
tion.

39. The fundamental principle contained in the 1951 draft did not differ
in nature from what had been discussed in 1950, and was stated as fol-
lows :

“Article 2

The continental shelf is subject to the exercise by the coastal State
of control and jurisdiction for the purpose of exploring it and exploit-
ing its natural resources.” (International Law Commission Yearbook,
1951, Vol. II, p. 141.)

Thus the exercise of control and jurisdiction for the purpose of exploring
the continental shelf and exploiting its natural resources was held to fall
within the competence of each coastal State. The Commission, however,
remained consistent in excluding the treatment of submarine areas as res
nullius, hence in defining the right of the coastal State over the continental
shelf without reference to the notion of occupation or any formal assertion
by the sovereign State. It further rejected the proposition that any number
of proclamations over the previous decade would have created new cus-
tomary law. It took the position that

“[i]t is sufficient to say that the principal of the continental shelf is
based upon general principles of law which serve the present-day
needs of the international community” (ibid, p. 142).

In the 1951 draft the continental shelf was defined as covering submarine
areas “where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation
of natural resources of the sea-bed and subsoil”. The Commission con-
sidered that “technical developments in the near future might make it
possible to exploit resources of the sea-bed at a depth of over 200 metres”,
and, moreover, that

“the continental shelf might well include submarine areas lying at a
depth of over 200 metres but capable of being exploited by means of



installations erected in neighbouring areas where the depth does not
exceed this limit” (International Law Commission Yearbook, 1951,
Vol. IL, p. 141).

40. In its 1953 draft, however, the International Law Commission,
mindful of the need for clear definition of the outer limit of the continental
shelf, adopted a depth of 200 metres as the sole criterion, taking the view
that “the text previously adopted does not satisfy the requirement of
certainty and . . . is calculated to give rise to disputes” (International Law
Commission Yearbook, 1953, p. 213). For the rest, the 1953 draft followed
the basic idea adopted in 1951, except that the right of control and juris-
diction was replaced by “sovereign rights”, and Article 2 was accordingly
framed in the following terms :

“The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign
rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural re-
sources.” (Ibid, Vol. TI, p. 212.)

41. In its 1956 final draft the Commission reaffirmed this basic concept
of sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring the continental shelf and
exploiting its natural resources, and retained the last-mentioned position,
in identical terms, as Article 68 (International Law Commission Yearbook,
1956, Vol. II, p. 264). It was understood that the rights conferred upon the
coastal State covered all rights necessary for and connected with the
exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental
shelf and that such rights included jurisdiction in connection with the
prevention and punishment of violations of the law. The rights of the
coastal State were to be exclusive in the sense that, if it did not exploit the
continental shelf, it was only with its consent that anyone else might do so.
The following views expressed by the Commission in 1956 are worth
quoting in order properly to understand the fundamental concept of the
continental shelf :

“(7) The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not
depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express pro-
clamation.

(8) The Commission does not deem it necessary to expatiate on the
question of the nature and legal basis of the sovereign rights attributed
to the coastal State. The considerations relevant to this matter cannot
be reduced to a single factor. In particular, it is not possible to base the
sovereign rights of the coastal State exclusively on recent practice, for
there is no question in the present case of giving the authority of a legal
rule to a unilateral practice resting solely upon the will of the States
concerned. However, that practice itself is considered by the Com-
mission to be supported by considerations of law and of fact. In
particular, once the seabed and the subsoil have become an object of
active interest to coastal States with a view to the exploration and
exploitation of their resources, they cannot be considered as res nul-



lius, i.e., capable of being appropriated by the first occupier. It is
natural that coastal States should resist any such solution. Moreover,
in most cases the effective exploitation of natural resources must
presuppose the existence of installations on the territory of the coastal
State. Neither is it possible to disregard the geographical phenomenon
whatever the term — propinquity, contiguity, geographical continuity,
appurtenance or identity — used to define the relationship between
the submarine areas in question and the adjacent non-submerged
land. All these considerations of general utility provide a sufficient
basis for the principle of the sovereign rights of the coastal State as
now formulated by the Commission.” (International Law Commission
Yearbook, 1956, Vol. II, p. 298.)

With regard to the outer limit of the continental shelf, however, the
Commission’s draft was again revised in 1956 so as to cover not only areas
within the 200-metre isobath but also areas outside it, provided that
exploitation of the natural resources there remained feasible :

“Article 67

[T]he term ‘continental shelf’ is used as referring to the seabed and
subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the
area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres (approximately 100
fathoms) or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent
waters admits of exploitation of the natural resources of the said
areas.” (Ibid, p. 264.)

2. The régime of the continental shelf adopted in the 1958 Convention on the
Continental Shelf

42. At the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea of 1958, most, but
certainly not all, States entered upon the deliberations without questioning
the global concept of the continental shelf, and any argument regarding the
fundamental status of this submerged area was soon dropped. Whether the
right to be vested in the coastal State should be sovereign or exclusive was
strenuously debated. The most important question, however, related not to
the formal description but to the substance of that right. The provision of
the draft of the International Law Commission was taken as it stood in
Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Continental Shelf, so we
again find : :

“The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign
rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural
resources.”



43. However, a few new paragraphs were added to this basic concept of
the continental shelf during the deliberations of the Conference. Para-
graph 3 as it now stands was introduced at the suggestion of Cuba and was
adopted by 41-7-12 votes at the Fourth Committee ; it had, however,
already been clearly stated in the 1956 commentary on the Commission’s
draft. Article 2, paragraph 3, thus now reads as follows :

“The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not
depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express pro-
clamation.”

Article 2, paragraph 2, states :

“The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are exclusive in
the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf
or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities,
or make a claim to the continental shelf, without the express consent
of the coastal State.”

This paragraph was based on an Argentine proposal already adumbrated
in the commentary on the 1956 draft and adopted by a 36-6-25 vote, and to
a certain extent on a Yugoslav suggestion, adopted by 37-5-24. It might
well be said, however, that the Yugoslav intention was not properly
reflected because its proposal had been to the effect that “if the coastal
State does not exercise the rights under paragraph 1, . . . no one may claim to
its continental shelf without its express agreement” (emphasis added).
Only the latter part of the Yugoslav proposal was incorporated by the
Drafting Committee into the text of the Convention. It appears that this
error in drafting was due to the fact that in the minds of many delegates the
concept of the right of each coastal State over the continental shelf had
become limited to the sole notion of active exploration and exploitation of
the shelf’s resources. At any rate, it is submitted that paragraph 2 should be
interpreted as meaning that anyone is prevented from exploiting the
resources contained in the continental shelf off the coast of the State
without the express consent of that State, and that any State is prevented
from claiming title to this continental shelf in terms of prescription or
occupation or for any other reason, even in the case where the coastal State
has not undertaken any exploitation of these resources.

44. The 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf paved the way to
control of the continental shelf. There was some doubt whether this Con-
vention had simply codified existing customary rules or promulgated a
new legal norm. However, it had certainly disposed of various theoretical
controversies concerning individual claims by many States to submarine
areas off their shores.

45. With regard to the outer limit of the continental shelf, France,
Greece, Italy and the United States of America at the 1958 Conference had
hesitated to accept the provision that the limit of the continental shelf be



measured by such an uncertain criterion as “exploitability”. They had
favoured the depth of 200 metres, but a proposal by France to this effect
(A/CONF.13/C.4/L.7) was rejected. Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom,
India, Canada and the Netherlands had proposed that it might be pref-
erable to specify a depth-line of 550 metres, as being nearer to the deepest
edge of the continental shelf and more likely to result in an agreement
which could remain unaltered for a considerable period (A/CONF.13/
C.4/L.12 as amended, L.24/Rev.1, L.29/Rev.1, L.30 as amended, L.32);
their proposals were, however, either withdrawn or rejected. On the other
hand, the proposal of the Republic of Korea, simply suggesting the “ex-
ploitability” criterion (A/CONF.13/C.4/L.11), and that of Panama, sug-
gesting inclusion of the continental slope within the definition of the
continental shelf (A/CONF.13/C.4/L.4), were both also rejected. Finally,
the original draft prepared by the International Law Commission, with an
additional clause concerning an island (which will be explained later in
para. 149), was adopted, 51-9-10. France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
Netherlands opposed the original draft. Again, at the plenary meeting, the
French delegate tried to remove the concept of exploitability from the
original text, but in vain. Thus the width of the continental shelf was
provided for as follows :

“Article I

... the term ‘continental shelf’ is used as referring (a) to the seabed
and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside
the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that
limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the
exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas; (b) to the
seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of
islands.”

46. It must be said that the reference to the “exploitability” concept had
been so framed as to express the very opposite of the Conference’s inten-
tion, which had clearly been to sanction extension of the limit of the (legal)
shelf beyond the 200-metre isobath to where the depth of the superjacent
waters ceased to admit of the exploitation of the natural resources. How-
ever, even on that reading, much ambiguity remained over the interpre-
tation of the criterion of exploitability. There was insufficient realization
of the consequences of the fact that each coastal State was free to grant to
any foreign country or foreign nationals the right to explore its continental
shelf or to exploit the natural resources therein contained. Hence coastal
States without sufficiently advanced technology could always encourage
foreign investment or technical assistance with a view to exploration and
exploitation of the resources contained within the continental shelf, their
claim to which, beyond the 200-metre isobath, would thus be ipso facto
substantiated. Thus understood, the concept of exploitability had to be
continuously reinterpreted in terms of the most advanced standards of



technology in the world. The logical outcome of this is, finally, that the
exploitation of submarine resources beyond even the 200-metre depth
must always be reserved to “the coastal State”, which is empowered to
claim any area where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of
exploitation. Implicitly, therefore, all the submarine areas of the world
were divided among the coastal States by this 1958 Convention on the
Continental Shelf. Solely the problem of delimitation remained. It is
unlikely that such an interpretation was what the delegates at the Con-
ference actually thought they were approving. Generally speaking, most of
them seem to have been under an erroneous impression that thanks to this
exploitability test, exploration and exploitation beyond the 200-metre
isobath would only gradually become permissible in parallal with the
progress of marine technologies.

Section III. Development of Ideas concerning
Delimitation of the Continental Shelf

1. Draft prepared by the International Law Commission

47. In order to understand the proper method for delimitation of the
continental shelf in the case of adjacent or opposite States, as provided for
in the Convention on the Continental Shelf, we have to return to the 1945
Truman Proclamation, which stated :

“In cases where the continental shelf extends to the shores of
another State, or is shared with an adjacent State, the boundary shall
be determined by the United States and the State concerned in
accordance with equitable principles.”

“Equitable principles” in relation to delimitation of the continental shelf
of opposite or adjacent States were mentioned in several of the unilateral
declarations subsequently made by States.

48. At its second session, in 1950, the International Law Commission
agreed that boundaries should be established where two or more neigh-
bouring States were interested in the same continental shelf. The draft
prepared in 1951 contained the following provision :

“Article 7

Two or more States to whose territories the same continental shelf is
contiguous should establish boundaries in the area of the continental
shelf by agreement. Failing agreement, the parties are under the
obligation to have the boundaries fixed by arbitration.” (International
Law Commission Yearbook, 1951, Vol. II, p. 143.)

It was also proposed that, if agreement were not reached and a prompt
solution was needed, the interested States should be under an obligation to



submit to arbitration ex aequo et bono. The term “arbitration” was used in
the widest sense and included possible recourse to the International Court
of Justice. Meeting objections raised by some governments, Professor
J. P. A. François, Special Rapporteur on this subject in the International
Law Commission, was inclined to replace arbitration ex aequo et bono
by the procedure of conciliation, and thus suggested the following provi-
sion :
“Article 7

Two or more States to whose territories the same continental shelf
is contiguous should establish boundaries in the area of the conti-
nental shelf by agreement. Failing agreement, the parties are under
the obligation to submit the dispute to conciliation procedure.”
(A/CN.4/60, p. 129.)

49. The Committee of Experts on Certain Technical Questions con-
cerning the Territorial Sea met in April 1953 in response to the request by
the Special Rapporteur. The question put by the Special Rapporteur was as
follows :

“How should the (lateral) boundary line be drawn through the
adjoining territorial sea of two adjacent States ? Should this be
done

A. By continuing the land frontier ?

B. By a perpendicular line on the coast at the intersection of the land
frontier and the coastline ?

C. By a line drawn vertically on the general direction of the coast-
line ?

D. By a median line ? If so, how should this line be drawn ? To what

extent should islands, shallow waters and navigation channels be

accounted for 7” (A/CN.4/61/Add.1, English Annex, p. 6.)

The reply to this question by the Committee of Experts was as follows :

“1. After thoroughly discussing different methods the Committee
decided that the (lateral) boundary through the territorial sea — if not
already fixed otherwise — should be drawn according to the principle
of equidistance from the respective coastlines.

2. In a number of cases this may not lead to an equitable solution,
which should be then arrived at by negotiation.” (Ibid, pp. 6 f.)

In this connection the Committee of Experts made the following obser-
vations :

“The Committee considered it important to find a formula for
drawing the international boundaries in the territorial waters of



States, which could also be used for the delimitation of the respective
continental shelves of two States bordering the same continental
shelf.” (Ibid, p. 7.)

In parentheses, the narrative must here be interrupted in order to point out
that the Court, in the present Judgment (see para. 119) seems to have
overlooked the conclusions of this Committee by simply stressing the
questions which that body had had put to it by the Special Rapporteur of
the International Law Commission.

50. In 1953, the International Law Commission, apparently on the basis
of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts, proposed the for-
mulation of a general rule based on the principle of equidistance, recog-
nizing that, while that principle was to provide the general rule, it would be
subject to modification in cases where another boundary line was justified
by special circumstances. The text suggested by the Commission in 1953
for the case of adjacent States was as follows :

“Article 7

1. [The case of opposite States]

2. Where the same continental shelf is contiguous to the territories
of two adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf apper-
taining to such States is, in the absence of agreement between those
States or unless another boundary line is justified by special circum-
stances, determined by application of the principle of equidistance
from the base lines from which the width of the territorial sea of each
of the two countries is measured.” (International Law Commission
Yearbook, 1953, Vol. IL, p. 213.)

The commentary by the Commission on this provision reads as fol-
lows :

“[W]hile . . . the rule of equidistance is the general rule, it is subject
to modification in cases in which another boundary line is justified by
special circumstances. As in the case of the boundaries of coastal
waters, provision must be made for departures necessitated by any
exceptional configuration of the coast as well as the presence of
islands or of navigable channels. To that extent the rule adopted
partakes of some elasticity.” (Ibid, p. 216.)

51. The International Law Commission further revised the text in 1956,
as follows :

“Article 72

1. [The case of opposite States]

2. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of
two adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be
determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agreement,



and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances,
the boundary shall be determined by application of the principle of
equidistance from the baselines from which the breadth of the terri-
torial sea of each of the two countries is measured.” (International
Law Commission Yearbook, 1956, Vol. II, p. 264.)

The commentary attached to the provision stated :

“As in the case of the boundaries of the territorial sea, provision
must be made for departures necessitated by any exceptional con-
figuration of the coast, as well as the presence of islands or of navi-
gable channels. This case may arise fairly often, so that the rule adop-
ted is fairly elastic.” (Ibid, p. 300.)

The International Law Commission also proposed, in Article 73 of the
draft, that any dispute arising out of the interpretation or application of the
régime of the continental shelf should, in principle, be submitted to the
International Court of Justice.

2. Article 6 of the Convention on the Continental Shelf

52. At the Geneva Conference in 1958, Venezuela could not accept the
idea that, if there were no agreement, the boundary line should, as a general
rule, be the equidistance line, because the situations which existed in
different parts of the world were too various to justify the adoption of any
such general rule. Accordingly, Venezuela suggested that “the boundary of
the continental shelf . . . shall be determined by agreement between them
or by other means recognized in international law” (A/CONF.13/C.4/
L.42). For different reasons, Yugoslavia proposed deletion of the words
“and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances”
from the 1956 draft (A/CONF.13/C.4/L.16) because, according to it, that
criterion was vague and arbitrary and likely to give rise to misunderstand-
ing and disagreement. The Yugoslav delegate asked whether, and how,
such special circumstances were enumerated in international law, and who
should be charged with interpreting their application. The proposals of
both Venezuela and Yugoslavia were rejected by the Fourth Committee.
The United Kingdom proposed the following provision :

“In the case of adjacent States, the boundary of the submarine
areas . . . shall, in the absence of agreement on any other boundary, be
determined by the application of the principles of equidistance from
the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the
territorial sea of each of the two States is measured.” (A/CONF.13/
C.4/L.28.)

According to the British delegation —

“[T]he median line would always provide the basis for delimitation.
If both the States involved were satisfied with the boundary provided
by the median line, no further negotiation would be necessary ; if a




divergence from the median line appeared to be indicated by special
circumstances, another boundary could be established by negotiation,
but the median line would still serve as the starting point.” (UNCLOS
I, Official Records, Vol. VI, p. 92.)

After some queries had been raised by France and the Netherlands as to
whether such agreements would be limited to cases where there were
special circumstances, the United Kingdom proposal was withdrawn in
favour of the Netherlands proposal, in which the United Kingdom joined
as co-sponsor (A/CONF.13/C.4/L.23). This joint proposal was in fact
substantially identical with the relevant provision of the 1956 draft of the
International Law Commission and was finally adopted by the Fourth
Committee by 29-16-9 votes. Thus Article 6 of the Continental Shelf
Convention came into being.

“Article 6

1. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of
two or more States whose coasts are opposite to each other, the
boundary of the continental shelf appertaining to such States shall be
determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agreement,
and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances,
the boundary is the median line, every point of which is equidistant
from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the
territorial sea of each State is measured.

2. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of
two adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be
determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agree-
ment, and unless another boundary line is justified by special cir-
cumstances, the boundary shall be determined by application
of the principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the base-
lines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is
measured...”

53. Some suggestions were made during the 1958 Conference as to what
“special circumstances” would mean in this context. The United Kingdom
explained that —


“Among the special circumstances which might exist there was, for
example, the presence of a small or large island in the area to be
apportioned ; he suggested that, for the purposes of drawing a boun-
dary, islands should be treated on their merits, very small islands or
sand cays on a continuous continental shelf and outside the belts of
territorial sea being neglected as base points for measurement and
having only their own appropriate territorial sea. Other types of
special circumstances were the possession by one of the two States
concerned of special mineral exploitation rights or fishery rights, or
the presence of a navigable channel ; in all such cases, a deviation


from the median line would be justified, but the median line would
still provide the best starting point for negotiations.” (UNCLOS I,
Official Records, Vol. VI, p. 93.)

Although restricted to the case of opposite States, there was also a proposal
by Italy, which read as follows :

“Where in the proximity of coasts which are opposite to each other
there are islands belonging to the said continuous continental shelf, in
the absence of agreement, the boundary is the median line every point
of which is equidistant from the low-water line along the coast of the
said States, unless some other method of drawing the said median
line is justified by special circumstances.” (A/CONF.13/C.4/L.25/
Rev.1.)

This Italian proposal was rejected by 3-31-18 votes at the Fourth Com-
mittee. No other argument is to be found in the records of the Conference
on what the “special circumstances” could be which might justify a line
other than the equidistance line.

54. With regard to the compulsory settlement by the International
Court of Justice of any dispute concerning the continental shelf, the
Netherlands suggested that the following clause be added :

“In the case of judicial proceedings relating to the application of
Article 72, the [International] Court [of Justice] shall have power to
decide ex aequo et bono whether a boundary line other than that
defined in that article is justified by special circumstances.” (A/

This provision was adopted by the Fourth Committee following a roll-call
vote of 33-15-14. Both Tunisia and Libya abstained from voting. At the
plenary meeting, this provision was put to a vote only after the Optional
Protocol of Signature concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes
had been adopted and, though obtaining 38-20-7 votes, it was rejected as it
had failed to achieve the required majority of two-thirds of the Conference.
Thus, contrary to the original intention of the International Law Com-
mission, the settlement of disputes concerning the delimitation of the
continental shelf did not become subject to compulsory settlement, either
by the International Court of Justice or by any other means, under the
Convention on the Continental Shelf, in that compulsory settlement was
provided for only in a seperate instrument : the Optional Protocol. In fact,
though the Convention on the Continental Shelf came into force on
10 June 1964, the Optional Protocol had not yet become effective.



55. Thus the Convention on the Continental Shelf suggests the deter-
mination of the boundary of the continental shelf between opposite or
adjacent States by agreement, without providing for any compulsory set-
tlement of disputes. In so doing, it confers on a principle of general law,
concerning the settlement of disputes, priority over any principles or rules
that may be applicable to the particular subject-matter, without saying
what those may be. Thus there is no compelling principle of delimitation
which must be respected by the terms of such agreement as may be
reached. Hence the Convention refrains from mentioning any specific
principle or rule until it comes to the event of failure to agree. But this, in
my view, does not mean that the Conference intended deliberately to
belittle the importance of such principles or rules during the process of
reaching agreement. On the contrary, considering that it must have had
some doctrinal basis for the second sentence of each paragraph of Arti-
cle 6, I suggest that the Conference meant to provide guidance both before
as well as after the ascertainment of any failure to agree (both being phases
in which there is an “absence of agreement”). The implicit intention of
Article 6 was therefore, I believe, most probably to the following effect :
whether in the case of agreement or impartial third-party determination,
the principles and rules of international law to be applied should be that,
unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the
boundary in the case of adjacent States should be determined by appli-
cation of the equidistance principle. In other words, the Convention may
be interpreted to mean that it suggested the “equidistance/special-circum-
stances” method as a normal basis of agreement as well as of third-party
determination. Certainly some difficulties still remain in determining
whether another boundary line is justified by special circumstances or not,
and this too should have been a matter for negotiation between the parties
or for decision by a third party. This applies with particular force if there
does not exist any established rule as to what is meant by “special cir-
cumstances”.

Section IV. Significance of the 1969 Judgment of the Court

1. The continental shelf as a rule of customary international law

56. The argument as to whether the concept of the continental shelf was
valid only as between States parties to the 1958 Convention on the Con-
tinental Shelf, which became effective on 10 June 1964, or had been gen-
erally accepted as customary international law, was ended by the Judg-
ment of the Court in 1969, when the Court stated that :

“19. ... [T]he rights of the coastal State in respect of the area of
continental shelf that constitutes a natural prolongation of its land
territory into and under the === exist ipso facto and ab initio, by virtue
of its sovereignty over the land, and as an extension of it in an exercise



of sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring the seabed and
exploiting its natural resources.” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 22.)

The concept of the continental shelf was thus given a firm place in the
framework of customary international law. However, it is extremely
important to note that the substance or content of the rights enjoyed by the
coastal State were not newly fashioned by the 1969 Judgment. The Court
qualified the rights of the coastal States, in the same way as provided in the
Convention, stating as follows :

“19... .In short, there is here an inherent right. In order to exercise
it, no special legal process has to be gone through, nor have any special
legal acts to be performed. Its existence can be declared . . . but does
not need to be constituted. Furthermore, the right does not depend on
its being exercised. To echo the language of the Geneva Convention, it
is ‘exclusive’ in the sense that if the coastal State does not choose to
explore or exploit the areas of shelf appertaining to it, that is its own
affair, but no one else may do so without its express consent.”
(Ibid)

57. The phrase “ipso facto and ab initio” should not be interpreted as
meaning anything other than what is expressed in the 1958 Convention. In
spite of this phrase, such a right of the coastal State, not being effective
retroactively, did not exist “ipso facto and ab initio” prior to the time when
the régime of the continental shelf found itself in the realm of customary
international law. The Court did not give any additional interpretation to
the concept of the continental shelf, but simply declared the right defined
by the 1958 Convention to be one established under customary interna-
tional law without necessarily depending upon the specific provisions of
that Convention. The concepts of “ipso facto and ab initio” were employed
by the Court in 1969 simply to strengthen the régime of the continental
shelf, which had not yet achieved a firm status in international law. The
Court observed :

“100. . .. This régime furnishes an example of a legal theory derived
from a particular source that has secured a general following. As the
Court has recalled in the first part of its Judgment, it was the Truman
Proclamation of 28 September 1945 which was at the origin of the
theory, whose special features reflect that origin. It would therefore
not be in harmony with this history to over-systematize a pragmatic
construct the developments of which have occurred within a relatively
short space of time.” (Ibid, p. 53.)

The Court stated, as quoted above, the concept that “the continental shelf
.. . constitutes a natural prolongation of its land territory into and under
the sea” and repeated that the “shelf area is the natural prolongation [of the
land domain] into and under the sea” (para. 39). It also talked of “the more
fundamental concept of the continental shelf as being the natural prolon-



gation of the land domain” (para. 40), and of “the natural prolongation of
continuation of the land territory or domain, or land sovereignty of the
coastal State, into and under the high seas via the bed . . .” (para. 43). In the
context of the 1969 Judgment the outer limit of the continental shelf was
not at issue, the North Sea being a shallow sea with the exception of the
(irrelevant) Norwegian Trough, and thus the area beyond the 200-metre
depth of water was not dealt with at that time. Just as the 1958 Convention
on the Continental Shelf did not reveal any precise idea as to the outer limit
of the continental shelf, so the 1969 Judgment did not attempt to define the
outer limit, or the full expanse of the continental shelf, by use of the
concept of “natural prolongation”. No, that concept was used simply
to justify the appurtenance to the coastal State of the continental shelf
geographically adjacent to it.

58. In this connection I would further point out that the fact that the
continental shelf was given a firm place in the framework of customary
international law did not necessarily mean that the actual provisions of the
Convention on the Continental Shelf reflected customary international
law. In its 1969 Judgment, the Court, partly for the reason that reservation
may not be allowed for Articles 1-3 of the Convention, held the view that —

“63. ... [T]hese three articles [Articles 1-3] [are] the ones which, it is
clear, were then regarded as reflecting, or as crystallizing, received or
at least emergent rules of customary international law relevant to the
continental shelf, amongst them the question of the seaward extent of
the shelf ; the juridical character of the coastal State’s entitlement ;
the nature of the rights exercisable ; the kind of natural resources to
which these relate ; and the preservation intact of the legal status as
high seas of the waters over the shelf, and the legal status of the
superjacent air-space.” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 39.)

I submit that this statement went too far in saying that “received or at least
emergent rules of customary international law” had appeared not only
with regard to the juridical character of the coastal State’s entitlement and
the nature of the rights exercisable, but also with regard to some other
aspects. I shall have occasion below to refer to the problem regarding the
kind of natural resources to which these rights relate.

2. Meaning of Article 6 of the Convention on the Continental Shelf

59. The Court stated in its 1969 Judgment that Article 6 of the Con-
vention on the Continental Shelf, which provides for the application of the
principle of equidistance in the case of another boundary not being jus-
tified by special circumstances, did not embody or crystallize any pre-
existing emergent rule of customary law and could not be binding upon the
States which were not parties to the Convention (ibid, p. 41, para. 69).
The Court stated as follows :




“55... .[I}tis clear that at no time was the notion of equidistance as
an inherent necessity of continental shelf doctrine entertained. Quite
a different outlook was indeed manifested from the start in current
legal thinking.” (7.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 35.)

It was further of the view that —

“S8.... But in fact, whereas a median line divides equally between
the two opposite countries areas that can be regarded as being the
natural prolongation of the territory of each of them, a lateral equi-
distance line often leaves to one of the States concerned areas that are
a natural prolongation of the territory of the other.” (Ibid, p. 37.)

Minimizing the meaning of the principle of equidistance as provided for in
Article 6 of the Convention, the Court seemed to find significance in the
requirement of agreement between the parties and in equitable principles,
both of which are also provided for in Article 6 of the Convention. The
Court stated :


“55... . It was, and it really remained to the end, governed by two
beliefs ; — namely, first, that no one single method of delimitation was
likely to prove satisfactory in all circumstances, and that delimitation
should, therefore, be carried out by agreement (or by reference to
arbitration) ; and secondly, that it should be effected on equitable
principles. It was in pursuance of the first of these beliefs that in the
draft that emerged as Article 6 of the Geneva Convention, the [In-
ternational Law] Commission gave priority to delimitation by agree-
ment, — and in pursuance of the second that it introduced the excep-
tion in favour of ‘special circumstances’. Yet the record shows that,
even with these mitigations, doubts persisted, particularly as to
whether the equidistance principle would in all cases prove equi-
table.” (Ibid., pp. 35 f.)

“72... . In the first place, Article 6 is so framed as to put second the
obligation to make use of the equidistance method, causing it to come
after a primary obligation to effect delimitation by agreement. Such a
primary obligation constitutes an unusual preface to what is claimed
to be a potential general rule of law. Without attempting to enter into,
still less pronounce upon any question of jus cogens, it is well under-
stood that, in practice, rules of international law can, by agreement, be
derogated from in particular cases, or as between particular parties, —
but this is not normally the subject of any express provision, as it is in
Article 6 of the Geneva Convention. Secondly the part played by the
notion of special circumstances relative to the principle of equidis-
tance as embodied in Article 6, and the very considerable, still unre-
solved controversies as to the exact meaning and scope of this notion,
must raise further doubts as to the potentially norm-creating charac-
ter of the rule.” (Ibid, p. 42.)


“85. .. . It emerges from the history of the development of the legal
régime of the continental shelf, . . . that the essential reason why the
equidistance method is not to be regarded as a rule of law is that, if it
were to be compulsorily applied in all situations, this would not be
consonant with certain basic legal notions which, .. . have from the
beginning reflected the opinio juris in the matter of delimitation ;
those principles being that delimitation must be the object of agree-
ment between the States concerned, and that such agreement must be
arrived at in accordance with equitable principles.” (I.C.J. Reports
1969, p. 46.)

60. According to my understanding, the ostensible solution of suggest-
ing that, since there is no obligatory rule applicable in all cases, the
delimitation is to be effected by agreement, is no solution at all. As I have
pointed out above (para. 55) in my analysis of Article 6 of the Convention
on the Continental Shelf, the rule calling for delimitation by agreement
remains simply a rule concerning procedure and cannot constitute a prin-
ciple or rule of delimitation. Neither is there anything specific to delimi-
tation in the requirement to reach such agreement in accordance with
equitable principles, while the declaration that use of the equidistance
method must be denied the status of a rule of law on account of some a
priori incompatibility with this requirement is a dictum that could only be
justified if it had been proved that the line reflecting equitable principles
could not be, or could only by coincidence be, an equidistance line. Suffice
it to say that a rule may be a rule, even a paramount rule, and yet not have
to be “compulsorily applied in all situations”.

61. The Court in 1969 found that the equidistance principle could not
be a rule of law, yet it could not suggest any alternative. It stated :

“83. ... [A]s between States faced with an issue concerning the
lateral delimitation of adjacent continental shelves, there are still rules
and principles of law to be applied ; and in the present case it is not the
fact either that rules are lacking, or that the situation is one for the
unfettered appreciation of the Parties. Equally, it is not the case that if

It held in the operative paragraph of the Judgment that there was “no other
single method of delimitation, the use of which is in all circumstances
obligatory” (para. 101). In place of suggesting a method, it provided a
definition whereby the appurtenance of a given sea-bed area to a particular
State could be ascertained or recognized : the area in question had to be the
“natural prolongation” of that State’s land territory. Whatever method
could be devised for applying that definition might thus be an aid to
delimitation, but it could hardly be described as a method of delimitation.
