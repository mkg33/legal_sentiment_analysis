I regret to be unable to concur in the Judgment of the Court which
“finds that the Applicants cannot be considered to have established any
substantive right or legal interest appertaining to them in the subject-
matter of the present claims”. Nor am J able to agree with the reasons
upon which it is based. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Statute I propose
to state the grounds for my dissent.

The Court by its Judgment of 21 July 1962 rejected all the four ob-
jections and stated separate reasons for each rejection. With reference
to the third objection, the Court stated, inter alia:

“For the manifest scope and purport of the provisions of this
Article indicate that the Members of the League were understood
to have a legal right or interest in the observance by the Mandatory
of its obligations both toward the inhabitants of the Mandated
Territory, and toward the League of Nations and its Members.”
(I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 343.)

In its operative clause the Judgment states that “The Court, by eight
votes to seven, finds that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the
merits of the dispute”.


in the subject-matter of their claims. The Judgment finds that the
Applicants have no such right or interest in the performance provisions
of the Mandate for South West Africa. It seems to me that the main

But the mandates system, while it bears some resemblance to, and
was probably inspired by, the concept of guardianship or tutelle in
private law, the similarity is very limited. Unlike the municipal law
concept with its simple characteristics and limited scope, the mandates
system has a complex character all of its own, with a set of general
and particular obligations for the mandatory to observe or carry out,
and with a scheme of multiple control and supervision by the League
of Nations with its Council, Assembly, member States and the Permanent
Mandates Commission and with judicial protection in the last resort
by the Permanent Court. It is a novel international institution. Nothing
of the kind had existed before. It is sui generis.

At this juncture I think a few words about the historical background
of the creation of the mandates system will be useful to enable a full
understanding and appreciation of its nature, spirit and purport. As
we all know, it was President Wilson, author of the. Fourteen Points,
who first made the radical proposal in the Council of Ten of the Versailles
Peace Conference to renounce in fact the time-honoured -principle of
annexation by conquest and to set up in its stead a new international
mandates system to be operated by the League of Nations and based
upon the concept of a sacred trust entirely in the interest of the inhabi-
tants of the territories to be thus placed under mandate. He had at

each case by the Council”. Thus, for example, Article 6 of the Mandate
for South West Africa provides for the making of annual reports by
the Mandatory “to the satisfaction of the Council”, and Article 7 of the
same Mandate provides in the first paragraph that “the consent of the
Council of the League of Nations is required for any modification
of the terms of the present Mandate’ and in the second paragraph (the
adjudication clause) that—

“The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should arise
between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of
Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the
provisions of the Mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by
negotiation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the
League of Nations.”

That the above finding of the Applicants’ possession of a legal right
or interest in the performance of the Mandate for South West Africa is
correct is also borne out by the provision and language of Article 7 (2),
the text of which has already been cited earlier.

This right or interest is not, as affirmed in effect by the Judgment,
limited to the material or national interests of the individual League
Members as provided for in Article 5 of the Mandate for South West
Africa relating to freedom of missionaries “to enter into, travel and
reside in the territory for the purpose of prosecuting their calling”.
The broad, plain and comprehensive language of the provision implies
that the content and scope of the legal right or interest of the Members
of the League of Nations is co-extensive with the obligations of the
Mandatory under the Mandate; it is not restricted to the content of the
said Article 5.

Furthermore, the origin of the compromissory clause and the evolution
of its present form of wording as to its content is also significant and
throws light on the intention of its authors. As brought out in the separate
opinion of Judge Jessup appended to the 1962 Judgment, the compro-
missory clause was first proposed in the United States’ alternative draft
for ‘B’ mandates submitted to the Milner Commission. The representa-
tives of Great Britain and France “both said that they had no objection
to the principle of recourse to the international Court” but they objected
to the grant of a right to individuals to invoke the jurisdiction of the
Court for decision relating to infractions of the rights conferred on
them by certain provisions of the draft mandates. However, further
discussion resulted in the deletion of the references to the specific articles
concerning rights of individuals. All this related to the draft for ‘B’
mandates, which was, after revision, duly approved by the Commission.
Shortly afterwards, a draft was adopted to serve as a pattern for ‘C’
mandates with a paragraph concerning reference to the Court which
“was identical with the first paragraph of the United States’ draft”,
which had embodied the principle of recourse to the international
Court and to which the British and French representatives had said that
they had no objection. (See Judge Jessup’s separate opinion, I.C.J.



Reports 1962, p. 388.) The revision by the Council of the League of
Nations of the phrase “any dispute whatever between the members of
the League of Nations ...” into the phrase now found in Article 7,
namely “if any dispute whatever between the Mandatory and another
Member of the League of Nations” was explained by Viscount Ishii,
the Rapporteur, on the ground that the members of the League other
than the Mandatory “could not be forced against their will to submit
their difficulties to the Permanent Court”. This change was adopted
by the Council and the whole Mandate for South West Africa was
approved on 17 December 1920. It is thus seen that all those who had
anything to do with the original drafting or the final revision of the clause
took the implicit principle of judicial protection relating to the observance
of the mandate obligations by the respective mandatory Powers as a
matter of course and raised no objections whatever.

Judge Read, in his separate opinion appended to the same Advisory
Opinion of 1950, put the matter of the legal rights of the members of
the League even more strongly. He stated:

“As a result of the foregoing considerations, it is possible to
summarize the position, as regards the international status of
South-West Africa and the international obligations of the Union
arising therefrom, after the termination of the existence of the
League:

First: the Mandate survived, together with all of the essential

and substantive obligations of the Union.

Second: the legal rights and interests of the Members of the
League, in respect of the Mandate, survived with one important
exception—in the case of Members that did not become parties
to the Statute of this Court, their right to implead the Union
before the Permanent Court lapsed.” (Italics added.) (Zbid.,
p. 169.)

It is also to be noted that the resolution of the Assembly of the League
of Nations on mandates adopted on 18 April 1946 at its final session
before dissolution, corroborates the above finding. As it will be recalled,
the final paragraph of this resolution reads:

the very first obligation of the Mandatory is stated in the second para-
graph of Article 2 of the mandate agreement as follows:

“The Mandatory shall promote to the utmost the material and
moral well-being and the social progress of the inhabitants of the
territory subject to the present Mandate.”

Whatever power and authority the Mandatory possesses under the
Mandate are clearly not conferred to serve its own ends or to enure
to its own benefit or advantage, but solely for the purpose of enabling
it to fulfil its obligations. Any policy it adopts to administer the mandated
Territory is subject, among others, to this overriding obligation. Thus
the policy of apartheid or separate development (here I refer, not to
such policy as is in operation in South Africa, with which the Court is
not called upon to deal, but only to that which has been and is pursued
in South West Africa) should be examined in the light of this primary
obligation. The laws, regulations and measures of the Union (now
Republic) of South Africa are relevant to the instant cases only in so far
as they, by official proclamations, have been and are applied or made
applicable to the mandated Territory.



to the ownership of land in the so-called Police Zone, mining and the
mining industry, employment in the Railways and Harbours Adminis-
tration, vocational training and education.

Quite apart from considerations of an international norm or standard
of non-discrimination in general international law of today or in the
particular sphere of the trusteeship system of the United Nations, such
discrimination as practised by the Mandatory was consistently criticized
and deprecated even in the days of the Permanent Mandates Commission
of the League of Nations.

The ill effects and general detriment produced by the policy of apart-
heid or separate development upon the vast majority of the people
(452,254 non-Whites: 73,464 Whites) of the Territory are great and
far-reaching. They are neither marginal nor minimal, as has been claimed.
Nor are they justified by arguments based upon the principle of protection,
the principle of reciprocity, or the principle of compensation. It is a
self-evident truth that a whole consists of its parts and the parts make
up the whole. Any nation, community or society is made up of its indi-
vidual members. It can be a contented, progressive and developed
nation or community or society only when the mass of its individual
members enjoy well-being and achieve progress and advancement on
the basis of equality before the law. The individuals’ dissatisfaction and
detriment arising from their discriminatory treatment by law inevitably
produce adverse effects, however marginal, on the collectivity. In view
of the “sacred” mission to enable the peoples of the mandated territories
“to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of this modern
world” (Article 22 of the Covenant), and of the explicit obligations of
the Mandatory, stipulated in Article 2 of the Mandate for South West
Africa, to do its utmost to attain the objective of self-determination,
it is not unreasonable to expect that after 40 years of administration of
the Territory by the Mandatory, the people thereof would have attained
a substantial degree of political development. Yet it appears from the
record that with the possible exception of the Rehoboth Basters (11,257)
who have a semblance of limited local self-government in their district,
none of the non-White groups are granted any significant measure of
the franchise. Even the Ovambos (1960 census figures: 239,363), whose
group makes up more than 40 per cent. of the total population of the
Territory (526,004) do not enjoy any substantial measure of local self-
government. As the Odendaal Commission of Enquiry, a government-
appointed body, has reported (January 1964) in connection with its
recommendation to relax the control on the liquor traffic: “today they
have progressed so far on the road of development that the Commission
has recommended that they be granted an advanced form of self-govern-
ment; and, secondly, that if the Commission failed to comply with the
strong representation made by all groups, the latter would not only be
bitterly disappointed but would even be aggrieved.” (Odendaal Report,
p. 487.)



On the other hand the White group, since the enactment of the South
West Africa Constitution Act, 1925, has been exercising a right of self-
government through the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa
constituted by members they elect periodically. This legislative organ,
to which the non-White groups are not entitled to elect representatives,
is empowered to make laws for the Territory to cover all matters except
those reserved in the said Act, including Native Affairs, railways and
harbours, and certain other matters.

The record thus shows that the policy of apartheid or separate de-
velopment, as pursued in South West Africa, as far as the non-White
groups are concerned, has not been and is not compatible with the basic
principle of the “sacred trust of civilization’ or with the Respondent’s
obligation under Article 2 of the Mandate “to promote to the utmost
the material and moral well-being and the social progress of the in-
habitants of the territory subject to the present Mandate”.

The second cardinal principle of the mandates system is international
accountability for the performance of the sacred trust. It is broadly
sanctioned by paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of Article 22 of the Covenant and
more concretely by the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the mandate
agreement. By virtue of the said Article 6 requiring the Mandatory to
“make to the Council of the League of Nations an annual report to
the satisfaction of the Council” on its administration of the mandated
territory and similar provisions in the other Mandates, this body, by
its resolution of 31 January 1923, also adopted a set of rules calling
upon the Mandatories to transmit petitions from the inhabitants of
each mandated territory to the Permanent Mandates Commission. In
short, international accountability necessarily comprises the essential
obligations of submission to international supervision and control of
the mandatory’s administration of the mandated territory and acceptance
of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court in any dispute
between it and another Member of the League of Nations relating to
the interpretation or the application of the provisions of a given mandate.
