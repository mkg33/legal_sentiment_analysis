exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction  Venezuela’s objection on basis of Monetary Gold principle
is objection to exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction, and not objection to jurisdiction.

      Principle of res judicata  Force of res judicata attaches to a judgment on jurisdiction 
Operative part of a judgment possesses force of res judicata  Its meaning may be determined with
reference to the reasoning  Force of res judicata does not attach to matters not determined
expressly or by necessary implication  Judgment of 18 December 2020 on jurisdiction

whether United Kingdom is indispensable third party without the consent of which the Court may

       Allegation that legal interests of United Kingdom would be the very subject-matter of the
Court’s decision  Guyana, Venezuela and United Kingdom are parties to Geneva Agreement, on
which the Court’s jurisdiction is based  Legal implications of United Kingdom being a party to
Geneva Agreement  Interpretation of relevant provisions of Geneva Agreement necessary  The
Court to apply rules of interpretation in Articles 31 to 33 of Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties,

Agreement in consultation with British Guiana  Forthcoming independence of British Guiana
taken into account  Initial stage of process for settlement of dispute  Articles I and II of Geneva
Agreement providing for appointment of Mixed Commission by Venezuela and British Guiana  No
role for United Kingdom in initial stage  Venezuela and British Guiana having sole role in
settlement of dispute through Mixed Commission  Final stages of process for settlement of
dispute  Article IV of Geneva Agreement  No reference to United Kingdom  Guyana and
Venezuela bearing responsibility to choose means of peaceful settlement  Failing agreement,
matter to be referred to Secretary-General for choice of means of settlement  No role for
United Kingdom in process of settlement of dispute pursuant to Article IV.

      Dispute settlement scheme established by Articles II and IV of Geneva Agreement reflects a
common understanding of all parties that controversy would be settled by Guyana and Venezuela
without the United Kingdom’s involvement  Acceptance by United Kingdom of scheme 
United Kingdom aware of Venezuela’s allegations of its wrongdoing  Letter of 14 February 1962
from Venezuela’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations to the Secretary-General 
Statements of Venezuela and United Kingdom before Fourth Committee of General Assembly in
November 1962  Tripartite Examination in 1965 of documentary material relevant to validity of
1899 Award  United Kingdom aware of scope of dispute  Acceptance by United Kingdom not to
be involved in settlement of dispute between Guyana and Venezuela.

      Examination of subsequent practice of parties to Geneva Agreement  Venezuela’s exclusive
engagement with Guyana at Mixed Commission and in implementation of Article IV of Geneva
Agreement  Agreement of the parties that dispute could be settled without involvement of
United Kingdom.

      Acceptance by United Kingdom, by virtue of being a party to Geneva Agreement, that dispute
could be settled by one of the means set out in Article 33 of Charter of United Nations without its
involvement  Monetary Gold principle does not come into play  Possibility of future
pronouncement in Judgment on merits regarding certain conduct attributable to United Kingdom
would not preclude the Court from exercising its jurisdiction based on application of Geneva
Agreement.

      Venezuela’s preliminary objection is rejected.



       73. In light of the Court’s finding above that Venezuela’s preliminary objection is not an
objection to the Court’s jurisdiction, the time-limits that the Court set out in the Order of 19 June
2018 did not apply to pleadings with respect to such objection. Venezuela thus remained entitled to
raise that objection within the time-limit set out in Article 79bis, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court.


     74. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Venezuela’s preliminary objection is
admissible. The Court will now proceed to the examination of this preliminary objection.


                 III. EXAMINATION OF VENEZUELA’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

       75. In its preliminary objection, Venezuela submits that the United Kingdom is an
indispensable third party to the proceedings and that the Court cannot decide the question of the
validity of the 1899 Award in the United Kingdom’s absence. Venezuela argues that a judgment of
the Court on the merits in this case would necessarily involve, as a prerequisite, an evaluation of the
lawfulness of certain “fraudulent conduct” allegedly attributable to the United Kingdom in respect
of the 1899 Award. Venezuela explains that since the United Kingdom was a party to the Washington
Treaty and to the arbitration that resulted in the 1899 Award, and is a party to the Geneva Agreement,
an evaluation of the allegedly fraudulent conduct would involve an examination of the
United Kingdom’s “commitments and responsibilities”.


        76. Venezuela alleges that it had been coerced and deceived by the United Kingdom to enter
into the Washington Treaty. It also alleges that, during the arbitral proceedings, there were certain
improper communications between the legal counsel of the United Kingdom and the arbitrators that
it had appointed, and that the United Kingdom knowingly submitted “doctored” and “falsified” maps
to the arbitral tribunal, which rendered the 1899 Award “null and void”. According to Venezuela,
each of these acts, independently, operates to invalidate the 1899 Award and to engage the
international responsibility of the United Kingdom. Venezuela submits that the United Kingdom’s
participation is required in order for Venezuela’s rights to be “duly protected” in the proceedings,
and adds that it is not able to dispute the rights and obligations arising from the conduct of a State
that is absent from these proceedings and whose participation cannot be enjoined by this Court.


       77. Relying, inter alia, on the Court’s jurisprudence in the cases concerning Monetary Gold
Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, and United States of America), East Timor (Portugal v. Australia) and Certain Phosphate
Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Venezuela asserts that an application is inadmissible if the
legal interests of a third State would constitute the very subject-matter of the decision that is applied
for, and that State has not consented to adjudication by the Court. Venezuela submits that the
commitments and responsibilities of the United Kingdom would constitute “the very object” and the
“very essence” of the decision to be rendered in the present case because the invalidity of the
1899 Award arises from the allegedly fraudulent conduct of the United Kingdom in respect of the
arbitration which resulted in the Award. In this regard, Venezuela maintains that the United Kingdom
has not transferred its commitments and obligations in respect of the 1899 Award to Guyana.

       78. Venezuela adds that if the Court determines that the United Kingdom is responsible for
fraudulent conduct, the consequence would be not only that the 1899 Award would cease to have
