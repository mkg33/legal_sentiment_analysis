                                       I. Prolegomena: Initial Considerations

                       1. I have accompanied the majority of the International Court of Jus-
                    tice (ICJ), in voting in support of the adoption today, 14 July 2020, of its
                    present Judgments dismissing the appeals raised by the applicant States in
                    the present correlated cases of Appeal relating to the Jurisdiction of the
                    ICAO Council under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil
                    Aviation (Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates [UAE]
                    v. Qatar) [hereinafter “ICAOA case”], and of Appeal relating to the Juris‑
                    diction of the ICAO Council under Article II, Section 2, of the 1944 Inter‑
                    national Air Services Transit Agreement (Bahrain, Egypt and UAE v.
                    Qatar) [hereinafter “ICAOB case”].
                       2. I arrive likewise at the conclusions of the ICJ set forth in the disposi‑
                    tif of the two present Judgments (ICAOA Judgment, para. 126; and
                    ICAOB Judgment, para. 127), also for the dismissal of all appeals raised
                    by the applicant States. This does not mean that my own reasoning coin-
                    cides entirely with that of the ICJ in the handling of all successive points
                    in the two present cases in this respect. This being so, I feel obliged to
                    present my current separate opinion, in order to express my own position
                    in relation to one of the arguments raised by the appellant States, in the
                    two present cases, namely, the argument concerning so-­called “counter-
                    measures”.

                         3. May I initially recall, at this preliminary stage, that, in general
                     terms, the appellant States in both cases base their first ground of appeal,
                     as to the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the ICAO Council, on the argu-
                    ment that the airspace restrictions adopted by them were taken as lawful
                    “countermeasures” in response to Qatar’s alleged prior breaches of
                    ­obligations arising under customary international law, as well as of res­
                     olutions of the Security Council, and of the Riyadh Agreements 1.
                      The appellant States further claim that, in their view, “countermeasures”
                      constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under general
                     ­international law, having been, to them, specially recognized under the
                      Riyadh Agreements 2.

                    paras. 1.21, 1.25-1.27, 1.31-1.32, 2.9 and 2.53-2.55; Memorial (ICAOB), paras. 1.22, 1.26-
                    1.28, 1.32-1.33, 2.8 and 2.52‑2.54; Memorials, (ICAOA and ICAOB), paras. 3.22 (a), 7.3-7.4
                    and 7.8; Replies (ICAOA and ICAOB), paras. 2.1-2.4; Reply (ICAOA), paras. 2.35-2.47; and

                       8. The appellant States, as just seen, have decided to rely, inter alia, on
                    “countermeasures”, bringing to the fore an unfortunate initiative taken
                    by the UN International Law Commission in its prolonged discussions
                    on the matter in the 1990s and until 2001 (infra). This having been so, I
                    feel bound to begin my own considerations of “countermeasures” in
                    breach of the foundations of the law of nations, and of State responsibil-
                    ity, and to present, in sequence, the criticisms of “countermeasures” in
                    corresponding debates of the International Law Commission, as well as
                    of the VI Committee of the UN General Assembly.

                      9. In effect, the International Law Commission consumed many years
                    of its work on the elaboration and adoption of its Articles on State
                    Responsibility (2001), which disclosed also some resistance to certain

                       6 This case is dealt with in the Judgment concerning the Appeal relating to the Jurisdic‑

                    tion of the ICAO Council under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation,
                    which thus mainly concerns the Chicago Convention.
                       7 There is also a separate point of contention as to the grounds — or otherwise — of

                    the ICAO Council’s decisions.

                    innovations not in accordance with the foundations of the law of nations.
                    Such was the case — as I warned in my general course delivered at the
                    Hague Academy of International Law in 2005 — of the space occupied,
                    in the elaboration of those Articles,

                         “by so-­called ‘countermeasures’ (Articles 22 and 49-54), in compari-
                         son with the much more succinct space devoted to serious breaches
                         of obligations under peremptory norms of general international law
                         (Articles 40-41). Ubi societas, ibi jus. It should not pass unnoticed that
                         countermeasures (. . .) ha[ve] now been taken to the centre of the
                         domain of State responsibility without originally and intrinsically
                         belonging to it. Countermeasures are reminiscent of the old practice
                         of retaliation, and, — whether one wishes to admit it or not, — they
                         rely upon force rather than conscience. Recourse to them discloses
                         the insufficient degree of development of the treatment of State
                         responsibility.” 8

                       10. In this respect, there have been warnings as to resort to “counter-
                    measures”: as the international legal order is based upon justice rather
                    than force, it has been criticized that to confer a high standing to “coun-
                    termeasures” in the domain of State responsibility is “to elevate to a posi-
                    tion of high dignity one of [international] society’s least dignified and
                    least sociable aspects”, thus condemning that society “to be what it is” 9.
                    Other criticisms have emanated from lucid trends of international legal
                    doctrine.
                       11. It has been recalled, e.g. that resort to “countermeasures” in prac-

                    rather than principles, disclosing clear risks of retaliations 10, which are to
                    be avoided. Judicial control of “countermeasures” was contemplated by
                    International Law Commission’s Rapporteur Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, in
                    his seventh Report (of 1995), stressing the need of an institutionalized
                    reaction — within the ambit of the United Nations — of the “organized

                    international community” 11, — and the idea of a neutral control of

                       12. I have recalled such criticisms in my aforementioned general course
                    delivered at the Hague Academy of International Law (2005), and I have
                    further warned that
                         “[t]he much larger space occupied by ‘countermeasures’ than by other
                         truly fundamental aspects of State responsibility in the 2001 Interna-
                         tional Law Commission Articles on the subject discloses an apparent
                         lack of confidence in the role of law for attaining justice; the greater
                         emphasis is therein shifted to coercive means — envisaged as ‘legal’
                         ones — rather than on conscience and the prevalence of opinio juris
                         communis.

                            Yet, in a domain of international law endowed with a specificity of
                         its own, such as the international law of human rights, the overall
                         picture is rather different. This is a domain which has rendered pos-
                         sible a re-­encounter with the very foundations of the international
                         responsibility of States. Herein attention is correctly focused on law
                         rather than force, on conscience rather than ‘will’, to the greater effec-
                         tiveness of public international law itself 13.” 14

                    particular to the step backwards taken by the insertion of “counter­
                    measures” in the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (cf. infra). Such
                    insertion took place despite the successive and strong criticisms of
                    “­countermeasures” in the prolonged debates on the matter, of the Inter-
                    national Law Commission as well as of the VI Committee of the UN
                    General Assembly (infra). I much regret that “countermeasures” have
                    been raised by the appellant States in the present ICAOA and ICAOB
                    cases; all the mistakes of the past in the raising and stating of the point,
                    with all its legal consequences, should not be forgotten in the present, at
                    least by those of us who believe in international law and work for its
                    prevalence.

                            III. Criticisms of “Countermeasures” in Corresponding

                                                 Law Commission

                       14. Strong criticisms to “countermeasures” were formulated in succes-
                    sive debates of the International Law Commission itself, in the period of
                    1992-2001, centred on the issue. Thus, one of the International Law Com-
                    mission members, Mr. Jiuyong Shi (China), took a categorical position
                    against them, warning as to the “impropriety” of the concept of “counter-­
                    measures” under general international law; to him, States allegedly
                    “injured” which took “countermeasures” were “often themselves the
                    wrongdoing States” 15. Thus, for Mr. J. Shi, the application of reprisals or
                    countermeasures disclosed the outcome of the relationship between “pow-
                    erful” States and “weak and small” States which were unable to assert
                    their rights under international law.
                       15. For that reason, many small States regarded “the concept of repri-
                    sals or countermeasures as synonymous with aggression or intervention,
                    whether armed or unarmed” 16. “Countermeasures”, — he added, — were
                    “controversial” and should not be included in the law of State responsi-
                    bility, being “certainly” to “the advantage of the more powerful States” 17.

                    cluded, — “countermeasures” remained “controversial”, reflecting “sim-
                    ply power relationships”, and should then “be excluded from the topic of
                    State responsibility” 18.

                       16. Another International Law Commission member who took like-
                    wise a categorical position against “counter‑measures” was Mr. Carlos
                    Calero Rodrigues (Brazil), who strongly criticized them; he warned that,
                    if the International Law Commission “was to be faithful to its duty of
                    contributing to the progressive development of international law, it must
                    try to establish limits to countermeasures in order to correct some of the
                    more glaring injustices to which their broad application might give rise” 19.
                    He advocated the “clear and unrestricted” prohibition of “countermea-
                    sures”, which “should not be considered legitimate” in threatening the
                    territorial integrity or independence of the State against which they were
                    applied; such “extreme coercion”, — he added, — “should not be
                    allowed” 20.
                       17. Carlos Calero Rodrigues stressed his own “faithfulness to the tra-
                    ditional Latin American position on that matter”, and reasserted his own
                    “endorsement of a strict prohibition of countermeasures which endan-

                    gered the territorial integrity or political independence of a State” 21. He
                    was firm in further warning that “countermeasures should not infringe on
                    fundamental human rights, diplomatic relations, the rules of jus cogens or
                    the rights or third States” 22.
                      18. Within the International Law Commission, as it can be seen, there
                    were those aforementioned members who remained strongly opposed to
                    the initiative of inserting into the Draft Articles a reference to so‑called
                    “countermeasures” all the time (supra). In addition, there were those
                    members who were critical of them from the start, though ending up not

                    these latter, one International Law Commission member, Mr. Awn Al-­
                    Khasawneh (Jordan), warned that States resorting to “countermeasures”
                    “took the law into their own hands”, forgetful of the rule of law at inter-
                    national legal level. To him, “countermeasures” raised the “likelihood of
                    abuse, largely because of power disparities among States”; furthermore,
                    there is the “punitive” function and intent of “countermeasures” 23.
                      19. Another International Law Commission member, Mr. Pemmaraju
                    Sreenivasa Rao (India), also warned that “countermeasures” reflected the
                    position of the “stronger party”, and one should have care not to trans-

                    prohibited 24. This point, originally made by him in 1992, was subsequently
                    taken again by him at the International Law Commission, in 1996, when
                    he expressly stated his “complete disagreement” with Chapter III of the
                    draft Articles on the controversial “countermeasures” 25. The International
                    Law Commission ended up with “an unsupportable, contradictory and
                    unjustified regime for countermeasures”; after all, he added, “[n]o State
                    should be encouraged to decide unilaterally to take the law into its own
                    hands, no matter how real the provocation to which it reacted” 26.
                      20. It seemed “advisable” to Mr. P. Sreenivasa Rao “to refer expressly
                    to the provisions of the [UN] Charter which dealt with the non-use of

                    namely:
                              “if the State accused of the internationally wrongful act defaulted, the
                              injured State would be free to act as it saw fit, and that was tanta-

                         continued to apply” 28.
                       21. In the International Law Commission’s debates of two years ear-
                    lier, Mr. John de Saram (Sri Lanka) pointed out that even when consider-
                    ing “countermeasures”, attention should be turned to multilateral (or
                    even bilateral) treaties, as from the UN Charter, in the light of their pro-

                    not achieved, — he added, — endeavours should be undertaken to avoid
                    “chaos” resulting from “the taking by individuals States of counter­
                    measures in an uncoordinated manner” 30.
                       22. Shortly afterwards at the International Law Commission,
                    Mr. Václav Mikulka (Czech Republic) pondered, as to the “consequences
                    of State crimes”, that “priority should be given to the collective response
                    of the international community”, so as to avoid “countermeasures”; in his
                    view, it would here be desirable for the International Law Commission “to
                    establish the regime of responsibility for State crimes” 31. The International
                    Law Commission members also counted, in mid-1994, on the intervention

                    Asian-­African Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC), who acknowl-
                    edged the concern expressed at the International Law Commission as to
                    the formulation of a “regime of unilateral countermeasures” with its
                    “inherent danger of abuse”, as to the “recourse to reprisals”, as well as to
                    a “resort to unlawful or disproportionate countermeasures” 32.
                       23. Subsequently, in the International Law Commission’s debates,
                    Mr. Peter Kabatsi (Uganda) made clear that he was “totally opposed to
                    legalizing unilateral self-help at the international level by one State against
                    another, as that would only serve the interests of the strong against the
                    weak and the rich against the poor” 33. He added that Chapter III of the

                    vate the situation of the State against which the countermeasures were
                    directed” 34. Likewise, there were those International Law Commission
                    members who criticized strongly “countermeasures”, though not oppos-
                    ing them until the end, despite the negative effects of resort to them.
                       24. One of those International Law Commission members (Mr. Julio
                    Barboza) wrote thoughtfully later (in 2003) that “countermeasures”
                    amounting to reprisals faced the prohibition found in General Assembly

                    resolution 2625 (XXX) 35. Prevalence was acknowledged to the obliga-
                    tions of protection of the human person, in the international law of

                    at all, — he added, — in “countermeasures”, in cases lodged with an
                    international tribunal, which can anyway order provisional measures of
                    protection before delivering its decision on the merits; to resort to “coun-
                    termeasures” without a test of their legality is a “step backwards” 37.


                       25. This critical point was in effect made also in the remaining debates
                    (in 2000-2001) of International Law Commission members on the matter.
                    Thus, in 2000, Mr. Maurice Kamto (Cameroon) pointed out that he had
                    kept his reservations to “countermeasures”, for being “a step backwards

                    lation of international relations through dispute settlement machinery,
                    including judicial machinery”; this was, in his view, a wrong step taken by
                    the International Law Commission, as there was no basis in general cus-
                    tomary law for “countermeasures”, being a wrongful resort to sanc-
                    tions 38. To him, it should be kept in mind that countermeasures were
                    unduly devised in the late 1970s and early 1980s, considerably weakening
                    the Security Council’s authority and expanding “private justice” 39.

                    mission, Mr. Christopher John Robert Dugard (South Africa) pondered
                    that international lawyers disliked “countermeasures” and reprisals as
                    they were “primitive and lacked the means for law enforcement”; so-­
                    called “reciprocal countermeasures” were thus to be rejected 40. He fur-
                    ther warned that “[m]ost countermeasures inevitably had some adverse
                    impact on some human rights, particularly in the social and economic
                    field” 41. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt) also criticized
                    countermeasures for being “highly controversial”, and for underlining the
                    “imbalance” and widening “the gap between rich and powerful States and
                    the rest”, having thus been “used and abused” in the contemporary

                    likewise declared that he “remained opposed” to countermeasures, as

                    “they continued to be a threat to small and weak States and gave the
                    more powerful States another weapon” 43.

                       27. At the final stage of consideration of the Draft Articles on State
                    Responsibility, the International Law Commission counted on relevant
                    comments received from States (at the original request from the UN Gen-
                    eral Assembly), reproduced in its Yearbook (1998 and 2001). In 1998,
                    Mexico and Argentina presented their criticisms of the inclusion of

                    tries, stated that “there is no room for countermeasures where a manda-
                    tory system of dispute settlement exists as between the conflicting
                    parties” 45. And the Czech Republic held that “countermeasures are not
                    considered to constitute a ‘right’ per se of an injured State” 46.


                       28. Later on, in 2001, China criticized the reference to “counter­
                    measures”, and called for “appropriate restrictions on their use” 47. Japan,
                    for its part, likewise warned as to the risk of abuse of “countermeasures”,
                    and fully shared “the concern expressed by quite a few States in the

                    “substantial and procedural restrictions” 48. Mexico, for its part, much
                    regretted the decision of inclusion of “countermeasures” into the Draft
                    under consideration, which “would open the way to abuse” which “could
                    aggravate an existing conflict”; the result could be “extremely risky, espe-
                    cially for the weakest States”, and such risks should be minimized, avoid-
                    ing their use “for punitive purposes” 49.


                       29. Argentina was likewise critical, warning against “the exceptional
                    nature of countermeasures”, and the need “to minimize the possibility of

                    sion’s Articles on State Responsibility (2001), the Rapporteur, Mr. James
                    Crawford, in the commentaries he published, observed critically that the
                    chapter containing countermeasures “was the most controversial aspect
                    of the provisional text adopted in 2000. Concerns were expressed at vari-
                    ous levels” (e.g. in relation to implementation of State responsibility; in
                    respect of obligations not subject to countermeasures; and by reference to
                    the so-­called “collective” countermeasures). After recalling that at least
                    one State (Greece) argued that “countermeasures should be prohibited

                          of the VI Committee of the United Nations General Assembly

                      30. Criticisms of countermeasures were, furthermore, firmly expressed
                    in the parallel and corresponding debates of successive sessions (1992-
                    2000) of the VI Committee of the UN General Assembly. Thus, e.g. in the
                    debates of 4 November 1992 of the VI Committee, the delegate of Indo-
                    nesia (Mr. Abdul Nasier) warned that “countermeasures generally tended
                    to be punitive”; in particular, “armed countermeasures were contrary” to
                    Article 2 (3) and (4) of the UN Charter, and, “[a]ccordingly, countermea-


                       31. Other criticisms along the years of debates on the matter in the
                    VI Committee were firmly formulated and sustained by the Cuban dele-
                    gation. Thus, in the debates of 5 November 1992, the delegate of Cuba
                    (Ms Olga Valdés) warned that, in resorting to “reprisals or countermea-
                    sures”, powerful or rich countries “easily enjoy an advantage over weak
                    or poor countries” 53. She added that they contain “the seeds of aggres-
                    sion”, being moreover surrounded by uncertainty 54; accordingly, they are
                    not desirable in international law 55.

                    sures”. Thus, subsequently, in the debates of the VI Committee of
                    4 December 2000, the delegate of Cuba (Ms Soraya Alvarez Núñez)
                    opposed “countermeasures” are being “most controversial”, and as
                    amounting to “armed reprisals”, involving “collective sanctions or collec-
                    tive interventions” 56. She added that such reprisals “tended to aggravate
                    disputes between States” by resorting to “the wrongful use of force” 57.
                    Such politically motivated tactic was “in violation of the principles of the
                    Charter of the United Nations and [of] international law” 58.

                      33. There were other strong criticisms by States’ representatives of
                    “countermeasures” in the work of the VI Committee of the General
                    Assembly. Thus, e.g. in its debates of 4 November 1993 on the matter, the
                    delegate of Mexico (Mr. Juan Manuel Gómez Robledo) warned that “the
                    imposition of unilateral sanctions by one or more States” in reaction to
                    the conduct of another State was a breach of international law, that
                    “might exacerbate international conflicts”, and thus all provisions or ref-
                    erences to “countermeasures should be deleted” 59.

                    “countermeasures”, in the prolonged debates of the VI Committee of the
                    General Assembly on the matter. For example, in the debates of
                    13 November 2000, the delegate of India (Mr. Prem Gupta) strongly crit-
                    icized that resort of “States to take countermeasures was open to serious
                    abuse”, and thus the point should be excluded “altogether from the scope
                    of State responsibility, leaving issues concerning such measures to be
                    dealt with under general international law, especially under the Charter
                    of the United Nations” 60.
                       35. He added that “countermeasures” were “merely sanctions under
                    another name”, which “should not be used to punish a State”. The dele-

                    itarian consequences and the need to protect civilian populations from
                    their adverse effects”; in his understanding, “countermeasures could not
                    be taken and, if taken, must be immediately suspended, if an internation-
                    ally wrongful act had ceased or if the dispute had been submitted to a
                    court or tribunal with authority to hand down binding decisions” 61.

                       36. On his part, the delegate of Pakistan (Mr. Akhtar Ali Kazi) was
                    likewise critical: in the debates of the VI Committee of 5 November 1992,
                    for example, he warned that opinions within the International Law Com-
                    mission were “divided as to whether provisions on countermeasures

                    deriving from the “the disparities in the size, power and level of develop-
                    ment of States” 62. “Countermeasures”, —he continued, —gave advan-
                    tage to “powerful or rich” States over “weak or poor” States; these latter
                    required “particular attention” in the context of “countermeasures”, “in
                    order to prevent the regime from becoming a tool of power politics” 63.

                       37. In the same debates of the VI Committee of 5 November 1992,
                    strong criticisms were also proffered by the delegate of Algeria (Mr. Sidi
                    Abed), who began by warning that so-­called “countermeasures” origi-

                    nated from the practice of “the most powerful” States 64. “Countermea-
                    sures” thus required, — he added, — “the most careful safeguards”,
                    taking into account the “de facto inequalities between States” so as to
                    avoid a “questionable” practice leading to “abuses”, and to remedy a
                    “situation when the rules of international law were violated” 65.

                    criticized throughout the whole preparatory work of the corresponding
                    provisions of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State
                    Responsibility. It is somehow surprising and regrettable that, despite all
                    the firm criticisms against them, they counted on supporters for their
                    inclusion in those Draft Articles, without any juridical grounds; it is like-
                    wise surprising and regrettable that the ICJ itself referred to “counter-
                    measures” in its Judgment of 25 September 1997 in the case of
                    Gabčíkovo-­ Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment, I.C.J.
                    Reports 1997, pp. 55‑56, paras. 82-85), and again referred to it in the pres-
                    ent Judgments of the ICJ of today in the two cases of ICAOA and ICAOB




                              V. The Prevalence of the Imperative of Judicial Settlement
                                              over the State’s “Will”

                         39. There were further criticisms to the initiative of consideration of
                      so-­called “countermeasures” (cf. infra). There are other points to take
                      here into account, e.g. there were, on the other hand, those who, in super-
                      ficially favouring “countermeasures”, appeared clearly oblivious of the

                    ­justice. Once again, in the present case, the ICJ reiterates its view that
                      jurisdiction is based on State consent, which I have always opposed
                      within the Court: in my perception, human conscience stands above
                     ­voluntas.

                                   1. Further Criticisms of So-­Called “Countermeasures”
                      40. Further criticisms of the controversial initiative of considering
                    “countermeasures” were promptly raised from distinct sources. In the
                    mid-1990s (in 1994), e.g. it was timely warned that “[u]nilateral counter-
                    measures” were, “without doubt, extremely difficult and perhaps even

                    the strong against the weak” 66. Even a narrative study (of 2000) of the

                    International Law Commission draft, shortly before its adoption, did not
                    prescind from acknowledging “the controversial issue of countermea-
                    sures”, and the fact that “several members” of the International Law
                    Commission “continued to voice concern that smaller States may suffer
                    the abuse of countermeasures by powerful States” 67.

                    that “many [International Law Commission] members shared the concern
                    expressed forcefully by the Special Rapporteur that the unilateral charac-
                    ter of countermeasures opens up the possibility of their abuse, especially
                    (but not only) by powerful States” 68. It was then recalled that the Inter-
                    national Law Commission, in its Report of 1993, criticized that unilateral
                    “countermeasures” were to “the detriment of the principles of equality
                    and justice”; furthermore, they let the deciding State to exercise coercion,
                    to which those in favour of “compulsory dispute settlement” were clearly
                    opposed, focusing on the “common interest” of preventing “their illicit
                    and arbitrary use” 69.

                                2. Earlier Lessons on the Importance of the Realization
                                                       of Justice
                        42. Moreover, may I here add that it is to keep in mind likewise some
                    lessons from a more distant past, identified by learned international
                    jurists, in a distinct and wider horizon. Thus, to recall one early example,
                    in his thoughtful book La justice internationale, published in 1924,
                    four years after the adoption of the Statute of the old Permanent Court
                    of International Justice (PCIJ), Nicolas Politis, in recalling the historical
                    development from private justice to public justice, advocated for the
                    ­evolution, at international level, from optional to compulsory jurisdic-

                        43. Subsequently, in the earlier years of the new era of the ICJ, in
                     1952, Antonio Truyol y Serra firmly criticized legal positivism, and
                    stressed the importance of general principles of international law,
                    based upon natural law, for the interpretation and application of the
                    norms of the international legal order, thus assuring the realization of

                    and 249-250. Four decades later, Clarence Wilfred Jenks pondered that the foundation of
                    compulsory jurisdiction lies, ultimately, in the confidence in the rule of law at international
                    level; C. W. Jenks, The Prospects of International Adjudication, London: Stevens, 1964,
                    pp. 101, 117, 757, 762 and 770.

                    justice 71. He invoked earlier writings, e.g. of Alfred Verdross, and stressed
                    the relevance of recta ratio, for securing what he identified as the
                    ­universality of the new international law 72.

                       44. Still in the evolving years of the era of the ICJ, Maurice Bourquin
                    pondered, in 1960, that an international dispute may be lodged with an
                    international tribunal once it comes into existence, irrespectively of any
                    insistence on further exhaustion of diplomatic means or initiatives 73.
                    Recourse to judicial settlement is attentive to the existence of a disagree-
                    ment between the parties as to points of law or fact 74. The existence of the
                    dispute is already established in being submitted to the international tri-
                    bunal, to l’empire du droit, even if its object is not necessarily set up in “a
                    clear and definitive manner” 75.

                                          3. Human Conscience above Voluntas
                       45. The Judgment of the ICJ in the present case contains several cross-­
                    references (in paragraphs 67, 88, 90 and 93) to its own decisions (Order of
                    15 October 2008, and Judgment on preliminary objections of 1 April
                    2011) in the case of Application of the International Convention on the
                    Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian
                    Federation). The ICJ reiterates, in the present Judgment, its understand-
                    ing that “jurisdiction is based on consent” (para. 55). Within the ICJ, I
                    have always expressed my strong criticism of this misunderstanding.
                       46. May I here recall that, in my dissenting opinion in the case of

                    of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation) (Judgment of
                    1 April 2011), I firmly criticized the ICJ’s majority for reaching, as one of
                    its conclusions, the view that Article 22 of the CERD Convention
                    “imposes preconditions” to be complied with (Preliminary Objections,
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 128, para. 142, and p. 130,
                    para. 148), before a State could refer a dispute to the ICJ thereunder. In
                    my dissenting opinion, I then pondered:
                            “The fact is that there is no conclusive indication to that effect in
                         the travaux préparatoires of the CERD Convention, nor is there any
                         statement as to the existence of a resolutory obligation incumbent

                         ously by negotiation, before they can seize the ICJ. Resort to negoti-
                         ation was generally referred to as a factual effort or attempt only,
                         rather than as a resolutory obligation.” (I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I),
                         p. 286, para. 101.)

                       47. I then added that the position of the ICJ’s majority in the cas
                    d’espèce, as to Article 22 of the CERD Convention, in my perception,
                    “does not stand”; in this connection, I recalled that, in the travaux
                    préparatoires of the CERD Convention, there were clearly those “who
                    were sensitive to the regulation of social relations under the CERD Con-

                    ditions’” (ibid., pp. 287‑288, para. 107).
                       48. I next recalled that, at an earlier stage of proceedings in the case of
                    the Application of the CERD Convention (Georgia v. Russian Federation)
                    (Provisional Measures, Order of 15 October 2008, I.C.J. Reports 2008,
                    p. 353), the ICJ held that Article 22 of that Convention does not suggest
                    that formal negotiations thereunder would constitute “preconditions” to
                    be fulfilled before the seising of the ICJ; despite this timely clarification
                    made by the ICJ itself in its Order of 15 October 2008, in its subsequent
                    Judgment (Preliminary Objections, of 1 April 2011) in the same case, — I
                    warned in my dissenting opinion, — it “was incomprehensibly made dead

                    and deconstructed its own res interpretata” (I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I),
                    pp. 289‑290, paras. 112 and 114).


                       49. I expressed regret as to the outcome of the ICJ’s decision in the
                    case of the Application of the CERD Convention (1 April 2011), with “the
                    ineluctable consequence of inaptly and wrongfully giving pride of place to
                    State consent, even above the fundamental values at stake, underlying the
                    CERD Convention, which call for the realization of justice” (ibid., p. 318,
                    para. 202). I then again warned that the ICJ “cannot keep on privileging

                    sent has already been given by States at the time of ratification” of human
                    rights conventions (ibid., p. 320, para. 205).

                      50. It is further to be kept in mind, — I proceeded, — the “humanist
                    optics” whereby “the justiciables are, ultimately, the human beings con-
                    cerned” (well in keeping with the creation itself of the PCIJ and the ICJ);
                    thus, “to erect a mandatory ‘precondition’ of prior negotiations for the
                    exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction amounts to erecting, in my view, a
                    groundless and most regrettable obstacle to justice” (ibid., p. 321,
                    para. 208). And I then at last pondered, on this particular issue, that

                           “The Court cannot remain hostage of State consent. It cannot keep
                         displaying an instinctive and continuing search for State consent,

                         justice. The moment State consent is manifested is when the State
                         concerned decides to become a party to a treaty, — such as the human
                         rights treaty in the present case, the CERD Convention. The herme-
                         neutics and proper application of that treaty cannot be continuously
                         subjected to a recurring search for State consent. This would unduly
                         render the letter of the treaty dead, and human rights treaties are
                         meant to be living instruments, let alone their spirit.

                         condition, the need also persists to alleviate human suffering, by
                         means of the realization of justice. This latter is an imperative which
                         the World Court is to keep in mind. This goal — the realization of
                         justice — can hardly be attained from a strict State-­centred volunta-
                         rist perspective, and a recurring search for State consent. This Court
                         cannot, in my view, keep on paying lip service to what it assumes as
                         representing the State’s ‘intentions’ or ‘will’.

                             In the present Judgment, the Court entirely missed this point: it

                         paragraph 110, as ‘the fundamental principle of consent’. I do not at
                         all subscribe to its view, as, in my understanding, consent is not ‘fun-
                         damental’, it is not even a ‘principle’. What is ‘fundamental’, i.e., what
                         lays in the foundations of this Court, since its creation, is the impera-
                         tive of the realization of justice, by means of compulsory jurisdiction.
                         State consent is but a rule to be observed in the exercise of compulsory
                         jurisdiction for the realization of justice. It is a means, not an end, it
                         is a procedural requirement, not an element of treaty interpretation;
                         it surely does not belong to the domain of the prima principia. This is
                         what I have been endeavouring to demonstrate in the present dissent-

                       51. The awareness of the importance of the imperative of judicial set-
                    tlement of international disputes for the realization of justice and its prev-
                    alence over the State’s “will”, found support in international legal
                    thinking as from the beginning of the era of international tribunals
                    (cf. supra). Furthermore, international law, since its historical origins, has
                    been a law of nations, a droit des gens, and not a strictly inter-State law;
                    the human person was considered from the start as a subject of law 76. In
                    effect, the historical process of the humanization of the law of nations has

                       52. The fidelity to the original lessons and legacy of the “founding
                    fathers” of the law of nations (Part VI, infra) accounts for the reconstruc-
                    tion and evolution of the jus gentium in our times, in conformity with the
                    recta ratio, as a new and truly universal law of humankind. It is thus more
                    sensitive to the identification and realization of superior common values
                    and goals, concerning humankind as a whole. The historical trajectory of

                    development of the new jus gentium, may I here recall that in the present
                    ICAOA and ICAOB cases, the appellant States have asserted (in their
                    second ground of appeal) that the ICAO Council “erred in fact and in

                    tence of the ICAO Council” 78. The appellant States have thus requested

                          VI. International Legal Thinking and the Prevalence of


                        54. Keeping all this in mind, may I now recall here that the identifica-
                     tion of recta ratio flourished in this historical humanization of the law of
                    nations as from the writings of its “founding fathers” in the sixteenth and
                    seventeenth centuries, focusing the emerging new jus gentium in the realm
                    of natural law. This evolution found inspiration in the much earlier
                    ­scholastic philosophy of this outlook, in particular in the Aristotelian-
                           Thomist conception of recta ratio and justice, which conceived
                     Stoic-­
                     human beings as endowed with intrinsic dignity. The recta ratio came to

                     It was Cicero who effectively formulated the best-known characterization
                     of recta ratio, even if its roots go back to the thinking of ancient Greeks
                    (Plato and Aristotle), corresponding to its orthos logos 80.


                       55. In conformity with the principles of recta ratio, each subject of law
                    is to behave with justice, as such principles emanate from human con-
                    science, asserting the ineluctable relationship between law and ethics.
                    Natural law reflects the dictates of recta ratio, where justice has its foun-
                    dations. In his ancient time, Marcus Tullius Cicero attributed (in

                    validity, extending to all nations in all epochs. In his well-known De Leg‑
                    ibus (On the Laws, Book II, circa 51-43 bc), he pondered that nothing was
                    “more destructive” than “the use of violence in public affairs” 81. Cicero
                    left a relevant legacy to the “founding fathers” of the law of nations, in
                    situating the recta ratio in the foundations of the jus gentium itself.

                      56. The classical jus gentium of Roman law 82, in transcending with the
                    passing of time its origins of private law, was wholly transformed, in

                       80 Cf. D. P. Dryer, “Aristotle’s Conception of Orthos Logos”, 66 The Monist (1983),

                    pp. 106‑119; according to this latter, the recta ratio turns to what is good. The Stoics
                    pursued further the path of ethical virtue, whereby all that is correct is determined, in
                    many aspects, by orthos logos; cf. J. M. Rist, “An Early Dispute about Right Reason”, 66
                    The Monist (1983), pp. 39‑48.

                    University Press, 2003 [reed.], Book III, ibid., p. 172. And again in his De Republica (circa
                    end of the years 50 and 46 bc), Cicero opposed the destructive use of force ignoring law

                    (Book III, para. 42).

                    associating itself with the emerging law of nations 83, — to what decisively
                    contributed the writings of the “founding fathers” of this latter, particu-
                    larly those of Francisco de Vitoria, Francisco Suárez, Alberico Gentili,
                    Hugo Grotius, Cornelius van Bynkershoek, Samuel Pufendorf and Chris-
                    tian Wolff, among others. The new jus gentium, as from the sixteenth and

                    engaged in securing its unity and in attending its needs and aspirations 84,
                    in conformity with an essentially universalist conception 85.
                       57. The jus communicationis of Francisco de Vitoria, for example, was
                    conceived as a law for all human beings. Thus, already in the sixteenth
                    and seventeenth centuries, to de Vitoria and Suárez the emerging State
                    was not an exclusive subject of the law of nations, which comprised more-
                    over peoples and individuals; humankind was taken into account even
                    before the emerging States 86. The international legal order was necessary
                    rather than “voluntary”, with recta ratio in its foundations 87.
                       58. It may here be recalled that, in the sixteenth century, in his well-­

                    the legal order, that the international community (totus orbis) has pri-
                    macy over the “will” of each individual State 88; furthermore, it is coexten-
                    sive with humankind itself. The new jus gentium secured the unity of

                        87 Even before the “founding fathers” of the law of nations, already in the thir-

                    teenth century Thomas Aquinas (1225‑1274), in his Summa Theologiae, expressed the

                    apprehended by natural reason itself (being thus more perfect than positive law), revealing
                    a conscience of the temporal dimension and being endowed with a universal validity;

                    to the realization of the common good, and thus to the realization of justice, in pursuance
                    of recta ratio; T. Aquinas, Treatise on Law, Washington, DC: Gateway Ed., 2001 [reprint],

                    and 46. The jus gentium sought to regulate human relations on an ethical basis, in search of
                    the realization of the common good.

                        89 F. de Vitoria defined this new jus gentium as quod naturalis ratio inter omnes gentes

                    constituit, vocatur jus gentium. This latter could not derive from the “will” of its subjects
                    of law (including the emerging national States), but was based rather on a lex praeceptiva,

                    lex praeceptiva of natural law — for the totus orbis, susceptible of being
                    found by the recta ratio inherent to humankind 90. The way was thus
                    paved for a universal jus gentium, for the apprehension by reason of jus
                    gentium as a true jus necessarium, transcending the limitations of the jus

                       59. From the whole work of Francisco de Vitoria, and in particular
                    from his Relectio De Indis Prior, the conception emerged of a jus gentium
                    entirely emancipated from its origin of private law — in Roman law —
                    endowed with a humanist vision, at universal level 92. Furthermore, repa-
                    ration for violations of human rights came to reflect an international need
                    assisted by the law of nations, in conformity with the recta ratio, with the
                    same principles of justice applying to emerging States as well as to indi-
                    viduals or peoples forming them 93. In echoing likewise the universalist
                    vision of the law of nations, Alberico Gentili (author of De Jure Belli,
                    1598), sustained, at the end of the sixteenth century, that it is the law

                       60. In the seventeenth century, in the vision of Francisco Suárez
                    (author of Tractatus De Legibus ac Deo Legislatore, 1612), the subjects of
                    law (emerging States and others) needed a universal legal system to regu-
                    late their relations as members of the universal community 95. The new jus
                    gentium is formed by the uses and customs common to humankind, being
                    conformed by natural reason for the humankind as a whole as an univer-


                    apprehended by human reason. Cf. A. A. Cançado Trindade, A Recta Ratio nos Funda‑

                    of the common good, added that natural law is found in recta ratio, not in the “will”;

                    sal law 96. F. Suárez also drew attention to the precepts of jus gentium
                    encompassing equity and justice, in whole harmony with natural law,
                    wherefrom its norms emanate disclosing its truly universal character 97.

                       61. The contribution of Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Suárez,
                    from the Spanish theological school, to the consolidation of the new jus

                    thinking to the historical reality of the sixteenth century, while Suárez
                    presented a formulation of the matter which paved the way for the work
                    of Hugo Grotius. Together, de Vitoria and Suárez set up the bases of a
                    law of universal application (commune omnibus gentibus), of a law for
                    humankind as a whole.
                       62. In the conception of jus gentium of Hugo Grotius (De Jure Belli ac
                    Pacis, 1625), it is made clear that the State is not an end in itself, but a
                    means to secure the social order, and to perfect civil society which “com-
                    prises the whole of humankind” 98. The State is to pursue the common
                    good, respectful of the rights of human beings; in his view, the raison

                    their own State 99. The writings of H. Grotius make it clear that one can-
                    not pretend to base the international community itself on the voluntas of
                    each State individually.

                       63. Grotius sustained that international relations were subject to the
                    legal norms, and not to the raison d’Etat, which is incompatible with
                    the existence itself of the international community: this latter cannot
                    ­prescind from law 100. In this line of thinking, Samuel Pufendorf (author
                     of De Jure Naturae et Gentium Libri Octo, 1672) likewise identified
                     natural law itself with recta ratio 101. On his turn, Christian Wolff

                     (author of Jus Gentium Methodo Scientifica Pertractatum, 1749),
                     pondered that, as individuals have to promote the common good,

                    fection 102.
                       64. Following that, the personification of the powerful State, inspired
                    in the legal philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, had unfortu-
                    nately a most regrettable influence upon international law by the end of
                    the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth century.

                    fathers” of international law (supra) 103 were discarded by the emergence
                    of legal positivism, endowing States with a “will” of their own and reduc-
                    ing the rights of human beings to those “granted” by States.
                       65. Voluntarist positivism, grounded on the consent or “will” of States,
                    became the predominant criterion, denying jus standi to human beings,
                    and envisaging a strictly inter-State law, no longer above but between sov-
                    ereign States 104. It resisted to the ideal of emancipation of human beings
                    and their recognition as subjects of international law, keeping them under
                    the absolute control of the State. Yet, the idea of the absolute State sov-
                    ereignty (with which legal positivism aligned itself, ineluctably subservient

                    of the State, not impeding the successive atrocities committed by it against
                    human beings, with the passing of time became entirely groundless, as the
                    disastrous consequences of such distortion had become widely known.

                       66. The truth is that, from the “founding fathers” of the law of nations
                    grounded on the recta ratio until our times, the jusnaturalist thinking in
                    international law has never faded away 105; it overcame all crises, in its
                    perennial reaction of human conscience against successive atrocities com-
                    mitted against human beings, which regrettably counted on the subservi-
                    ence and cowardice of legal positivism. It could be argued that the

                    “founding fathers” of the law of nations, who supported a civitas maxima
                    ruled by the droit des gens.


                       102 For references to recta ratio and to conscience in the doctrine of mid-­

                    nineteenth century, cf., e.g. J. J. Burlamaqui, The Principles of Natural and Politic Law
                    (reprint of 7th ed.), Columbus: J. H. Riley, 1859, pp. 136, 138-139 and 156‑163.

                    himself to resort to force, Emmanuel Kant eloquently warned, at the end of the eigh-
                    teenth century, in his well-known essay on the Perpetual Peace (1795), that human beings
                    cannot be utilized by States for killing, which would not be in accordance with “the law

                    it), there is no way to deny that the human aspiration remains the same,
                    namely, that of the construction of an international legal order applicable
                    both to States (and international organizations) as well as to individuals,
                    pursuant to certain universal standards of justice 106, and concerning
                    humankind as a whole. As from the initial influence of the thinking of
                    Francisco de Vitoria (supra), a “continuing revival” of natural law 107,
                    which has never faded away, has been constantly identified. Rather than
                    being a return to classical natural law, it is a reassertion or restoration of
                    a standard of justice, whereby positive law is reconsidered 108, — bearing
                    in mind the conservationist view and the degeneration of legal positivism


                       68. The “continuing revival” of natural law strengthens the safeguard
                    of the universality of the rights inherent to all human beings, — overcom-
                    ing self-­contained positive norms, deprived of universality for varying
                    from one social milieu to another. Those universal rights stand against
                    the arbitrary manifestations of State power, in acknowledgement of the
                    importance of fundamental principles of international law 109, which have
                    so much been influencing the evolution, along more than the last seven
                    decades, of the international law of human rights 110.

                    recta ratio, giving expression to universal values, and advancing a wide
                    conception of international legal personality (including human beings,
                    and humankind as a whole) 112; this can render viable to address more

                    of justice 116. The advances of the international legal order correspond to
                    the awareness of human conscience to the need of realization of the com-
                    mon good and justice.

                    national law are essential for the prevalence of rights. The positivists mis-
                    takenly identified the principles with the norms emanating therefrom,
                    indulging into the confusion between what it is (Sein) and what it should
                    be (Sollen). They opted for a static vision of the world, entirely ignoring
                    its temporal dimension; moreover, they isolated law from other areas of
                    human knowledge. Regrettably, positivists and “realists” are numerous
                    today, what accounts for the worrisome decline in the cultivation of the
                    knowledge of law. They remain oblivious of the fact that the use of force
                    projects itself, leading to the decomposition of the social tissue, and to the
                    grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 117,


                       72. One cannot simply resort to violence utilizing its own methods 118.
                    Legal positivism and “realism” have regrettably been invariably subservi-
                    ent to power, unable to understand and accept the profound transforma-
                    tions of contemporary international law in seeking the realization of the
                    imperatives of justice. Whenever their minimization prevailed the results
                    have been disastrous. The emancipation of human persons v­ is-à-vis their
                    own State and the emancipation of peoples in the law of nations have
                    occurred before the lack of awareness of legal positivists and “realists”,
                    who wrongly pretended that the reality over which they worked was per-

                    ity before the changes, they had to move from one historical moment to
                    another one, entirely different.
                       73. In my perception, their basic mistake has been their minimization
                    of the principles 119, which lie on the foundations of any legal system
                    (national and international), and which inform and conform the new

                    legal order in the search for the realization of justice. May I here recall
                    that, as Jacques Maritain rightly warned already in 1940, the temporal
                    dimension of social facts and the imperatives of ethics and justice, together
                    with the general principles of law (the principles of natural law) are to be
                    kept in mind 120, so as to construct a new international legal order in
                    opposition to violence and the use of force.
                       74. Voluntarist positivism was unable to explain the process of forma-
                    tion of the norms of general international law. And “realists” focused

                    manent factor”, — as criticized by Hersch Lauterpacht, — which led
                    them soon to “disapprove” the idea of collective security, early in the era
                    of the United Nations; they could only see interests and advantages,
                    and did not seem to believe in human reason, in recta ratio, not even in
                    the capacity of human beings to extract lessons from historical experi-
                    ence 121.


                         VII. The Universal Juridical Conscience in the Rejection of
                                    Voluntarism and “Countermeasures”

                       75. For those who dedicate themselves to the law of nations, it has
                    become evident that one can only properly approach its foundations and
                    validity as from universal juridical conscience, in conformity with the recta
                    ratio. In my understanding, the true jusinternationalist thinking conceives
                    international law as being endowed with its own intrinsic value, and being
                    thus certainly superior to a simply “voluntary” law. It derives its author-
                    ity from recta ratio itself (est dictatum rectae rationis), which has always
                    called for a truly universal law of nations.

                      76. As just seen (Part VI, supra), the evolution itself of the law of

                    over the “will” 122 (supra). By contrast, legal positivism statically focused
                    rather on the “will” of States. Humankind as subject of international law
                    cannot at all be restrictively visualized from the optics of States only;
                    definitively, what imposes itself is to recognize the limits of States as from
                    the optics of humankind, this latter likewise being a subject of contempo-
                    rary international law.
                      77. It is clear that human conscience stands well above the “will”. The

                    (droit des gens) are grounded on recta ratio, and are guided by general
                    principles of law and human values. Law and justice are interrelated, they
                    evolve together. It is regrettable that the great majority of practitioners in

                    realizing the importance of fundamental principles and superior human
                    values.
                       78. Voluntarism and positivism have by themselves rendered a disser-
                    vice to international law. So-­called “countermeasures” are an example of
                    deconstruction ensuing therefrom, which should not appeal in legal prac-
                    tice. It is regrettable that, in the present proceedings, as seen (supra), the
                    appellant States invoked “countermeasures” in both cases of ICAOA and
                    ICAOB — an initiative that could and should have been avoided and is
                    not to be repeated.

                                    of Law in the Foundations of the New
                                                Jus Gentium

                       79. In sequence, there are some remaining interrelated points to be
                    here addressed, so as to complement the present considerations, namely:
                    first, basic considerations of humanity in the corpus juris gentium; sec-
                    ondly, human suffering and the need of protection to victims; and thirdly,

                    construction. After all, to the jurist is reserved a role of crucial impor-
                    tance in the current strengthening of the construction, in conformity with
                    the recta ratio, of the new jus gentium of our times, the universal law of
                    humankind 123.

                         1. Basic Considerations of Humanity in the Corpus Juris Gentium
                       80. In historical perspective, as seen, two (legal) reasonings can be per-
                    ceived: one, attentive to principles and values, to the ineluctable interrela-
                    tionship between law and justice; the other, attentive to authority and
                    imposition or control, to the ineluctable relationship between law and

                    years, conforms a corpus juris gentium nowadays orienting law and justice
                    together to the satisfaction of the needs and aspirations of human beings,
                    of peoples and of humankind as a whole. On the basis of the experience
                    accumulated in recent decades, there is no reason for limitation to posi-

                    tive (international) law. The international community cannot prescind from
                    universal values.

                       81. The traditional inter-State outlook of international law has surely

                    encompassing nowadays, besides States, international organizations,
                    individuals and peoples, as well as humankind. The conditions are thus
                    met for keeping on advancing the construction of a new jus gentium,
                    keeping in mind the social needs and aspirations of the international com-
                    munity (civitas maxima gentium), of humankind as a whole, so as to pro-
                    vide responses to fulfil them. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge the
                    importance of fundamental principles of international law, in light of the
                    universal conception of the law of nations.
                       82. Contemporary international law bears witness of a legitimate con-
                    cern of the international community as a whole with the conditions of

                    basic considerations of humanity in the whole corpus juris of contempo-
                    rary international law, reflecting the humanization of this latter 124. This
                    evolution, in the lines of the continued universalization and humanization
                    of the law of nations, is faithful to the thinking of the “founding fathers”
                    of the discipline (supra), attentive nowadays to the needs and aspirations
                    of the international community, and of humankind as a whole.


                             2. Human Suffering and the Need of Protection to Victims
                       83. The evolving law of nations cannot make abstraction of human

                    human suffering. In this connection, may I recall that, in the mid-­
                    twentieth century, shortly after the Second World War, a learned histo-
                    rian, Arnold Joseph Toynbee, observed that the works of artists and
                    academicians “outlive the deeds of businessmen, soldiers, and statesmen”,
                    and further pondered that
                            “The ghosts of Agamemnon and Pericles haunt the living world of
                         today by grace of the magic words of Homer and Thucydides (. . .).
                         The experience that we were having in our world now had been expe-
                         rienced by Thucydides in his world already. (. . .) The prophets,
                         through their own experience, anticipated Aeschylus’ discovery that

                         and circumstances, have been making too. (. . .) Civilizations rise and
                         fall and, in falling, give rise to others.” 125

                               No known civilization has ever reached the goal of civilization
                               yet.” 127

                       85. Toynbee then regretted that “contradictions and paradoxes in the
                    life of the world” at that time looked like “symptoms of serious social and
                    spiritual sickness” 128. And he concluded that “man’s only dangers (. . .)
                    have come from man himself”; after all, the truth facing us is that “in this
                    world we do learn by suffering”, and that “life in this world is not an end
                    in itself and by itself” 129. Such were his words in 1948, as a learned and
                    sensitive historian. By that time the law of nations was already engaged in
                    assuring the vindication of the rights of human beings also at interna-
                    tional level.

                    of nations itself expressed concern for humankind, as exemplified by the
                    adoption, successively, in that same year, e.g. of the OAS American Dec-
                    laration of the Rights and Duties of Man (adopted on 2 May 1948), of
                    the UN Convention against Genocide (adopted on 9 December 1948),
                    and of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted
                    on 10 December 1948). The international law of human rights was at last
                    seeing the light of the day, enhancing the position of human beings and
                    their inherent rights in the corpus juris gentium from those historical
                    moments onwards.

                    with the notion of law (finding no words for it), concentrated thus on

                        88. One decade earlier, Simone Weil had written Réflexions sur les
                    causes de la liberté et de l’oppression sociale (1934) [English translation
                    entitled Oppression and Liberty, 1958], wherein, after recalling the lessons
                    found in Homer’s Iliad (eighth century bc), then warned that “the
                    ­essential evil besetting humankind” (le mal essentiel de l’humanité) is “the

                     human history thus distorted, — she proceeded, — becomes subjection
                     [servitude, asservissement], and such an oppression presents “nothing
                     providential”, it reflects a struggle for power, wherein construction
                     and destruction are intermingled 131 (pp. 41‑43 and 46). Weil further pon-
                    dered that
                          “[e]very oppressive society is cemented by this religion of power,

                        89. Also in our days, legal positivists do not appear to be aware even
                     of the dangers of the unbalance between law and justice in their own out-
                    look. They can behold only the first one, — law, — in their characteristic
                     subservience to the established power. The results have been regrettable,
                     if not tragic. All those devoted to international law in its universality feel
                     bound to care constantly that law and justice are not at all put apart, they
                     are interrelated and advance together. After all, it is in jusnaturalist think-
                     ing that the notion of justice has always occupied a central position,
                    ­orienting law as a whole. In my own perception and conception, justice

                    unjustly inflicted” upon persons, it is necessary that each person avoids evil and keeps good
                    in her soul, remains away from injustice, and respectfully sustains and transmits justice;

                    is found, in sum, at the beginning of all law, being, moreover, its ultimate
                    end 133.

                       90. The law of nations can only be properly considered together with
                    its foundations, and its basic principles which permeate its whole corpus
                    juris, in line of natural law thinking 134. This has been sustained, along the
                    decades, e.g. by the most lucid Latin American doctrine of international
                    law, from its earlier manifestations in the nineteenth century 135, until

                    As I have been sustaining over the years, basic principles give expression
                    to the values and ultimate ends of the international legal order,

                         “so as to guide it and to protect it against the incongruences of State
                         practice, and to fulfil the needs of the international community
                         itself 137. The principles referred to, in emanating from the human
                         conscience and not from the ‘will’ of States, give expression to the
                         idea of objective justice (in the best line of jusnaturalist thinking), to
                         the benefit of the international community as a whole.” 138

                    law of the ICJ. For example, one decade ago, in my lengthy separate
                    opinion in the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion (of 22 July 2010) on the Accor‑
                    dance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence
                    in Respect of Kosovo, I singled out, inter alia, the relevance of the general
                    principles of international law in the framework of the law of the
                    United Nations, and in relation to the human ends of the State (Advisory
                    Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (II), pp. 594‑607, paras. 177-211), leading
                    furthermore to the overcoming of the strictly inter-State paradigm in con-

                       92. Likewise, on another occasion, in my extensive dissenting opinion
                    in the ICJ’s Judgment (of 1 April 2011) in the case concerning the Appli‑
                    cation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Dis‑
                    crimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), — in which the Court found
                    it had no jurisdiction to examine the application, — I strongly criticized
                    the ICJ’s “outdated voluntarist conception” (emphasizing State consent),
                    and drew attention to “the imperatives of the realization of justice at

                    2011 (I), p. 257, para. 44, and cf. p. 294, para. 127). After addressing the
                    need “to overcome the vicissitudes of the ‘will’ of States” (ibid., p. 314,
                    paras. 188-189), I stressed the importance of general principles of law and
                    fundamental values, standing well above State consent (ibid., p. 316,
                    para. 194) 139.
                       93. I further pointed out that the compromissory clause (Art. 22) of
                    the aforementioned Convention should have been interpreted by the ICJ
                    taking into account its nature and material content, in addition to the
                    object and purpose of the Convention, as a human rights treaty (ibid.,
                    pp. 265-291, paras. 64-118); as it did not do so, it did not contribute to

                    the Hague Academy of International Law in 2017, “the basic posture of
                    an international tribunal can only be principiste, without making undue
                    concessions to State voluntarism” 140. And I added that the general prin-
                    ciples of international law inform and conform the norms and rules of the
                    law of nations, “reflecting the universal juridical conscience; in the evolv-
                    ing jus gentium, basic considerations of humanity are of the utmost
                    importance” 141.

                       94. More recently, the issue again marked its presence in respect of the
                    interrelationship between law and justice orienting jurisprudential con-

                    mentioned Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Separation
                    of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 (of 25 February 2019),

                       139 Such as the fundamental principle of equality and non-­    discrimination, belonging
                    to the realm of jus cogens (para. 195). In the same dissenting opinion, I further recalled
                    that some of the true prima principia confer to the international legal order its ineluctable
                    axiological dimension, reveal the values which inspire the corpus juris of the international
                    legal order, and, ultimately, provide its foundations themselves. Prima principia conform
                    the substratum of the international legal order, conveying the idea of an objective justice
                    (proper of natural law) (paras. 209 and 211-214).

                    I have, inter alia, strongly criticized any attempt to limit the meaning and
                    scope of application of general principles of law; I have pondered that
                             “The addition, in Article 38 (1) (c) of the PCIJ/ICJ Statute, to
                          general principles of law, of the qualification ‘recognized by civilized
                          nations’, was, in my perception, distracted, done without reflection
                          and without a minimal critical spirit, — keeping in mind that in 1920,

                          which are the ‘civilized nations’. No country is to consider itself as
                          essentially ‘civilized’; we can only identify the ones which behave in
                          a ‘civilized’ way for some time, and while they so behave.

                             In my view, the aforementioned qualification was added to the ‘gen-
                          eral principles of law’ in Article 38 of the Statute of the PCIJ in 1920
                          by mental lethargy, and was maintained in the Statute of the ICJ in
                          1945, wherein it remains until now (beginning of 2019), by mental
                          inertia, and without a critical spirit. We ought to have some more
                          courage and humility, much needed, in relation to our human condi-

                          From the ancient Greek tragedies to contemporary ones, human
                          existence has always been surrounded by tragedy. Definitively, there
                          do not exist nations or countries ‘civilized’ per se, but only those
                          which behave in a civilized way for some time, and while they so
                          behave.” 142 (Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2019 (I), pp. 248‑249,

                             “The prevalence of human beings over States marked presence in

                    organized socially in emerging States and conforming humanity; the reparation of viola-
                    tions of their rights reflected an international necessity addressed by the law of nations

                    nals, created for the exercise of the common mission of realization of
                    justice. Overcoming an outdated State voluntarist conception, they have
                    been contributing to the expansion of international jurisdiction, responsi-
                    bility, personality and capacity, to the benefit of humankind, — as I have
                    been pointing out over the years in successive writings 144. The advances
                    achieved so far are due to the awareness that human conscience stands
                    above the “will”.
                       97. May I here furthermore recall that, in my understanding, an inter-
                    national tribunal is entitled, besides settling disputes, to state what the
                    law is (juris dictio), keeping in mind that contemporary international law

                    viduals, as well as humankind 145. It is necessary to keep in mind that
                           “The work of contemporary international tribunals can thus be
                         evaluated from the perspective of the justiciables themselves 146. In
                         pursuing their common objective, reassuring progress has been
                         made . . . again from the perspective of the justiciables. This pres-
                         ent-day development is highly significant, driven by the awakening of
                         human conscience to its importance; and as I have emphasized over

                               the years, human conscience is the ultimate material source of all
                               law . . .
                                  The co-existence of multiple international tribunals in contempo-
                               rary international law has considerably expanded the number of jus‑
                               ticiables, in all parts of the world, even under the most adverse
                               conditions . . . The co-­ordinated and harmonious operation of con-
                               temporary international tribunals is a sign of the times, . . . and of
                               hope for a world with more justice.” 147

                       98. After all, the foundations of international law emanate clearly
                    from human conscience, the universal juridical conscience, and not from
                    the so-­called “will” of individual States. Judicial settlement nowadays
                    extends itself significantly to all domains of contemporary international
                    law, and the present co-­existence of international tribunals has consider-
                    ably enlarged the number of justiciables in all parts of the world even
                    under the most adverse conditions, in an essential and indispensable step
                    to the realization of justice at international level 148.

                       99. In effect, in its case law, the ICJ has not yet devoted sufficient atten-

                    much importance to State “consent”, an attitude that I have constantly
                    criticized. In my understanding, general principles of law are in the foun-
                    dations themselves of international law, being essential for the realization
                    of justice. Moreover, in our times, even the difficulties in the labour of the
                    ICJ in given cases ought to be considered in the larger framework, —
                    besides the expansion of the international jurisdiction, — of the concomi-
                    tant expansion of the international legal personality as well as of the
                    international responsibility, — and the mechanisms of implementation of
                    this latter.
                       100. Such expansion (of international jurisdiction, legal personality

                    ization of international law 149. There have been cases with true advances
                    with the necessary overcoming of persisting difficulties 150, discarding the
                    dogmas of the past. The rights of the human person have been effectively

                                        IX. Epilogue: Final Considerations

                       101. With these considerations in mind, may I now proceed, last but
                    not least, to a brief recapitulation of the main points that I have deemed
                    fit to make, in the present separate opinion, in respect of the lack of foun-
                    dation of so-­called “countermeasures”, as raised by the appellant States
                    in the cas d’espèce. Primus: It may be recalled that, during the 1990s, in
                    the several years of its work on the elaboration followed by the adoption
                    of its Articles on State Responsibility (in 2001), the members of the Inter-
                    national Law Commission consumed much time facing some resistance to

                    measures”, found by some participants as not being in accordance with
                    the foundations of the law of nations.

                       102. Secundus: The same occurred in the corresponding debates of del-
                    egates in the VI Committee of the UN General Assembly, likewise critical
                    of “countermeasures”. Tertius: The awareness of the importance and the
                    prevalence of the imperative of judicial settlement of international dis-
                    putes, and the support for the imperative of such prevalence over the
                    State’s “will”, has found support in international legal thinking as from
                    the beginning of the era of international tribunals.

                    national legal thinking and the prevalence of recta ratio (human con-
                    science) over the “will”. Quintus: In the history of international legal
                    thinking, it is also important to keep in mind that the identification of
                    recta ratio as appeared in the writings of the “founding fathers” of inter-
                    national law during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in the realm
                    of natural law. Sextus: Each subject of law is to behave with justice, in
                    conformity with the principles of recta ratio, which emanate from human
                    conscience, asserting the ineluctable relationship between law and ethics.
                       104. Septimus: Natural law reflects the principles of recta ratio, where
                    justice has its foundations. Octavus: The legal order of the international

                    State, being coextensive with humankind itself. Nonus: The new jus gen‑
                    tium, securing the unity of societas gentium, provided the foundations —
                    emanating from a lex praeceptiva of natural law — for the totus orbis,
                    capable of being found by the recta ratio inherent to humankind.

                       105. Decimus: On the other hand, as from the end of the nineteenth cen-
                    tury and in the first decades of the twentieth century, voluntarist positiv-
                    ism, grounded on the consent or “will” of States, envisaged a strictly

                    consequences against human beings. Undecimus: The present cases
                    (ICAOA and ICAOB) before the ICJ once again show that international
                    adjudication can only be properly undertaken from a humanist perspec-
                    tive, necessarily avoiding the pitfalls of an outdated and impertinent State
                    voluntarist outlook.
                       106. Duodecimus: Recta ratio and the jusnaturalist thinking in interna-
                    tional law have never faded away until our times, as a perennial reaction
                    of human conscience against the subservience and cowardice of legal pos-
                    itivism and the breaches of the rights of human beings. Tertius decimus:
                    The foundations and validity of the law of nations can only be properly

                    the recta ratio.
                       107. Quartus decimus: Human conscience stands well above the “will”
                    of States, and the law of nations is grounded by recta ratio and guided by
                    general principles of law and human values. Quintus decimus: Volun-
                    tarism and positivism have rendered a disservice to international law, and
                    “countermeasures” are an unacceptable deconstruction to be avoided.
                    Sextus decimus: The universal rights of human beings stand against the
                    arbitrary manifestations of State power, in acknowledgement of the
                    importance of fundamental principles of international law.

                    principles of international law are essential for the prevalence of rights;
                    legal positivists mistakenly identified the principles with the norms ema-
                    nating therefrom. Duodevicesimus: Voluntarist positivism was unable to
                    explain the process of formation of the norms of general international
                    law; in effect, the emancipation of human persons ­vis-à-vis their own
                    State as well as of peoples in the law of nations have occurred even before
                    the lack of awareness of legal positivists.
                       109. Undevicesimus: The evolution of the law of nations conforms a
                    corpus juris gentium that has advanced the prevalence of human con-
                    science (recta ratio) over the “will” of States. Vicesimus: The present

                    “countermeasures” provide no legal ground whatsoever for any legal
                    action. Vicesimus primus: It is essential to remain attentive to universal
                    principles and values, to the ineluctable interrelationship between law and
                    justice; the international community cannot prescind from universal prin-
                    ciples and values of the law of nations, in light of the universal conception
                    of the droit des gens.
                       110. Vicesimus secundus: General principles of law are a manifestation
                    of the universal juridical conscience. Vicesimus tertius: The common mis-
                    sion in the work of contemporary international tribunals can be properly
                    appreciated from the perspectives of the justiciables themselves. Vicesimus

                    quartus: The law of nations orients nowadays law and justice together, to
                    the satisfaction of the needs and aspirations of human beings, of peoples

                       111. Vicesimus quintus: The rights of the human person have been
                    effectively marking presence also in the framework of the ICJ’s tradi-
                    tional inter-State contentieux. Vicesimus sextus: Law and justice are inter-
                    related and advance together; after all, it is in jusnaturalist thinking that
                    the notion of justice has always occupied a central position, orienting law
                    as a whole. Vicesimus septimus: The foundations of international law
                    emanate clearly from human conscience, the universal juridical con-
                    science, and not from the so-­called “will” of individual States.

                      112. Vicesimus octavus: On the other hand, legal positivists remain

                    their own outlook, and do not consider the legal effects of their indiffer-
                    ence. Vicesimus nonus: The ICJ cannot remain hostage of State consent; it
                    has to make sure that it is the imperative of realization of justice which
                    prevails. Trigesimus: The traditional inter-State outlook of international
                    law has surely been overcome, with the expansion of international legal
                    personality encompassing nowadays, besides States, international organi-
                    zations, individuals and peoples, as well as humankind.

                       113. Trigesimus primus: Such expansion, characteristic of our times, —
                    encompassing altogether international jurisdiction, legal personality and

                    ing historical process in course of the humanization of international law.
                    Trigesimus secundus: It is important to keep on believing in human rea-
                    son, in recta ratio, and in the capacity of human beings to extract lessons
                    from historical experience, in the permanent endeavours towards the real-
                    ization of justice.
                       114. Trigesimus tertius: After all, it is further to be kept in mind that
                    fundamental principles of law lie on the very foundations of the interna-
                    tional legal system itself, being essential for the realization of justice. Tri‑
                    gesimus quartus: The present cases of ICAOA and ICAOB reveal the
                    importance of the awareness of the historical formation of the law of

                    of justice, which clearly prevails over the “will” of States.
