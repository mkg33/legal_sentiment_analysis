                   1. In one of my opinions I expressed the view that “[t]he courts are
                usually powerless to stop wars” and that they “usually can only sort out
                ex post the legal consequences of the wars provided they have jurisdiction
                over the particular case” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention
                and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.
                ­Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), separate
                 opinion of Judge Tomka, p. 312, para. 3).

                  2. The Court was not able to stop the involvement of Uganda in the
                armed conflict in the territory of the DRC despite its Order of 1 July 2000
                unanimously indicating certain provisional measures. In particular, the
                Court ordered that
                        “[b]oth Parties must, forthwith, prevent and refrain from any action,
                        and in particular any armed action, which might prejudice the rights
                        of the other Party in respect of whatever judgment the Court may
                        render in the case, or which might aggravate or extend the dispute
                        before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve” (Armed Activi-
                        ties on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.
                        Uganda), Provisional Measures, Order of 1 July 2000, I.C.J. Reports
                        2000, p. 129, para. 47 (1)).
                      The Court further ordered that
                        “[b]oth Parties must, forthwith, take all measures necessary to ensure
                        full respect within the zone of conflict for fundamental human rights





6 Ord_1239.indb 259                                                                                  27/06/23 08:16

                                               armed activities (decl. tomka)                                                    141

                      and for the applicable provisions of humanitarian law” (I.C.J. Reports
                      2000, p. 129, para. 47 (3)).

                  3. Even before the Court authoritatively determined that its “orders on
                provisional measures under Article 41 [of the Statute] have binding effect”
                (LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                2001, p. 506, para. 109), it stated that
                      “[w]hen the Court finds that the situation requires that measures of
                      this kind should be taken, it is incumbent on each party to take the
                      Court’s indications seriously into account, and not to direct its con-
                      duct solely by reference to what it believes to be its rights” (Military
                      and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.
                      United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986,
                      p. 144, para. 289).
                And the Court emphasized: “Particularly is this so in a situation of armed
                conflict where no reparation can efface the results of conduct which the
                Court may rule to have been contrary to international law.” (Ibid.)

                  4. In its Judgment on the merits, rendered on 19 December 2005, the
                Court found that Uganda
                         “(1) . . . by engaging in military activities against the Democratic
                      Republic of the Congo on the latter’s territory, by occupying Ituri
                      and by actively extending military, logistic, economic and financial
                      support to irregular forces having operated on the territory of the
                      DRC, violated the principle of non-use of force in international rela-
                      tions and the principle of non-­intervention;

                      �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                          (3) . . . by the conduct of its armed forces, which committed acts
                      of killing, torture and other forms of inhumane treatment of the Con-
                      golese civilian population, destroyed villages and civilian buildings,
                      failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets and to pro-
                      tect the civilian population in fighting with other combatants, trained
                      child soldiers, incited ethnic conflict and failed to take measures to
                      put an end to such conflict; as well as by its failure, as an occupying
                      Power, to take measures to respect and ensure respect for human
                      rights and international humanitarian law in Ituri district, violated its
                      obligations under international human rights law and international
                      humanitarian law;



                        (4) . . . by acts of looting, plundering and exploitation of Congolese

                      forces in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
                      by its failure to comply with its obligations as an occupying Power in
                      Ituri district to prevent acts of looting, plundering and exploitation
                      of Congolese natural resources, violated obligations owed to the
                      Democratic Republic of the Congo under international law” (Armed
                      Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the
                      Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, pp. 280‑281,
                      para. 345 (1), (3) and (4)).

                  5. The Court also found that “Uganda did not comply with the Order
                of the Court on provisional measures of 1 July 2000” (ibid., p. 281,
                para. 345 (7)).
                  6. The failure of Uganda to comply with the Order on provisional
                measures led to significant losses of human life, serious personal injuries,
                displacement of populations, serious material damage and looting, plun-
                dering and unlawful exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC.

                   7. It was the task of the Court, in the present phase of the case, to
                “sort out ex post the legal consequences” of the unlawful use of force by
                Uganda and its unlawful intervention in the DRC, as well as of the other
                serious violations of its obligations under international law mentioned
                above. I doubt that the Court fully succeeded in this task. The amount of
                compensation awarded, in particular for personal injury (damage to per-
                sons) and damage to property, in my view, does not reflect the scale of the
                damage Uganda inflicted on the DRC and its people during the almost
                five years of its unlawful military activities. The amount of compensation
                awarded is not commensurate with the extent of the suffering and losses
                caused by Uganda’s breach of the fundamental rule of international law
                prohibiting the use of force in international relations and the serious vio-
                lations of its obligations under international humanitarian law and inter-
                national human rights law.

                   9. Article 56, paragraph 1, of the Statute requires that the judgment
                shall state the reasons on which it is based. The reasons should allow the
                reader to understand how the Court reached its conclusions. I doubt that
                the reader will be able to understand how the Court arrived at the par-
                ticular amounts of compensation for various heads of damages. While the

                                      armed activities (decl. tomka)                        143

                Court does not spare the reports of the Secretary‑General of the
                United Nations on the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
                Congo and the report of the Court‑appointed experts from criticism, tak-
                ing issue in particular with their methodologies, in the end the Court itself
                does not indicate any precise methodology by which it has arrived at the
                amount of compensation it has awarded. Instead, the Court is content to
                repeat that
                      “it may, under the exceptional circumstances of the present case,
                      award compensation in the form of a global sum, within the range of
                      possibilities indicated by the evidence and taking into account equi-
                      table considerations” (Judgment, paras. 166, 181, 193, 206, 225, 258
                      and 365).
                This incantation hardly satisfies the requirement of providing the reasons
                for the Court’s Judgment.
                    10. I have voted against the Court’s decision that the compensation
                due by Uganda to the DRC shall be paid in five instalments over a period
                of five years. The Court fixed the amount of compensation at the moment
                of rendering its Judgment, asserting that “in determining the amount to
                be awarded for each head of damage, it has taken into account the
                ­passage of time” (ibid., para. 401). For that reason, it considered that
                 there was no need to award pre‑judgment interest. When determining
                 post‑judgment interest at 6 per cent, it decided that such interest shall
                 accrue from the day following the day on which the instalment was due
                 (ibid., para. 406). This decision, however, does not take into account that,
                 with the passage of time, the real value of the compensation awarded and
                 still remaining to be paid in instalments, will diminish due to inflation and
                 the decrease in the purchasing power of the US dollar. Assuming that
                 inflation in this five‑year period will be at around 6 per cent (the interest
                 determined by the Court), the real value of the compensation awarded
                 will significantly decrease (by up to US$39,000,000). While the DRC and
                 Uganda would have been free to agree on the conditions for a possible
                 payment of the compensation in instalments, the Court’s decision —
                 without protecting the value of the compensation awarded — is not, in
                 my view, fair to the Applicant.

                   11. I cannot agree with the decision of the majority to reject the DRC’s
                claim to be reimbursed by Uganda for the costs it incurred in the context of
                the present case. It is true that Article 64 of the Statute of the Court provides
                that “[u]nless otherwise decided by the Court, each party shall bear its own
                costs”. The Statute thus gives a power to the Court to award costs “when it
                is called upon to do so, [and] after careful consideration of the particular
                circumstances of the case” (Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in
                the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in
                Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), Judgment,
                I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), joint declaration of Judges Tomka, Greenwood,
                Sebutinde and Judge ad hoc Dugard, p. 754, para. 2). As the victim of an





6 Ord_1239.indb 265                                                                                 27/06/23 08:16

                                    armed activities (decl. tomka)                       144

                unlawful use of force, with part of its territory occupied for an extended
                period and whose population suffered, the DRC had to seek protection and
                to vindicate its rights in this Court. The Respondent was found in breach of
                important international law obligations. Moreover, the Court found in its
                2005 Judgment that Uganda did not comply with its Order on provisional
                measures of 1 July 2000. During the negotiations on reparations, Uganda
                offered a mere US$25,500,000, later increasing its offer to US$37,028,368.
                The DRC had no choice but to return to the Court. The long period of
                active litigation of the case before the Court between 1999 and 2005 and
                again between 2015 and 2021 no doubt entailed substantial costs for the
                DRC. These costs were certainly several times higher than the value of
                Uganda’s counter‑claim, worth less than US$1 million, which the DRC in
                its Counter‑Memorial on reparations accepted (p. 5, para. 2.03), and the
                waiver of which by Uganda is given by the Court as a reason for not
                “departing . . . from the general rule” (Judgment, para. 396). All these cir-
                cumstances militate in favour of granting the request. However, to my
                regret, the Court did not even wish to receive the DRC’s statement of costs
                following the closure of the oral proceedings.

                  12. This was not an ordinary case concerning a maritime delimitation
                dispute or the interpretation of a treaty in which the Court provides a
                service to both parties. This was a case about Uganda unlawfully engag-
                ing in military activities against the DRC on the latter’s territory, occupy-
                ing one of its districts and actively extending military, logistic, economic
                and financial support to irregular forces which operated on the territory
                of the DRC, as found in point (1) of the dispositif of the 2005 Judgment.
                Significant damage was caused to the DRC and its people. If any case
                calls for the reimbursement of the reasonable amount of the Applicant’s
                costs of legal representation, it is this one. Unfortunately, the opening
                phrase in Article 64 of the Statute “[u]nless otherwise decided” remains a
                dead letter.
