The Court in part gives satisfaction to the claim of Portugal. It
recognizes that when India decided to oppose the communications
between the Portuguese territories of Daman, Dadra and Nagar-
Aveli, Portugal had a right of passage over Indian territory to
ensure these communications to the extent necessary for the
exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves of Dadra and
Nagar-Aveli. But the Court takes the view that this right relates
only to the transit of private persons, civil officials and goods in
general and not to that of armed forces, armed police and arms and
ammunition. I cannot agree with that differentiation, which appears
to me to be artificial and unfounded, in fact and in law. I am conse-
quently in disagreement also with the conclusion reached in the
Judgment, that India has not acted contrary to its obligations
resulting from Portugal's right.

Underlying the present case is the essential fact that Portugal is
sovereign of the two enclaves of Dadra and Nagar-Aveli situated
inside Indian territory. The Judgment rests upon that essential fact
and it finds (a) that the exclusive authority of Portugal over these
enclaves was never questioned and (b) that Portuguese sovereignty
over them was recognized by the successive rulers of the surrounding
territory, that is to say, the British from 1818 until 1947 and India
after it gained its independence.

It is evident that Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves could
not have existed all that time and could not continue to exist
today if there were no right of transit in favour of Portugal and no
corresponding obligation incumbent on India; the purpose of that
right and obligation is to ensure the essential communications with
the enclaves to the extent necessary for exercise of the sovereignty
upon which they depend.

The Court arrives at the conclusion that Portugal is indeed the
possessor of a right of transit for communication with the enclaves,
but with one restriction: that right includes the passage of private
persons, civil officials and goods in general to the extent necessary
for the exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over these territories,

but does not include the passage of armed forces, armed police and
arms and ammunition.

Sovereignty over any territory implies the capacity to exercise
public authority in that territory. It implies the right and the obli-
gation to maintain order there, if necessary manu militari. Lastly it
implies the discharge of police duties. In the particular case of the
Portuguese enclaves, how would that authority, that right and
obligation and those duties be exercised if a right of access to the
enclaves were not recognized for armed forces, armed police and
arms and ammunition?

2. Portugal is claiming a fotal right of passage in respect of what
is necessary for the exercise of its sovereignty over the enclaves.
Portuguese Counsel more than once emphasized this aspect of the
Portuguese claim. They said, for example, at the hearing on 25 Sep-
tember 1959: “that right must be. viewed in the round, in rela-
tion to its purpose, which was to ensure liaison with the enclaves
to the extent necessary for the effective exercise of Portuguese
sovereignty’ (Oral Proceedings (Merits), Vol. I, p. 110).

In its final Submissions Portugal presents its claim to a right of
passage as a whole and India disputes it in the same fashion.

For these reasons I am not in agreement with the method that has
been followed of making a separate analysis of the Portuguese claim
according to the various categories dealt with in the Judgment:
private persons, civil officials, goods in general, armed forces,
armed police and arms and ammunition.

With particular regard to armed forces, armed police and arms
and ammunition Portugal has made it plain that the only right it
claimed was to send into the enclaves the elements of the public
forces necessary for the maintenance of order, that is, for the dis-
charge of police duties. “There is no doubt whatsoever”, it was
said at the hearing of 1 October 1959, “that the right of passage
claimed by Portugal is limited to certain elements of the public
forces responsible for maintaining order.” That duty may sometimes


RIGHT OF PASSAGE (Drss. OPIN. OF JUDGE FERNANDES) 125

be entrusted to forces not part of what is usually called police, in-
cluding military elements, but that does not alter the essential fact
that they are performing a police duty. From the point of view of
international law, what matters is the function and not the admini-
strative organization of the public force, which is a matter within
the exclusive competencé of the State. This consideration is
important to a proper understanding of the nature and content of
the right claimed by Portugal.

3. My third and last preliminary observation is that Portugal,
as I see it, did not apply to the Court for recognition of a right
it claimed to possess in the past. In its final Submissions of 6 Oc-
tober 1959 it asks the Court to adjudge and declare ‘‘that the
right of passage ... és a right possessed by Portugal and which
must be respected by India”. “Is a right” and “must be respected”,
that is to say at the present time, on the day on which the Sub-
missions were filed.

4. The facts regarding the passage of elements of the public
forces between Daman and the enclaves, facts which were illu-
strated by an abundance of documents filed with the Court, are
indicated in the following paragraphs.

5. Examination of the evidence permits of one general state-
ment which is certain beyond doubt: these elements of the public
forces passed between the three pieces of territory forming the
Portuguese district of Daman practically daily, with no obstruction
at all, from the time when the enclaves were acquired by Portugal
in 1783 and 1785 until July 1954. It was not until this last date
that, for the first time in history, this transit was prevented by the
Government of India. Until then these organs of the Portuguese
public force had in no single case been refused passage, whether
they were individuals or whether they were in more or less large
parties. That is highly significant.

6. In the Maratha period (1785-1818) passage of the public
forces was effected as a right.

A question discussed at great length by the Parties during the
proceedings dealt with the legal character of the concession granted
by the Marathas to the Portuguese under a treaty of 1779.

Portugal argues that this treaty conferred upon it sovereignty
over the territories making up the enclaves of Dadra and Nagar-


RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE FERNANDES) 126


I do not agree, but I do not propose to prolong this opinion
by a discussion of this question, since it seems to me unnecessary
. in order to establish the existence, today as in the past, of the
right of passage claimed by Portugal for its public forces.

It is sufficient for my purpose to record the Court’s finding
that Portugal has been for a long time the undisputed sovereign
of the enclaves. That is what is important in order to determine

7. Nevertheless, the fact that I refrain from discussing the
legal character of the concession accorded to the Portuguese by
the Treaty of 1779 does not prevent me from repeating the
statement already made, namely that the passage of armed forces
was exercised as a right throughout the Maratha period from the
very day on which the Portuguese took possession of the enclaves.

the saranjam) not only the right to collect taxes, but also the right
and the duty to administer the territory in the widest sense. The
Peshwa’s sovereignty was hardly more than nominal. Moreover, it
has been shown that in those days and in those territories sovereign-
ty amounted to very little. Its essential attribute was the collection
of taxes.

8. An agreement of 1785, intended to settle certain questions
arising out of the transfer of the villages to the Portuguese, acknow-
ledged in their favour full powers over these villages. Sovereign
powers, as I call them; saranjamdar powers, according to those
who do not share my opinion on the scope of the 1779 Treaty. The
point is of small importance. What matters—this no one can deny
in view of the express terms of the 1785 Agreement and the later
sanads—is that the Portuguese were given full administration and
jurisdiction over the territories transferred with authority to collect
taxes, administer justice, pursue criminals, maintain order, suppress
rebellions, etc.

attacks by the Marathas themselves (Memorial, Annexes 9-13;
Reply, Annexes 42 and 43).

9. The question then arises, what became of this right of transit
(assuming that it was only a saranjam) after the Portuguese secured
full sovereignty over the enclaves? Did it thereby disappear? It
would be absurd to suppose so. The reinforcement of the title under
which the Portuguese exercised their exclusive authority over the
enclaves (admitted in the Judgment), the conversion of an accessory

a greater content and greater mandatory force in its transformation
from a right for the purpose of exercising the powers of a saranjam-
dar into a right for the purpose of exercising sovereignty. That is
all that needs to be said about the facts and their legal implication
during the Maratha period.

“... The fact ... is that before 1879 the entry of troops or armed
police of either Government into the territory of the other was
governed by a reciprocal arrangement. The existence of such an
arrangement made it unnecessary for a formal request to be made
and permission to be granted on each occasion of entry.”

I need only point out that any existing agreement of this kind
must have been a tacit one (giving rise to custom), since there is no
trace of any express agreement.

enter into the territories of the other in India without a formal
request to do so. Police might enter without that request only in
pursuit of criminals or smugglers.

These provisions did not in my opinion apply to the particular
passage between Daman and the enclaves. The records contain a
large number of documents (Reply, Annexes 50-76) showing that
this passage continued to take place, at any rate until 1890, with
no need for an authorization.

It was only in December 1890 (twelve years after the date of the
treaty) that the British authorities considered that permission
was necessary for the transit of armed troops and of Portuguese
police between Daman and the enclaves. They adopted this attitude
by way of reprisal against the Portuguese action in disarming a
British detachment which had entered the Portuguese territory
of Goa without permission in accordance with the treaty.

But the fact that the same Governor-General adds three lines
lower down that: “For centuries has this practice been followed”,
whereas the enclaves had been contiguous to British territory for
only 72 years, obliges us to suppose that the Governor-General was
not referring to transit between Daman and the enclaves, but to
the general case of entry by the Portuguese into British territory
from their earlier possessions in the Indian Peninsula.

In any event, it is significant that the British police, with
reference to the Portuguese Governor's letter, declared in 1891 that
they had ‘no orders to prevent armed men of the Portuguese Govern-
ment ... from passing through British territory on duty” without
obtaining permission. And they added: “The Superintendent of
Police is of opinion that the present arrangements should be allowed
to continue.” The Northern District Commissioner expressed his
agreement with the police that ‘the present arrangement is con-
venient and might be allowed to continue” (Rejoinder, Annexes,
p. 223). This shows that there were special arrangements for the
passage of armed police between Daman and the enclaves and that
these arrangements allowed passage without permission in dero-
gation from the rule in Article XVIII of the Treaty of 1878.

duced on pages 305-309 of the Annexes to the Counter-Memorial,
it is to be inferred that the agreement confirmed the earlier practice
in the sense that previous notification was all that was required.

An agreement of 1920 made passage by armed police below a
certain rank subject to prior permission (Indian Annex C. No. 56).
This is the first time that this requirement was stated in an agree-

ment between the Parties since the denunciation of the Treaty of
1878.

without previous permission was the rule and that the need for
permission was the exception. That, however, does not alter the
fact that permission was needed at certain times. But that does not
in my opinion authorize the conclusion that the right of transit
did not exist. I desire to justify my statement. For the moment I
will only observe that, whenever authorization was needed, it was
invariably granted, without exception, and that the British never
had any intention of refusing it. À letter sent by the Governor-

the ability to exercise it. What does need recalling, having regard
to the doctrine underlying the Judgment, is the fact that, if there
are authorizations which genuinely constitute rights, there are more
which do not. It cannot be asserted that the necessity of an authori-


RIGHT OF PASSAGE (piss. OPIN. OF JUDGE FERNANDES) 130

zation is a negation of a right of more ancient date. Such an affirma-

tion in public law, especially administrative law.

15. “The authorization is the administrative act by which the
authority removes in each case the limitations imposed by rules of
law upon the exercise, by a given subject, of a right or power
already belonging to the subject himself to exercise a certain activity
or perform a legal act, such exercise or performance being assessed
in the light of the public interest which it is the duty of the authority
to safeguard.” (Ortolani in Scritts giuridici in onore di Santi Romano,

necessity for it cannot be made equivalent to non-existence of the
right. On the contrary, it normally presumes the existence of an
earlier right.

“The right exists before issue of the permissive act”, De Fran-
cesco says (L’ammmissione nella classificazione degli atti amministrativi,
p. 83). And he adds: “The administrative act simply consents to
the exercise of what already exists” (¢bid., p. 88). From this he
infers: “The act of the authority functions as a condition of the

a contract. It does not create rights, it only conditions their
exercise.

16. Looked at in another aspect, authorization is an act of
control, of that control over the exercise of its right of passage
which Portugal admits that India possesses.

“The control exercised by means of the authorization—says
Donati—is designed only to recognize and declare that a certain
behaviour on the part of a subject of law is in accordance with

regulations and expediency.

A few examples will suffice.

The ownership of land necessarily implies the right to build
upon it. What legal systems do not require a permit for such

to enter that domain to gather fruit from a tree situated on its
border, the owner cannot refuse him the necessary authorization.
So, too, if the neighbour needs to erect scaffolding in the boundary
area between the two properties in order to put up some building
or undertake repairs on his own estate. These are rights which the
neighbour possesses before obtaining an authorization. The law
recognizes his rights, but it also makes their exercise dependent
upon consent by another. That consent can be made subject to

case in history, since the Treaty of Westphalia, where a right of
passage was not recognized in favour of an enclave (including the
passage of armed forces), that study, I say, shows that treaties have
adopted three systems for regulating the exercise of that right.

Sometimes a prior authorization was necessary, sometimes a mere
notification of passage was enough, sometimes again very strict and
detailed regulations were agreed upon, which made the request for

establish another equally effective means of control. A case in point
is the German-Polish Convention on Freedom of Transit signed in
Paris on 21 April 1921. This Convention regulated military transit
across Poland between East Prussia and the rest of Germany so
strictly and in such detail that any authorization became unneces-

The Chicago Convention of 7 December 1944, to which nearly all
nations have acceded, lays down in.its Article 5:

“Each contracting State agrees that all aircraft of the other

require landing and, in special cases, an application for prior per-
mission. This requirement of permission does not mean that foreign
aircraft have not the right to fly over “regions without adequate
air navigation facilities’, it means only that authorization may be
required for the exercise of that right.

22. Another instance is furnished by the Charter itself. Article 43
provides that: “All Members of the United Nations ... undertake to
make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance
with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance
and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose
of maintaining international peace and security.” The forces in the
service of the United Nations have therefore a right of passage over
the territory of Member States. Can that right be exercised without

agreement is needed to which that State is a party. But the latter
cannot lawfully refuse to subscribe to that agreement unless for a
reason which the Security Council deems valid.

23. I think I have now proved my point that the need for an
authorization in order that police or other forces may pass through
foreign territory is in no way incompatible with the existence of a
right of passage of older date than this authorization. This clearly
means that the right of the State passed through to require an
authorization before its territory is traversed does not necessarily
imply a discretionary power to grant the passage or refuse it.

Its purpose being to establish that the conditions regulating
exercise of a right are satisfied and that in each case no injury is
