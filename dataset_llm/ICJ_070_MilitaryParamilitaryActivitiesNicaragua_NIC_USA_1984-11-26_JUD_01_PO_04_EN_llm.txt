While dissenting on many vital points from the Judgment, I nevertheless
concur in the conclusion the Court has reached in paragraph 113 (1) (c) that
it has jurisdiction to entertain the case solely because I cannot, with
confidence, hold in respect of the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce
and Navigation between Nicaragua and the United States any view dif-
ferent from the interpretation given by the Judgment.

Yet this Treaty was not mentioned at all in Nicaragua’s Application and
was scarcely discussed during the oral proceedings, except for a single
reference by the Agent to the Treaty as “a subsidiary basis for the Court’s
jurisdiction” ; neither am I confident that the Court has sufficiently satis-
fied itself that a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this
Treaty — which is of a commercial nature — exists or that, if any dispute
does exist, diplomatic negotiations have been tried and have failed to
adjust it (see Treaty, Art. XXIV, para. 2). I am afraid that the Court might
seem in danger of inviting a case “through the back door”. So it should be
understood that a case brought under the 1956 Treaty must be more strictly
limited in scope than that brought by Nicaragua’s original Application. In
other words, the present case could be sustained only as far as any vio-
lations of specific provisions of that Treaty are proved.

Furthermore, in depending on this Treaty as one of the bases for juris-
diction, the Court seems implicitly to concede that Article 36, paragraph 2,
read with paragraph 5, of its Statute does not provide a solid foundation. It
is true that in the case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular
Staff in Tehran the Court based its jurisdiction on two different sources,
but it did so for reasons which have no parallel in the present case, so that
the Judgments reference to this alleged precedent constitutes a highly
misleading application of the Court’s jurisprudence.

In view of the unduly short time allowed to Judges in the present case for
expounding their separate or dissenting opinions, I cannot, to my great
regret, cover all the issues over which I am in disagreement with the
Judgment. I confine myself therefore, in the main, to expressing my views,
which are quite contrary to those of the Judgment, with regard to Article
36, paragraph 2, read with paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Court, since
these provisions, which are the basis of the so-called system of the Optional
Clause or of compulsory jurisdiction, raise issues of interpretation and
application that are so important that the future of the Court might well
depend upon them.

Chapter 1. Nicaragua’s Declaration of 1929 for
Acceptance of the Optional Clause


Nicaragua became a Member of the League of Nations on 3 November
1920 !. On 13 December of that year it joined the other Members in a
unanimous resolution approving, as amended, the draft Statute of the
Permanent Court of International Justice and providing for a Protocol of
Signature whereby States would declare their “recognition of this Statute”.
The Protocol was so worded as to render this recognition meaningful and
effective by, first, bringing the Statute into force through ratification by the
majority of League Members and, second, securing from League Members
declarations “that they accept[ed] the jurisdiction of the Court in accor-
dance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the above-mentioned
Statute”. The Protocol continued in the following terms :

“The present Protocol ... is subject to ratification. Each Power
shail send its ratification to the Secretary-General of the League of
Nations ; the latter shall take the necessary steps to notify such
ratification to the other signatory Powers. The ratification shall be
deposited in the archives of the Secretariat of the League of Nations.”
(P.C.1J., Series D, No. I, 4th ed, p. 7.)

Ratification of the Protocol was thus essential both for the creation of
the Permanent Court and for conferring upon it jurisdiction ratione per-
sonae. It can accordingly be concluded that a State, even if it had parti-
cipated in the resolution of 13 December 1920 and even if it remained a
Member of the League of Nations, could not be held to have accepted the
jurisdiction of the Court in the minimal sense indicated above unless or
until it had both signed and ratified the Protocol, which became open for
signature only three days after the adoption of the resolution.

Nicaragua did sign the Protocol of Signature, but not until 14 September
1929, when it also signed the Protocol relating to the revision of the Statute
of the Court. There is, however, as the Judgment makes abundantly clear,
no evidence that it ever provided an instrument of ratification for deposit
in the archives of the League Secretariat. On the other hand, various
documents submitted to the Court indicate that between 1934 and 1939
Nicaragua internally carried out domestic formalities for the ratification of
the Protocol of the Statute. Externally, on 29 November 1939, the Ministry

! Nicaragua later announced on 26 June 1936 that it would withdraw from the
League, and this withdrawal became effective as of 26 June 1938 (League of Nations,
Official Journal, 17th Year, Nos. 8-9 (1936), p. 923).



of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua sent the following telegram to the Secre-
tary-General of the League of Nations :

[English translation]

“Statute and Protocol Permanent Court International Justice The
Hague have already been ratified. Will send you in due course instru-
ment ratification — Relations.”

The Acting Legal Adviser to the League of Nations acknowledged
receipt of the telegram on 30 November 1939, and stated :

“En réponse, je m’empresse de vous informer que le service com-
pétent du Secrétariat se tient à la disposition de votre Gouvernement
pour lui faciliter les formalités relatives au dépôt dudit instrument de
ratification.” (Ann. No. 23 to United States Counter-Memorial.)

The Secretariat of the League of Nations did not, however, receive the
instrument of ratification thereafter. In his letter of 15 September 1942 to
Judge Manley O. Hudson, the Acting Legal Adviser stated :

“We have not received the ratification necessary to complete the
signature of the Court Protocol and at the same time to bring into
force the obligations concerning Article 36. But on November 29th,
1939, the Secretary-General was informed by a telegram that the
Court Protocol was ratified by the President of the Republic of
Nicaragua. We have however never received the instrument of rati-
fication itself, which should have been sent to us. Nicaragua is there-
fore not bound either by the Protocol or by the optional clause.” (Ann.
No. 25 to United States Counter-Memorial.)

Nicaragua’s Memorial (para. 86) concedes that : “The instrument of
ratification of the Protocol of Signature appears not to have been deposi-
ted.” Annex I to the Memorial states :

“In connection with this proceeding, the Government of Nicaragua
has undertaken investigations in the official archives of Nicaragua. To
date, no evidence has been uncovered that the instrument of ratifi-
cation of the Protocol of Signature to the Statute of the Permanent
Court of International Justice was forwarded to Geneva.”

The Agent of Nicaragua stated :

“World War II, which was then in full progress, and the attacks on
commercial shipping may explain why the instruments appear never
to have arrived at the Registry of the Permanent Court.” (Hearing of
8 October 1984.)



Thus Nicaragua itself seems to recognize that the instrument of ratification
of the Protocol was not deposited, as it should have been, with the Sec-
retariat of the League of Nations.

Nicaragua has suggested that this defect in the process of recognizing the
Statute and accepting the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice can be attributed to the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939.
However, what is of concern in the present case is not whether the ne-
cessary ratification could have been deposited by any fixed date in 1939.
Even if one acknowledges the serious situation in Europe as from 1939, it is
difficult to suppose that Nicaragua would not, at some time up to 1945,
have been able to cure the defect if it persisted in the intention of becoming
a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.


Nicaragua had thus gone only half way towards “recognition of the
Statute” (in the language of the 1920 resolution) or “acceptance of the
jurisdiction” (in that of the Protocol) when, on 24 September 1929, the
following declaration was made in accordance with the so-called Optional
Clause :

“On behalf of the Republic of Nicaragua I recognize as compulsory
unconditionally the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice.”

Article 36 of the Permanent Court’s Statute provided that such decla-
rations might be made “either when signing or ratifying the Protocol” of
Signature “or at a later moment”. In Nicaragua’s case the moment chosen
was ten days after signature of the Protocol, which strongly suggests that it
fully intended, at that period, to complete all the processes whereby it
would have recognized the Statute and accepted the jurisdiction of the
Permanent Court — accepted it, what is more, as compulsory without
condition. Failing ratification, however, none of this occurred, and the
fulfilment of that intention remained, as we have seen, indefinitely in
suspense. From the viewpoint of legal effectivity, the half-way stage
reached by Nicaragua remained of no account. What effect can after all be
attributed to its recognition as compulsory of a jurisdiction it had not
formally accepted : the jurisdiction of a Court whose Statute it had not
formally recognized ?

In this connection, and even supposing that Nicaragua’s intention was
constant and demonstrable beyond all doubt, I cannot accept the propo-
sition that that intention outweighed the defect because of the formal
character of the latter. As I have indicated at the outset, ratification of the
Protocol was a stringent requirement without whose fulfilment the Per-
manent Court could have no jurisdiction over Nicaragua. This conclusion



is reinforced by the very language of the resolution of 13 December 1920,
which had stated in terms that the Permanent Court was to deal solely with
“disputes between the Members [of the League] or States which have
ratified [the Protocol]” or other States which had been given access to the
Court under the second paragraph of Article 35 of its Statute (P.C.1J.,
Series D, No. 1, 4th ed., p. 7). Nicaragua never fell into either category.
Ratification was thus no matter of pure form, and neither was the require-
ment of “sending” the ratification to the Secretary-General, considering
that the possibility of his notifying “other signatory powers” depended
entirely upon its accomplishment. To my knowledge, he has never been
held remiss for not proceeding to the notification upon the strength of the
1939 telegram.

Certainly, at the time of the Permanent Court, there was no doubt at The
Hague that Nicaragua, until it ratified the Protocol, could not be held
bound by its declaration. The Collection of Texts Governing the Jurisdiction
of the Court issued by the Registrar (P.C.I.J., Series D, No. 6, 4th ed, 1932)
made this perfectly clear with a list of mere “Signataires” of the Optional
Clause (on p. 32) followed immediately by one of “Etats liés” (p. 33).
Several States were placed in the first list, but not in the second ; in most
cases because of a self-imposed requirement of ratification of the decla-
ration that had yet to be fulfilled, but in Nicaragua’s case because it had not
ratified the Protocol (ibid., p. 58, n. 5, and table on p. 61). That situation
never changed throughout the life of the Permanent Court, and so there
was never any moment at which Nicaragua’s declaration could be relied
upon.

Chapter 2. Article 36, paragraph 5, of the Statute

The origin of Article 36, paragraph 5, of the present Court’s Statute may
be traced to a question raised by the United Kingdom at the Washington
Committee of Jurists in the preparations for the San Francisco Conference
in the spring of 1945 to draft the United Nations Charter. In a document
dated 10 April 1945 the United Kingdom drew attention to the matter as
follows :

“One question which will arise in connection with Article 36, is
what action should be taken concerning the existing acceptances of
the ‘optional clause’, by which a number of countries have, subject to
certain reservations, bound themselves to accept the jurisdiction of
the Court as obligatory. Should these acceptances be regarded as
having automatically come to an end or should some provision be
made for continuing them in force with perhaps a provision by which
those concerned could revise or denounce them [?]” (UNCIO, Vol.
XIV, p. 318, emphasis added.)

The documents of the Committee of Jurists do not reveal any significant
discussions on this subject, but in a report of 14 April 1945 the Sub-
Committee dealing with the drafting of Article 36 expressed its belief that
provision should be made for a “special agreement for continuing these
acceptances in force” (in French, “un accord spécial pour maintenir ces
acceptations en vigueur”) (ibid., p. 289). Thus continuance in force was the
theme from the outset.


In Committee IV/1 of the San Francisco Conference, the United King-
dom representative made the following statement on 28 May 1945 :

“If the Committee decides to retain the optional clause, it could
provide for the continuing validity of existing adherences to it. Since
forty Members of the United Nations are bound by it, compulsory
jurisdiction would to this extent be a reality.” (UNCIO, Vol. XIII,
p. 227.)

A Sub-Committee was set up on that day and its report submitted to
Committee IV/1 on 31 May 1945 read as follows :

“The text proposed by the Sub-Committee to the Committee is
attached. This text is the same as that of the first alternative proposed
for Article 36 by the Committee of Jurists of Washington, with the
exception of the two following modifications :



(2) the new paragraph which follows (new paragraph 4) has been
inserted after paragraph 3 :

‘Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Per-
manent Court of International Justice and which are still in force
shall be deemed as between the parties to the present Statute to
have been made under this Article and shall continue to apply, in
accordance with their terms.”” (UNCIO, Vol. XIII, p. 558,
emphasis added.)

The French text of this new paragraph reads :

“Les déclarations encore en vigueur, faites en application de l’article
36 du Statut de la Cour permanente de Justice internationale seront
considérées, en ce qui concerne les rapports réciproques des parties au
présent Statut, comme ayant été faites en application du présent
article, et continueront à s'appliquer conformément aux conditions
qu’elles stipulent.” (Ibid, p. 564, emphasis added.)

In other words, the English and French texts were drafted in exactly the
same manner.

During the debate on this report in Committee IV/1 on 1 June 1945,
several delegates expressed their views on this particular provision.

Canada :

“In view of the new paragraph quoted above, as soon as states sign
the Charter, the great majority of them would be automatically under
the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court because of existing declara-
tions.” (Ibid, p. 248.)

United Kingdom :

“After referring to the fact that his country had accepted the
jurisdiction of the Court for the past sixteen years, he stated that, for
the reasons given in the report, he favoured the compromise suggested
therein. He thought that some forty states would thereby become
automatically subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.”
(Ibid, p. 249.)

Australia :

“[H]e desired to call attention to the fact that not forty but about
twenty states would be automatically bound as a result of the com-
promise. In this connection he pointed out that of the fifty-one states
that have adhered to the optional clause, three had ceased to be
independent states, seventeen were not represented at the Conference
and about ten of the declarations of other states had expired. The
difference between the two systems was therefore much greater than
had been suggested.” (Ibid., p. 266.)



On 5 June 1945 France made a new proposal, suggesting that the
paragraph should read as follows :

“Les déclarations faites en application de l’article 36 du Statut de la
Cour permanente de Justice internationale pour une durée qui n’est pas
encore expirée seront considerées, dans les rapports entre parties au
présent Statut, comme comportant acceptation de la juridiction obliga-
toire de la Cour internationale de Justice pour la durée et dans les
conditions exprimées par ces déclarations.” (UNCIO, Vol. XIII, p. 486,
emphasis added.)

The English text of this suggested amendment reads as follows :

“Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice and which are still in force shall be
deemed, as between the parties to the present Statute, as including
acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Jus-
tice for the time and under the conditions expressed in these declara-
tions.” (Ibid, p. 485, emphasis added.)

It is to be noted, however, that the French amendment was suggested so
as to replace the latter part of the new paragraph as proposed by the
Sub-Committee D, in both the English and French texts, but to change the
wording of the first part only in the French text by replacing “encore en
vigueur” with “pour une durée qui n’est pas encore expirée”. The French
representative stated that “the changes suggested by him in paragraph (4)
were not substantive ones, but were intended to improve the phraseology”
(ibid, p. 284). According to the French version of the report :

“Le représentant de la France déclare que les changements dont il a
proposé l’introduction au paragraphe 4 ne visaient pas le fond mais
tendaient à améliorer la rédaction.” (Zbid., p. 290.)

This statement is crucial to the interpretation of what is now paragraph 5 of
Article 36, for it precludes one from arguing, on the basis of the prepa-
ratory work, that the meaning of the English text may be strained to cover
every subtlety encompassed by its French counterpart.

On 6 June Committee IV/1 unanimously approved paragraph 4, which
was finally drafted as follows :

“Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice and which are still in force shall be
deemed, as between the parties to the present Statute, to be accep-
tances of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of
Justice for the period during which they still have to run and in
accordance with their terms.” (Ibid, p. 284.)

In the report of this Committee it was stated as follows :

“A new paragraph 4 was inserted to preserve declarations made



under Article 36 of the old Statute for periods of time which have not
expired, and to make these declarations applicable to the jurisdiction
of the new Court.” (UNCIO, Vol. XIII, p. 391.)

This English text was identical with that of the draft report (p. 314), but its
French equivalent had been recast so as, inter alia, to replace “les décla-
rations formulées ... pour des périodes qui n’ont pas encore expirées”
(p. 348) with “les déclarations non expirées” (p. 426), which, one may point
out in passing, appears closer to “still in force” than either the French text
of the Statute or the English of the report. The only other mention of this
provision in the document is, curiously enough, found in the part devoted
to the Charter, where it is indicated that the new paragraph (and Art. 37 of
the Statute) would safeguard “the progressive development of the judicial
process” (p. 384).

On 9 June this paragraph had been renumbered paragraph 5 (owing to
the insertion of a new paragraph 4 which is irrelevant to this discussion),
and it thus finally became Article 36, paragraph 5, of the Statute.


There is no denying that the founders of the International Court of
Justice in 1945 wanted to carry over to it declarations accepting the
jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice as compul-
sory. This is no licence, however, for interpreting Article 36, paragraph 5,
as attempting to refer to any declaration which, without being effective,
was simply on record at that time as a historical statement. As shown in the
explanation given by the United Kingdom, which took the initiative on this

the Optional Clause


There is no indication as to how Nicaragua understood its own position
in 1945 vis-a-vis the provisions of Article 36 of the Statute of the new
Court. The only things which are clear are, first, that Report No. 16 of the
Permanent Court of International Justice, which covered the period from
15 June 1939 to 31 December 1945, had not then been published ; and,
second, that the only available report was No. 15, which covered the period
15 June 1938 to 15 June 1939, and which was prepared before the 1939
telegram was sent. Thus in 1945 Nicaragua was not in a position to check
its status in the Permanent Court of International Justice from any official
publication. It may be noted that Nicaragua was represented at the
Washington Committee of Jurists by Ambassador Guillermo Sevilla-
Sacasa and at the San Francisco Conference by Mr. Mariano Argüello
Vargas, then Minister for Foreign Affairs. At any rate, Nicaragua cannot
be deemed to have believed in 1945 that it would be bound by the com-
pulsory jurisdiction of the new Court pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 5,
of the new Statute.


Nicaragua further states that its own conduct, and the acquiescence of
the United States as well as of other States since 1945, provided a basis for
the effectiveness of the 1929 Declaration. According to Nicaragua :

“3. Nicaragua has demonstrated by its consistent conduct for 38
years that it has fully consented to the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Court.

4. The United States, by accepting the effectiveness of Nicaragua’s
declaration for 38 years, has waived any objection to the formal defect
in ratification of the Protocol of Signature.” (Nicaragua's Memorial,
paras. 91, 94.)

In order to prove the allegedly consistent conduct by Nicaragua and the
alleged acceptance of the effectiveness of Nicaragua’s Declaration by the
United States, the present Judgment heavily depends on the way in which
Nicaragua is listed in the International Court of Justice Yearbooks. The


484 - MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES (SEP. OP. ODA)

Judgment points out the fact that Nicaragua is included in the “List of
States which have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the Interna-
tional Court of Justice, or which are still bound by their acceptance of the
Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International
Justice” in the first International Court of Justice Yearbook 1946-1947, in
contrast to its exclusion from the list in the last Report of the Permanent
Court of International Justice of “States bound by the [optional] clause”,
and it states :

“It is . .. difficult to escape the conclusion that the basis of this
innovation was to be found in the possibility that a declaration which,
though not of binding character, was still valid, and was so for a
period that had not yet expired, permitted the application of Article
36, paragraph 5, so long as the State in question, by ratifying the
Statute of the International Court of Justice, provided it with the
institutional foundation that it had hitherto lacked. From that
moment on, Nicaragua would have become ‘bound’ by its 1929
Declaration, and could, for practical purposes, appropriately be
included in the same Yearbook list as the States which had been bound
even prior to the coming into force of the post-war Statute.”
(Para. 37.)

Relying on the inclusion of Nicaragua in the “List of States having
recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Jus-
tice, or which are still bound by the acceptance of the Optional Clause of
the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice” in the Inter-
national Court of Justice Yearbooks, the Judgment (para. 37) seems to
overlook, or ignore, the disclaimer which started in the 1956-1957 Year-
book and which reads :

“The inclusion of a declaration made by any State should not be
regarded as an indication of the view entertained by the Registry or, a
fortiori, by the Court, regarding the nature, scope or validity of the
instrument in question.” (P. 207.)

From the Yearbook 1958-1959 to the Yearbook 1964-1965, the beginning of
the above reads : “The inclusion or omission of ...”

Furthermore, the Judgment seems to overlook another fact, namely, that
in the Yearbook 1946-1947 of the International Court of Justice, the
declarations made for the purpose of accepting the compulsory jurisdic-
tion of the Permanent Court by States which had not deposited the ratifi-
cation of the Protocol of Signature, such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt,
Guatemala, Iraq, Liberia and Turkey, were certainly not treated as having
any potential effect under the Statute of the new Court.

The Registrar of the Court, who is requested by the Court to prepare the
Yearbook, is admittedly responsible for the accuracy of the facts described
therein : however, what kind of legal significance can be drawn from a
description in this document is a completely different matter. The Regis-



trar is not responsible for the legal interpretation of or implications to be
drawn from this publication. It falls within the judicial functions of the
Court to give authoritative meaning to such description and not within the
administrative tasks to be discharged by the Registrar.


It is, however, pertinent to examine how the position of Nicaragua has
been dealt with in the International Court of Justice Yearbooks, whose
presentation of the facts concerning acceptance under the Optional
Clause, after remaining fairly similar from Volume 1 (1946-1947) to
Volume 18 (1963-1964), was greatly changed when a complete overhaul of
the structure of the Yearbook was undertaken with Volume 19 (1964-
1965). Since then it has not changed to the present day.

The information which concerns us here has at various times been dealt
with in different chapters of the Yearbook. It will be appropriate to begin
with the mentions in Chapter III, concerning the Court’s jurisdiction. In
this chapter, there was a table concerning Declarations accepting compul-
sory jurisdiction from 1946-1947 to 1949-1950. The table of States accept-
ing compulsory jurisdiction was set out under the headings “State — Date —
Conditions” in the Yearbook 1946-1947, but this was changed to “State —
Date — Duration” in the 1948-1949 volume, then to “State — Date of
Signature — Duration” in that of 1949-1950. In all of the Yearbooks
Nicaragua was listed as follows : “Nicaragua — 24 IX 29 — Uncondition-
ally”, but with a footnote attached in the same manner as to some other
countries (for instance, in the volume of 1946-1947, Australia, Canada,
Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Iran, Luxem-
bourg, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Siam, Union of South Africa,
United Kingdom and Uruguay) (apparently there is an error in that
Sweden was omitted in the 1946-1947 volume). This footnote stated :

“Declaration made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court and deemed to be still in force (Article 36, paragraph 5, of
Statute of the present Court).”

As from the volume of 1950-1951 this table disappeared, and under the
title of “Acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction” there was a listing show-
ing :

“The following States have deposited with the Secretary-General of
the United Nations the declaration recognizing the Court’s jurisdic-
tion as compulsory, or had already accepted the jurisdiction of the

Permanent Court of International Justice as compulsory for a period
that has not yet expired.” (I.C.J. Yearbook 1951-1952, p. 43)

This format continued until the Yearbook 1958-1959, but since the 1959-
1960 volume such reference to the names of States completely disappeared
from Chapter II. Nicaragua was included in the list mentioned above



since the volume of 1950-1951. From the 1956-1957 to the 1958-1959
volumes, the following footnote was added to Nicaragua : “See footnote to
the declaration of this State, Chapter X, second part.”

In the Yearbook 1946-1947 until that of 1963-1964 there was always a
chapter entitled Texts governing the jurisdiction of the Court ; this was
modelled on the practice of the Registry of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, which however had also issued such chapters as
offprints constituting addenda to Series D, No. 6, bearing the same title. In
Chapter X for 1946-1947, the declaration of Nicaragua was listed under the
section : Communications and declarations of States which are still bound by
their adherence to the Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court
of International Justice (p. 207), with a footnote which read :

“According to a telegram dated November 29th, 1939, addressed to
the League of Nations, Nicaragua had ratified the Protocol of Sig-
nature of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice
(December 16th, 1920), and the instrument of ratification was to
follow. Notification concerning the deposit of the said instrument has
not, however, been received in the Registry.”

It should be remembered in passing that the final sentence was rightly
designed not to exclude the possibility that the ratification had, un-
beknown to the Registrar, been deposited where it belonged — in the
archives of the League Secretariat.

From the time of the Yearbook 1947-1948, under the section headed
Acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, only the texts of new
declarations were reproduced. Declarations like those of Nicaragua which
had been printed in the 1946-1947 volume were not reproduced but simply
made the subject of a reference back to that volume. This practice, which in
effect preserved the actuality of the footnote, was continued until the
Yearbook 1955-1956. Since the Yearbook 1956-1957 all the declarations in
force have always been reproduced.

Also in this Chapter X mentioned above, until the Yearbook 1955-1956
there was always a “List of States which have recognized the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice or which are still bound
by their declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice” (Art. 36 of the Statute of the Inter-
national Court of Justice) (I.C.J. Yearbook 1947-1948, p. 133"). The
headings of each column of the table listing these States have been changed
from “States — Date of signature — Conditions — Date of deposit of
ratification” in the Yearbook 1946-1947 to “State — Date of signature —
Conditions — Date of deposit of ratification” in 1947-1948 ; “State — Date
of signature — Conditions — Date of ratification” in 1948-1949 ; “State —
Date of signature — Date of deposit of signature — Conditions” in 1949-
1950 ; and “State — Date of signature — Date of deposit of declarations —

! The title in the 1946-1947 volume was slightly different.



Conditions” in the 1951-1952 volume. This last type remained until the
1955-1956 volume. During this period Nicaragua was listed as “Nicaragua
— 24 IX 29 — (Unconditionally) — blank”. Since the Yearbook 1949-1950,
because of the change of format, Nicaragua was listed as “Nicaragua —
24 IX 29 — 24 IX 29 — (Unconditionally)”.

In the 1955-1956 volume a footnote was attached to the listing of
Nicaragua, which read as follows :

“According to a telegram dated November 29th, 1939, addressed to
the League of Nations, Nicaragua had ratified the Protocol of Sig-
nature of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice
{December 16th, 1920), and the instrument of ratification was to
follow. It does not appear, however, that the instrument of ratification
was ever received by the League of Nations.”

The new final sentence shows clearly that by 1956 the Registrar had made
thorough enquiries and was reasonably satisfied that the possibility left
open by the previous footnote was now unlikely in the extreme. Since the
Yearbook 1956-1957, as previously mentioned, the texts of all the decla-
rations in force were listed under the title Acceptance of the compulsory
Jurisdiction of the Court in pursuance of Article 36 of the Statute, after which
the table was discontinued. A footnote is attached to the declaration itself
of Nicaragua, which is identical to that in the 1955-1956 volume. From the
Yearbook 1961-1962 onwards, the title was changed to Declaration recog-
nizing compulsory jurisdiction, but there was no change to the substance.

There has been a complete change in the format of the Yearbook since
that of 1964-1965. The former Chapter X was replaced by a new Chapter
TV, Texts governing the jurisdiction of the Court, in which Section II, “De-
clarations recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court”, con-
tained the complete texts of the declarations ; the listing of Nicaragua in
that volume was the same as in 1956-1957 and this presentation has
continued until the latest Yearbook 1982-1983.

Thus it can be seen that throughout the Yearbooks, from the very
beginning, a reservation has always been attached to the Declaration of
Nicaragua. In the 1955-1956 volume a footnote was added in respect of
Nicaragua in the list in Chapter X, and in the 1956-1957 volume, where the
list was discontinued and the full text reproduced, the same footnote was
carried over. In addition, in Chapter III of the volumes from 1956-1957 to
1958-1959 which continued the express reference to the names of the
States, Nicaragua was mentioned with a footnote which referred back to
the footnote included in Chapter X.

Is it possible, from the facts as mentioned above, to draw the conclusion
that the Court has made any authoritative interpretation that Nicaragua

wouid be bound by the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court ? I do not



deny that the Registrar or his staff, at the outset of the International Court
of Justice in 1946, might have queried the legal effect of the 1939 telegram
from Nicaragua. Yet, as the differences of opinions between Judges in the
present case show only too well, it would have been most presumptuous of
him to exclude any declaration that might be seen as not having expired. It
was natural and indeed proper for him to continue publishing Nicaragua’s
Declaration with the factual qualification set out in a footnote, rather than
categorically ignoring it. The Registrar was certainly not in a position to
give any authoritative interpretation to the effect of the 1939 telegram ;
and there is no room to interpret the uncertainties in the handling of the
case of Nicaragua in the International Court of Justice Yearbook as giving
any fresh legal significance to the value of Nicaragua's Declaration.

It may be true that such a treatment of Nicaragua’s declaration had not
been contested by any country, but no one can deny that, unless there is
any practical need to scrutinize specific points, little attention is likely to
have been paid by other States to items which were repeated year by year.
The International Court of Justice Yearbook, like other works of reference
produced by reputable institutions, exists for the accurate conveying of
facts, and where the facts it relates suffice in themselves as the basis of legal
conclusions, it is, I repeat, quite inappropriate to attach ultimate legal
authority to the manner of its drafting. Even were that not so, given that a
footnote is the exception rather than the rule, would it not be reasonable to
expect that the Registry’s remarks would do more to alert the informed
reader against the effectiveness of Nicaragua’s declaration than its inclu-
sion would do to suggest its being in force ?


The case concerning the Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23
December 1906 between Honduras and Nicaragua has repeatedly been
referred to by Nicaragua in support of its contention that its acceptance of
the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court was valid. The present Judgment
does not have much to say about the case, yet it states :

“The Court notes that Nicaragua, even if its conduct in the case
concerning the Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23
December 1906 was not unambiguous, did not at any time declare that
it was not bound by its 1929 Declaration.” (Para. 39.)

In another place it states :

“[W hat States believe regarding the legal situation of Nicaragua so
far as the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court is concerned may
emerge from the conclusions drawn by certain governments as



regards the possibility of obliging Nicaragua to appear before the

PART II. EFFECT OF THE SHULTZ LETTER

Chapter 1. New Types of Reservation

If Nicaragua lacks legal standing as an Applicant for the reason that it
has not accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36,
paragraph 2 or 5, of the Statute, the present proceedings, which were
initiated by a unilateral application by Nicaragua, cannot be entertained
on the basis of those provisions. However, it still appears pertinent to
examine whether the United States could be proceeded against in the
present case supposing Nicaragua did have locus standi to bring the United
States to the Court because of the latter's acceptance of the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court.

On 6 April 1984 the United States added in the so-called Shultz letter a
further reservation to those already made in its Declaration of 26 August
1946. The Shultz letter purported to exclude from the jurisdiction of the
Court :



“[Djisputes with any Central American state or arising out of or
related to events in Central America, any of which disputes shall be
settled in such manner as the parties to them may agree.”

In order to see whether or not this reservation was effective, it is pertinent
to look at the history of reservations to the Optional Clause since the time
of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

IT

In drafting the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice,
the Advisory Committee of Jurists in 1920 did not anticipate any reser-
vations being made concerning the compulsory jurisdiction. The Nether-
lands was the first State accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court
(on 6 August 1921) to make a reservation. It was rather a modest one,
which attempted to limit the jurisdiction of the Court to “any future
dispute in regard to which the parties have not agreed to have recourse to
some other means of friendly settlement” (P.C.1.J., Series D, No. 4, 2nd
ed., p. 20). This type of reservation was used in the 1920s by Estonia (1923),
Belgium (1925), Ethiopia (1926), Germany (1927), Spain (1928), Italy
(1929), Latvia (1929), France (1929) and Czechoslovakia (1929).

In order to reply to the question of the legality of making a reservation to
the Optional Clause and to facilitate the acceptance of the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court by as many countries as possible, the General
Assembly of the League of Nations, on 2 October 1924, passed a resolution
concerning Arbitration, Security, and Reduction of Armaments in which it

“[clonsider{ed] that the study of the .. . terms [of Article 36, para-
graph 2] shows them to be sufficiently wide to permit States to adhere
to the Special Protocol opened for signature in virtue of Article 36,
paragraph 2, with the reservations which they regard as indispensable”
(League of Nations Official Journal, Special Supplement No. 21, p. 21,
emphasis added)

and recommended “States to accede at the earliest possible date” to the
Optional Clause. The Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes, which was attached as an annex to that resolution, reads :

“The Signatory States undertake to recognize as compulsory, ipso
facto and without special agreement, the jurisdiction of the Permanent
Court of International Justice in the cases covered by paragraph 2 of
Article 36 of the Statute of the Court, but without prejudice to the right
of any State, when acceding to the special protocol provided for in the
said Article and opened for signature on December 16th, 1920, to
make reservations compatible with the said clause.” (League of Nations
Official Journal, Special Supplement No. 21, p. 22, emphasis added.)



MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES (SEP. OP. ODA)

In 1928 the General Assembly of the League of Nations again passed a
resolution along the lines suggested four years previously :


“Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,
Non-Aggression and Mutual Assistance

(V) RESOLUTION REGARDING THE OPTIONAL CLAUSE OF ARTICLE 36
OF THE STATUTE OF THE PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL
JUSTICE

The Assembly :

Referring to the [1924 resolution] . . . considering that the terms of
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice are sufficiently wide to permit States to adhere
to the special Protocol opened for signature in virtue of that article,
with the reservations which they regard as indispensable, and con-
vinced that it is in the interest of the progress of international justice
that the greatest possible number of States should, to the widest
possible extent, accept as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court,
recommends States to accede to the said Protocol at the earliest
possible date ;

Noting that this recommendation has not so far produced all the
effect that is to be desired ;

Being of opinion that, in order to facilitate effectively the accep-
tance of the clause in question, ir is expedient to diminish the obstacles
which prevent States from committing themselves ;

Being convinced that the efforts now being made through progres-
sive codification to diminish the uncertainties and supply the defi-
ciencies of international law will greatly facilitate the acceptance of
the optional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the Court, and that
meanwhile attention should once more be drawn to the possibility offered
by the terms of that clause to States which do not see their way to accede
to it without qualification, to do so subject to appropriate reservations
limiting the extent of their commitments, both as regards duration and as
regards scope ;

Noting, in this latter connection, that the reservations conceivable
may relate, either generally to certain aspects of any kind of dispute, or
specifically to certain classes or lists of disputes, and these different kinds
of reservation can be legitimately combined ;

Recommends that States which have not yet acceded to the op-
tional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice should, failing accession pure and simple, con-
sider, with due regard to their interests, whether they can accede on
the conditions above indicated ; ...” (League of Nations Official
Journal, Special Supplement No. 64, p. 183, emphasis added.)

Chapter 2. Termination and Modification of the
United States Declaration


The point at issue with regard to the Shultz letter concerns the legal
implications of its purporting to make a new reservation with immediate
effect. The letter states :

“Notwithstanding the terms of the aforesaid [1946] Declaration,
this proviso [i.e., new reservation] shall take effect immediately and
shall remain in force for two years, so as to foster the continuing
regional dispute settlement process which seeks a negotiated solution
to the interrelated political, economic and security problems of Cen-
tral America.” (Emphasis added.)

The “Notwithstanding” constitutes, of course, an allusion to the following
clause in the United States Declaration of 1946 :

“[T]his declaration shail remain in force . . until the expiration of
six months after notice may be given to terminate this declara-
tion.”

It should thus be asked whether the addition of this new reservation on 6



April 1984 effectively exempts the United States from its adherence, given
in 1946, to the Court’s jurisdiction for a dispute unilaterally brought to the
Court by Nicaragua on 9 April 1984.

The United States has implied that the Shultz letter did not purport to
terminate the 1946 Declaration but only to amend it by making a new
reservation. It is pertinent in this respect to examine the problem of the
validity of a declaration of acceptance of the Optional Clause. Relevant
indications concerning these declarations can be found in the Annual
Report in the case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and in
the Yearbook in the case of the International Court of Justice, but the
format of these publications has changed from time to time and is often
inconsistent.


At the time of the Permanent Court of International Justice in parti-
cular, it appears that the Registry did not necessarily have a precise
understanding of how to deal with the Optional Clause. The inconsistency
in dealing with the date of the Optional Clause in the Annual Reports
causes great confusion to the reader ! ; it is extremely difficult to derive a
clear indication of the status of some of the declarations of acceptance of
the Optional Clause from the Annual Reports of the Permanent Court of
International Justice. However, with this reservation, I deem it useful to
proceed with some analysis of these declarations.

! Ratification was not imposed by the terms of the Optional Clause, but in fact some
declarations were made subject to ratification while others (which did not require it)
were nevertheless ratified. In No. 1 of the Annual Reports of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, the table concerning the Optional Clause in Chapter III (p. 138)
had three columns headed “Signatory States — Date of ratification (if any) — Conditions
of acceptance”, while another table in Chapter X (p. 359) was headed simply “Signatory
States — Date of ratification when required”. In No. 2 of the Annual Reports, the table
appeared in Chapter III only, under the headings “States- — Date of signature —
Conditions — Date of deposit of ratification (if any)”. In No. 3, the headings of the
tables in Chapters III and X were identical in that they indicate “States — Date of
signature — Conditions — Date of deposit of ratification (if any)” (pp. 83 and 335). After
No. 4 of the Annual Reports the list in Chapter III disappeared and the format of the
table in Chapter X of No. 3 was retained. However, in Report No. 16 a table in Chapter X
is headed “States — Date of signature — Conditions — Date of deposit of ratification”,
thus omitting “(if any)” from the heading concerning ratification. I assume that what
must have been significant was the date of the deposit of the declaration, no matter
whether ratification was required under the internal procedures of some countries.
When the table indicates the “Date of deposit of ratification” it might have meant the
date of deposit of the declaration itself, whether it was properly ratified under internal
procedures (when required), or was simply deposited, in cases where internal ratifica-
tion was not required.

International Justice, arranged in chronological order of the first decla-

The following observations may be made from the analysis of Table IT.

First, in the early period of the Permanent Court of International Justice
— in other words in the 1920s — most of the States signatory to the Statute
of the Permanent Court of International Justice (some of which did not
deposit the required ratification of the Protocol of Signature) accepted the
Optional Clause. Many of them did so for a fixed period, mostly five
years ; in addition, many renewed the period after the expiration of the
initial period. On the other hand — in particular at the very beginning of the
Permanent Court of International Justice — some declarations did not
specify any period at all for the duration of the declaration.

Secondly, the most remarkable development was in 1929, when Great
Britain introduced a new concept of the immediate terminability of a
declaration. Great Britain accepted compulsory jurisdiction in a declara-
tion which was stated to remain valid after the first ten-year period until
notice of termination was given. The declaration read in part as fol-
lows :

“I accept as compulsory ... the jurisdiction of the Court .. . for
a period of ten years and thereafter until such time as notice may be
given to terminate the acceptance.” (P.C.IJ., Series E, No. 6,
p. 479.)

This example was followed by the then Commonwealth countries, such as
the Union of South Africa (19 September 1929), India (19 September
1929), New Zealand (19 September 1929), Australia (20 September 1929)
and Canada (20 September 1929). In the period of the Permanent Court of
International Justice this precedent was followed by Persia (2 October
1930), Latvia (31 January 1935), and Iraq (22 September 1938).

Thirdly, another new development was seen in 1930 with the action of
Luxembourg in making a declaration for a five-year period which would
automatically be renewed unless à six months’ advance notice was given.
The Declaration of Luxembourg read as follows :

“The present declaration is made for a period of five years. Unless it
is denounced six months before the expiration of that period, it shall



be considered as renewed for a specific period of five years and
similarly thereafter 1.”

+

Some declarations were terminated or amended while they were still
valid. Colombia, which on 6 January 1932 made a declaration without any
reference to duration, made a fresh declaration on 30 October 1937 which
was to continue for a ten-year period, in order to include a new reserva-
tion.

Paraguay, by a decree of 26 April 1938, withdrew the acceptance of
compulsory jurisdiction which had been expressed by its Declaration of
1933 (P.C.1.J., Series E, No. 14, p. 57). On being notified of Paraguay’s
withdrawal by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, some
countries made express reservations as to the effectiveness of such denun-
ciation, which are contained in the publication of the Permanent Court
(P.C.IJ., Series E, No. 15, p. 227).

Bolivia “makes the most formal reservations as to the legal value of the
decree and requests the Secretary-General to communicate these reser-
vations to the States signatories of the Statute and to the Members of the
League of Nations”.

Belgium “in taking note of this denunciation, feels bound to make all
reservations”.

Brazil “cannot accept such declaration without express reservation”.

Sweden “finds itself obliged to formulate every reservation ; in its view it
will be for the Court itself, should occasion arise, to pronounce on the
legal effects of that declaration”.

Czechoslovakia “is of opinion that, in the absence of any provision in the
Statute regarding the denunciation of declarations, the matter is one in
which reference should be made to the general rules of international law
concerning the termination of international undertakings”.
Netherlands “while not opposed to the denunciation, finds itself obliged
to formulate every reservation as regards the right of States to denounce
treaties which do not contain a clause to that effect”.

On 7 September 1939, the United Kingdom, which had, as noted above,
made a declaration on 19 September 1929 for an initial period of ten years
and then until notice of termination would be given, stated in its let-
ter :

“[T]he position to-day shows clearly that the Covenant has, in the

present instance, completely broken down in practice, that the whole
machinery for the preservation of peace has collapsed, and that the
conditions in which His Majesty’s Government accepted the Optional
Clause no longer exist . . .

I am, therefore, directed to notify you that His Majesty’s Govern-
ment, believing themselves to be firmly defending the principles on
which the Covenant was made, will not regard their acceptance of the
Optional Clause as covering disputes arising out of events occurring
during the present hostilities.” (P.C.1.J., Series E, No. 16, p. 339.)

Other Commonwealth nations, such as New Zealand, the Union of South
Africa, Australia, India and Canada, followed this example. Similarly,
France, which on 7 April 1936 had made a declaration for a five-year
period, sent the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on 10 Sep-
tember 1939, a letter which read in part :

“Les conditions dans lesquelles le Gouvernement frangais avait
adhéré à cette clause se trouvent aujourd’hui profondément modi-
fiées. En particulier, depuis que le système de règlement des conflits
internationaux établi par le Pacte de la Société des Nations n’est plus
regardé comme liant uniformément et obligatoirement tous les
Membres de la Société des Nations, la question de la belligérance et
des droits des neutres apparaît sous un aspect entièrement nouveau.

Le Gouvernement français considère donc, comme le Gouverne-
ment britannique, dont le point de vue vous a été exposé d’autre part,
que son acceptation de la clause de l’article 36 du Statut de la Cour
permanente de Justice internationale ne peut plus désormais avoir
d’effet à l’égard des différends relatifs à des événements qui vien-
draient à se produire durant le cours de la présente guerre.” (/bid.,
p. 337.)

These letters were received in the Secretariat of the League of Nations
and transmitted to States parties to the Protocol of Signature and others.
The publication of the Permanent Court of International Justice shows
that some reservations were made (ibid, p. 333). In its reply of 25 Sep-
tember 1939, the Swiss Government made “reservations . . . regarding the
principle which a denunciation effected in such circumstances involves”.
In their letters, Belgium (20 November 1939), Netherlands (30 November
1939), Peru (12 December 1939), Estonia (5 January 1940) and Siam (6
May 1940) reserved their points of view. The Danish Government, on 29
January 1940, also made reservations concerning declarations of the Com-
monwealth nations and France “more particularly as regards their effect in
relation to disputes not immediately connected with the war”. The Nor-
wegian and Swedish Governments, on 15 and 20 December 1939 respec-
tively, made “reservations as to the legal effect of the above acts of
denunciation, more particularly as regards disputes not connected with the
war”. They also drew attention to the



“fact that, in virtue of Article 36 of the Statute and the declarations
relating thereto, it rests with the Court itself to decide questions as to
its own jurisdiction and, should the case arise, to pronounce upon the
validity and, if necessary, the scope of the acts of denunciation re-
ferred to.”

The Brazilian Government, on 7 May 1940 also made reservations as
regards this “unilateral action . . . in so far as concerns all matters relating
to its rights as a neutral in the present war and coming within the juris-
diction of the Court”.

It is interesting to note in this connection that Sweden suggested that,

If Nicaragua were, contrary to my own view, subject to the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice pursuant to Article 36,
paragraph 5, of the Statute, the declaration which Nicaragua made in 1929
without any fixed period of duration should be interpreted, in view of the
past practice as mentioned above, as being terminable at any time. On the
other hand, the United States, whose declaration in 1946 was expressed to
remain in force until the expiration of six months after notice of termi-

nation was given, amended its declaration just a few days before the seisin
of the Court with this case.

Thus the question of reciprocity arises, in a case where for one party the
adherence to the Optional Clause is terminable at any time and the other
party is bound by its own declaration not to terminate for a certain fixed
period. The Optional Clause in effect plays a double role : one, positive in
that it may on occasion enable a unilateral application to succeed, and the
other one negative in that it may sometimes result in a Respondent being
brought to the Court against its actual will. Thus a State, by declaring its
acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, may seek to
acquire locus standi in a case in which the odds are in its favour, but on the
other hand it may, where it feels placed at a disadvantage, try to release
itself from the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court by the termination or
amendment of its declaration.

In view of the fact that the Optional Clause was so drafted to cause each
declarant State to “recognize as compulsory ... the jurisdiction of the
Court . . . [only] in relation to any other State accepting the same obliga-
tion” (Art. 36, para. 2, of the Statute), is it reasonable or equitable to allow
a party which, as a Respondent, is free to escape at any time from the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court to take advantage, as an Applicant,
by imposing upon the other party the burden of inescapability, which it
does not itself bear ! ? The reciprocity of the obligation must exist at the
date of the seisin of the case, and acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction by
the Applicant and the Respondent must be current at that date. I am of the
view that Nicaragua is not in a position to invoke the obligation which it
does not bear and which the United States, as Respondent, has borne
because of its previous declaration. Thus the United States is fully
exempted from the Court’s jurisdiction in relation to Nicaragua on the date
of Nicaragua's Application.

The interpretation of the declaration of acceptance of the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court as I have presented it above may be criticized as an
attempt to-nullify-the-original intention of the Optional ClauseSuch
criticism I would answer as follows : this clause was first proposed at the
beginning of the Permanent Court of International Justice shortly after the
termination of the First World War, following failure to actualize the
idealistic view that, as in a national domestic society, a court should be

which had been an adherent to the Optional Clause, to prevent a non-declarant State
from suddenly taking advantage as an Applicant of the immediate acceptance of the
Optional Clause. This declaration of 14 September 1959 excluded a case in which “the
acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction on behalf of a party to the dispute was
deposited or ratified less than twelve months prior to the filing of the application
bringing the dispute before the Court” (I.C.J. Yearbook 1959-1960, p. 242). This for-
mula was followed by Somalia (25 March 1963), Malta (29 November 1966), Mauritius
(4 September 1968) and the United Kingdom (1 January 1969).



provided with full jurisdiction over any dispute in the international com-
munity. The drafters of the Statute of the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice might have thought that this Optional Clause would be a first
step towards the final goal that the International Court should be given full
jurisdiction over disputes. This same idea concerning the Optional Clause
was also prevalent when the new Statute of the International Court of
Justice was being prepared at the San Francisco Conference in 1945
against the background of regret for the “untold sorrow to mankind”
brought by the “scourge of war” (see the Preamble to the United Nations
Charter).

The rule of law should prevail in the international community as in
modern domestic society, while the supremacy of the courts is always to be
maintained. Yet the reality of the international community — where a lack
of confidence in international law still prevails and the law-enforcement
machinery is still non-existent — had not reached a stage that could satisfy
the dreams of the idealists in either the early 1920s or the mid-1940s.

I note that, in contrast to the period of the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice, when a great majority of the States parties were subject to
the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under the Optional Clause, the
present situation in the 1980s is that adherence to the compulsory juris-
diction of the Court has been declared by less than one-third of the parties
to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In spite of the appeal
made by the United Nations in 1974 in General Assembly resolution 3232
(XXIX) concerning the review of the role of the International Court of
Justice, which read in part :

“[The General Assembly] [rlecognizes the desirability that States
study the possibility of accepting, with as few reservations as possible,
the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in
accordance with Article 36 of its Statute”,

only two States, Togo and Barbados, have adhered to the Optional Clause
in the past decade.

Itis a striking fact that those States which at present in their declarations
impose upon themselves the obligation not to escape from the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court in the face of the possibility of being brought
before the Court, are extremely limited in number — three countries in the
western hemisphere, Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States, and seven
Western European countries, Denmark, Finland, Liechtenstein, Luxem-
bourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In
addition, the Optional Clause, which was drawn up in 1920 without fore-
seeing any reservations, is now encumbered by the great variety of reser-
vations attached to it.

The Court should not close its eyes to the practice and experience over
the last 40 years in the international community, which has given a new
meaning to the Optional Clause. The basic principle that the jurisdiction of



any judicial institution in the international community is based upon the
consent of sovereign States has never been changed, and the role of the
Optional Clause can never override that principle. In spite of this, the
Optional Clause would certainly remain useful in the event that any bona
fide parties to a dispute, though not willing to initiate proceedings by
concluding a special agreement, may not object to coming before the Court
if the other party is willing to do so. On the other hand, I am sure that the
interpretation of the Optional Clause given by the present Judgment will
inevitably induce declarant States to terminate their declarations or at least
drop from them any advance notice clause, so as to avoid having to answer
any case unilaterally brought by other States, which themselves can take
advantage of withdrawing at any time from their obligations under the
Court’s jurisdiction. This would thus vastly diminish the importance of the
Optional Clause. =

CONCLUSIONS

Thus the conclusions I have reached are as follows : first, there is no
ground for assuming that Nicaragua, to which Article 36, paragraph 5, of
the Statute cannot apply, can be held to have locus standi in the present
proceedings on the basis of acceptance of the Optional Clause ; secondly,
assuming arguendo that Nicaragua has /ocus standi in the present proceed-
ings, the Application cannot be entertained under the Optional Clause,
because the United States excluded, before the seisin of the case, the type
of dispute at issue from its obligation under that clause in its relation to
Nicaragua ; hence Nicaragua cannot invoke the fixed duration of the
United States obligation to the Court’s jurisdiction.

I regret that I have had no time to discuss the so-called Vandenberg
reservation, but even without invoking it the United States, for the reasons

I have stated above, cannot, in my view, be subjected to the Court’s
jurisdiction under the Optional Clause for this particular case.
