The central issue in this case is, in my opinion, whether the
dispute alleged by the Republic of Cameroon is a dispute within
the meaning of the adjudication clause; Article 19 of the Trustee-
ship Agreement. Since I reach the conclusion that the dispute
alleged is not a dispute within the meaning of that Article, the
Court is, in my opinion, without jurisdiction.

This Court in 1962 had occasion in the South West Africa cases!
to consider an adjudication clause which was contained in the
Mandate Instruments under the Covenant of the League of Nations,
a clause which in all essentials—apart from one matter to which
reference will later be made—was the same as that set out in
Article 10 of the Trusteeship Agreement the subject of consideration
in this case. The very core of the Court’s reasoning which led it to
give to the adjudication clause in the South West African Mandate
the all-embracive interpretation it did was, in my view, that that
clause was inherently necessary, was essential to the unctioning of
the Mandate System and the exercise of the Mandate, in order to
ensure the performance by the Mandatory Power of its obligations
to the peoples of the Mandated Territory as set forth in the Mandate
Instrument. The clause, in the Court’s opinion, thus provided an
essential judicial security for the performance of these obligations.
These considerations led the Court to conclude that the adjudi-
cation clause in the Mandate Instrument covered not only disputes
between a State, a Member of the League, and the Mandatory
Power in relation to provisions of the Mandate Instrument where-
under individual rights or interests were conferred upon States,
Members of the League or their nationals, but also the provisions
thereof which imposed general obligations upon the Mandatory
Power in the interests of the people of the Mandated Territory—
the obligations to carry out the “sacred trust” imposed upon and
undertaken by it.

In the present case the context of the adjudication clause—Article
19 of the Trusteeship Agreement—is not the same as it was in the
South West Africa cases, though it is in all essential wording the
same. In the South West Africa cases the clause had to be interpreted
in the context of the Covenant of the League and the terms of the
Mandate Instrument ; in the present case it must be interpreted in

1 I.C.J]. Reports 1962, p. 319.


the context of the International Trusteeship System established
under the Charter of the United Nations and the terms of the
Trusteeship Agreement itself. Moreover, much of the foundation
upon which the Court erected its reasoning in the cases of South
West Africa in the instant case crumbles away; the Court in those
cases itself recognizing that the necessity for the adjudication
clause—essentiality—which was stated by it to characterize the
clause in the Mandate System disappeared under the International
Trusteeship System of the United Nations; it was “dispensed with”
by the terms of the Charter 1.

My colleague, Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, and I disagreed
with the reasoning of the Court as well as with the interpretation it
placed upon the adjudication clause in the Mandate Instruments,
and we expressed our view at length. Although a great deal of what
we then had to say is directly applicable to the interpretation to be
accorded to the adjudication clause in this case—in particular we
rejected the view that the adjudication clause was either essential or
necessary to the Mandate System or the Mandate Instrument—
none the less, since the task of interpretation in this case is not the
same as that which faced the Court in the South West Africa cases,
it would, I think, be neither sufficient nor satisfactory to refer in
general to the reasoning then advanced by my colleague and myself
and content myself with a brief presentation of my views in the
case, I think it advisable to express in some detail the reasons which
lead me, in this case, to the conclusion that the dispute alleged by
the Applicant is not a dispute within the meaning of Article 19
of the Trusteeship Agreement before the Court.

The Applicant alleges breaches by the Respondent of Articles 3,
5, 6 and 7 of the Trusteeship Agreement. The breaches alleged are
not particularized except under heads of “complaints” in the
Application and Memorial. The Articles above mentioned express in
broad and general terms obligations undertaken by the Adminis-
tering Authority with the United Nations to administer the Terri-
tory in such a manner as to achieve the basic objectives of the
International Trusteeship System laid down in Article 76 of the
United Nations Charter (and to this end the Administering Author-
ity undertook to collaborate fully with the General Assembly and
the Trusteeship Council on the discharge of their functions) (Article
3): to promote the development of free political institutions suited
to the Territory and assure its inhabitants an increasing share in

* I.C.J. Reports 1962, at 342.


administrative and other services and develop their participation
in government as might be appropriate to the particular circum-
stances of the Territory and its people, special regard being had to
the provisions of Article 5 (a) of the Trusteeship Agreement (Article
6): and to apply in the Territory, inter alia, recommendations
already existing or thereafter drawn up by the United Nations which
might be appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Terri-
tory and conduce to the achievement of the basic objectives of the
International Trusteeship System (Article 7). Article 5 (2), to which
reference is made above, provided that for all purposes of the
Trusteeship Agreement the Administering Authority should have
full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction and should
administer the Territory in accordance with the Authority's own
laws as an integral part of its territory “with such modification as
may be required by local conditions” and subject to the provisions
of the United Nations Charter and of the Trusteeship Agreement.

Though the Applicant alleges breaches generally of the provisions
of the Trusteeship Agreement no other specific provision of the same
is adverted to by the Applicant or referred to in its “complaints”,
which constitute, as its Application states, the subject-matter of its
dispute with the Respondent Government, other than Article 5
(6) which provides that the Administering Authority should be
entitled, znter alia, to constitute the Territory into an administrative
union or federation with adjacent territories under its sovereignty
or control and to establish common services between such territories
and the Trust Territory where such “measures” were not inconsistent
with the basic objectives of the International Trusteeship System
or with the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement.

The gist of the complaints of the Applicant Government may be
stated as follows: the objective of development of free political
institutions, etc., has not been achieved; this it is alleged was a
breach of Article 3 of the Agreement: the Northern Cameroons had
been administered as an integral part of Nigeria and not as a
distinct territory; this is alleged to have been a breach of Article 5
(b) of the Agreement: the Trust Territory had been administered
in two separate parts, the Southern and Northern Cameroons with
two administration systems and following, it is asserted, separate
courses of political development ; this is alleged to be contrary to a
“rule of unity” presumably inherent in the Trusteeship Agreement.
These breaches are further alleged to have continued from 1946
onwards and are stated to have deployed their effects in a continuous
manner up to the time of the plebiscite held in the Northern
Cameroons in February 1961 preventing consultation with the
people sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Trusteeship
Agreement, as a result of which plebiscite the Trusteeship Agree-
ment was brought to an end before the objectives of Article 76 of
the Charter had been achieved. Thus, it is said, Northern Cameroons
became part of the State of Nigeria.

In the South West Africa cases the view of the Court that Article 7
of the Mandate Instrument was inherently necessary or essential to
the functioning of the Mandate System, giving effect to the concept
of what has been termed the “judicial protection of the sacred
trust”, was of the very heart of the Court’s reasoning. This view
found its first expression in the Judgment when the Court was
dealing, not with the question of what was a dispute within the
meaning of Article 7 of the Mandate, but with the question raised by
the Second Objection of the Union of South Africa which centred on
the term “another Member of the League of Nations...” in that
Article. The Union of South Africa had claimed that Ethiopia and
Liberia did not have the status required by the Article to invoke the
jurisdiction of the Court since neither was any longer a Member of
the League of Nations. The Court, after stating that this contention
was claimed to be based upon the natural and ordinary meaning of
the words “another Member of the League of Nations”, did not, as
I understand the Judgment, deny that the natural and ordinary
meaning of the words were as contended for by the Union of South
Africa. It stated that the rule of interpretation that recourse should

1 See in particular Articles 3 and 7 of the Trusteeship Agreement.




be had, in the first place, at least, to the ordinary and natural
meaning of words was not an absolute rule of interpretation and
then proceeded to observe that—

“Where such a method of interpretation results in a meaning
incompatible with the spirit, purpose and context of the clause or
instrument in which the words are contained, no reliance can be
validly placed on it” (I.C.J. Reports 1962, at 336).

The Court then proceeded to state its reasons why reliance, in the
light of this observation, could not be placed upon the natural and
ordinary meaning of the words in question. The centre of its reasons
was the assertion that “judicial protection of the sacred trust in
each Mandate was an essential feature of the Mandates System”;
the administrative supervision by the League was “a normal
security” to ensure full performance by the Mandatory of the
“sacred trust” but “the specially assigned role of the Court was
even more essentiall, since it was to serve as the final bulwark of
protection by recourse to the Court against possible abuse or
breaches of the Mandate” 2; for without this additional security,
the Court went on to say, the supervision by the League and its
Members could not be effective in the last resort since supervision
by the League Council was subject to the rule of unanimity of its
Members, including the approval of the Mandatory itself. In the
event of a conflict between the Mandatory and other Members of
the Council, in the last resort, the Court continued, “the only course
left to defend the interests of the inhabitants! in order to protect the
sacred trust would be to obtain an adjudication by the Court…”.
This, it said, could only be achieved by a State a Member of the
League invoking the adjudication clause in the Mandate Instrument.

“It was for this all-important purpose’ that the provision was
couched in broad terms embracing ‘any dispute whatever’ 1... It is
thus seen what an essential part! Article 7 was intended to play as
one of the securities in the Mandates System for the observance of
the obligations by the Mandatory...” (I.C.J. Reports 1962, at 337.)

Moreover, the Court added, this ‘“essentiality of judicial pro-
tection for the sacred trust”, the right to implead the Mandatory
before the Permanent Court, was “specially and expressly” con-
ferred upon the Members of the League “evidently also because it
was the most reliable procedure of ensuring protection by the Court,
whatever might happen to or arise from the machinery of adminis-
trative supervision” 3.

There was, the Court said, an “important difference” in the
structure and working of the system of supervision of mandated

territories under the League and that of trust territories under the
United Nations, namely that the unanimity rule in the Council of
the League had under the Charter been displaced by the rule of a
two-thirds majority. This observation of the Court was directed to
meet an argument that Article 7 was not an essential provision of
the Mandate Instrument for the protection of the sacred trust of
civilization, in support of which argument attention had been
called to the fact that three of the four “C” Mandates when brought
under the trusteeship provisions of the Charter of the United
Nations did not contain, in the respective trusteeship agreements,
any adjudication clause. It was in the course of dealing with this
argument that a statement of the Court, greatly relied upon by the
Respondent in this case to distinguish the present case from that
of South West Africa, was made. The Court’s statement was as
follows:

“Thus legally valid decisions can be taken by the General As-
sembly of the United Nations and the Trusteeship Council under
Chapter XITI of the Charter without the concurrence of the trustee
State and the mecessity ! for invoking the Permanent Court for
judicial protection which prevailed under the Mandates System is
dispensed with under the Charter +”?

In the Dissenting Opinion of myself and Judge Sir Gerald Fitz-
maurice in those cases there appear the reasons why we were
unable to agree with this reasoning of the Court, and there is no
need to repeat them here. It is sufficient for the moment to note the
reasoning of the Court and to observe that it was directed to
establishing that in the events which happened there arose out of a
debate in the Assembly of the League, on the eve of its dissolu-
tion, a unanimous agreement among all Member States that the
Mandate should be continued to be exercised after the dissolution
of the League of Nations in accordance with the obligations defined
in the Mandate Instrument, including that of the Mandatory under
the adjudication clause; that this specific obligation survived and
necessarily involved reading into the clause the words ‘Members of
the United Nations” in place of the words “Members of the League
of Nations”.

It is evident that the view of the Court was—and with this I am
in full accord—that in a trusteeship agreement under the provisions
of the Charter of the United Nations an adjudication clause is not
inherently necessary or essential to secure the observance of the
general obligations of the Administering Authority undertaken by
it in the interests of the inhabitants.

When later in its Judgment the Court turned to the examination

before the Court was not a dispute as envisaged in Article 7 of the
Mandate, again the thesis of “essentiality” of the adjudication
clause in the Mandate Instrument was to the fore of the Court’s
approach; it was indeed of its essence. Having already asserted and
developed the thesis earlier in its Judgment, it returned to and
reasserted it. The adjudication clause in the Mandate Instrument
was ‘“‘clearly in the nature of implementing one of the ‘securities! for
the performance of this trust’, mentioned in Article 22, paragraph 1”
of the Covenant of the League.

“The right to take legal action conferred by Article 7 … is an
essential ! part of the Mandate itself and inseparable from its exer-
cise 1... While Article 6 of the Mandate ... provides for administrative
supervision by the League, Article 7 in effect provides, with the
express agreement of the Mandatory, for judicial protection! by
the Permanent Court by vesting the right of invoking the compul-
sory jurisdiction against the Mandatory for the same purpose 1... 2"

Taking the view the Court did throughout its Judgment of the
purpose and function of the adjudication clause—of its inherent
necessity, of its essentiality, as part of the Mandate System, and
its inseparability from the exercise of the Mandate itself, it is
understandable, perhaps inevitable, that in interpreting the
adjudication clause in the Mandate Instrument it gave to it the
wide and all-embracive interpretation it did. There can, I think, be
no doubt whatever that the Court’s thesis of the purpose the clause
was intended to serve completely controlled its interpretation
thereof. To the rest of the Article the Court applied, it said, the rule
of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words which rule it had
found reasons to disregard when dealing with the Second Objection.
The words upon which the emphasis was laid in interpreting the
rest of the adjudication clause in the Mandate Instrument were the
same words which appear in the adjudication clause with which we
are presently concerned, namely ‘“‘any dispute whatever” and
“relating to the interpretation or the application of the provisions
of” the Mandate Instrument.

It is important to quote what the Court said in full 3. It said:

“The language used is broad, clear and precise: it gives rise to
no ambiguity and it permits of no exception. It refers to any
dispute whatever relating not to any one particular provision or
provisions, but to ‘the provisions’ of the Mandate, obviously meaning
all or any provisions, whether they relate to substantive obligations
of the Mandatory toward the inhabitants of the Territory or toward
the other Members of the League or to its obligation to submit to
supervision by the League under Article 6 or to protection under

1 Emphasis added.

Article 7 itself. For the manifest! scope and purport of the pro-
visions of this Article indicate that the Members of the League
were understood * to have a legal right or interest ! in the observance
by the Mandatory of its obligations both toward the inhabitants
of the Mandated Territory, and toward the League of Nations
and its Members.”

It is upon this pronouncement of the Court that the Applicant
rests its contention that the dispute in this case is one which comes
within the content of Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement.

In the Joint Dissenting Opinion of Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice
and myself we gave our reasons, with the great respect which is due
to the Court, not only for thinking that the Court had erred in its
thesis of “‘essentiality”’, “inherent necessity” and “inseparability”,
but also why we thought, read in their context, the words of
Article 7 of the Mandate Instrument revealed an ambiguity which
precluded that Article being interpreted in the manner the Court
did. However, whether the Court was or was not right in the
interpretation which it accorded Article 7 of the Mandate Instru-
ment, it is, I think, abundantly evident that that interpretation
cannot automatically be applied to the adjudication clause in the
present case. The thesis of “essentiality”, etc., can find no place in
this case. Moreover the context in which Article 10 of the Trustee-
ship Agreement must be interpreted is different to the context in
which Article 7 of the Mandate had to be interpreted.

However the reasoning of the Court in the South West Africa cases
is looked at, the interpretation it accorded the adjudication clause
in that case has, I believe, little judicial authority in the deter-
mination of the meaning of Article 19 in this case.

*
* *

None the less that interpretation is now sought to be applied—lifted
and transposed—to the adjudication clause in the present case;
the words of Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement being the same
in all essentials as the adjudication clause in the Mandate Instru-
ments the language of which was said by the Court to be “broad,
clear and precise” and permitting of “no exception”, the same inter-
pretation it is contended, must be applied to Article 19.

This line of reasoning is inadmissible. What is necessary to be
done is to interpret Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement 27 ifs
context and in the light of the surrounding circumstances at the time

the Agreement was entered into. The Applicant hardly directed
itself to this task but relied, in the main, upon the Court’s view in
the South West Africa cases that the adjudication clause admitted
of no exception, thus it extended to cover the invocation of the
Court’s jurisdiction not only in the interests of the inhabitants,
which was a central consideration in the Court thesis in the South
West Africa cases, but also in the interests of a State itself, as the
Applicant is asserting a right to do in the present case.

It will be my task to examine Article 19, not merely as a clause
containing certain words, but in its context and surrounding
circumstances in order to ascertain the intention of the two Parties
to the Trusteeship Agreement—the United Nations and the Re-
spondent—in relation to that Article, and to demonstrate that
the Applicant’s contention is ill founded.

Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement

Article 19 reads as follows:

“If any dispute whatever should arise between the Administering
Authority and another Member of the United Nations relating to
the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agree-
ment, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negotiation or other
means, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice
provided for in Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter.”

General Assembly or any conduct on its part vis-a-vis the Ad-
ministering Authority in relation to the carrying out of the pro-
visions of the Trusteeship Agreement.

It becomes therefore necessary to interpret Article 19 of the
Trusteeship Agreement in order to ascertain what meaning is to be
accorded the words “any dispute whatever ... relating to ... the
provisions of this Agreement”, etc., and in particular to ascertain
whether the dispute alleged by the Applicant is one which falls with-
in the ambit of this Article.

The Context in which Article 19 Must Be Interpreted

It is not possible to interpret Article IQ as if it were a separate
instrument, comparable, for example, to a declaration of a State
accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article
36 (2) of the Statute of the Court, vet this, in my opinion, is pre-
cisely what is attempted to be done in the present case. What may
appear clear in such an exercise may become very unclear when
an adjudication clause is read in its context.

The context in which Article 1g must be read is the Trusteeship
Agreement of which it forms part, and the International Trustee-
ship System established by Chapter XIII of the Charter of the
United Nations of which the Trusteeship Agreement is part and
with which its provisions are interwoven. Moreover the provisions
of Chapter XIII of the Charter and the international system which
it established form the background and part of the surrounding
circumstances in which the Trusteeship Agreement was entered
into, without an appreciation of which it is, in my view, quite
impossible to ascertain the intention of the Parties to the Trustee-
ship Agreement in relation to Article 19.

It is convenient first to consider the provisions of Chapter XIII
of the Charter particularly since the Trusteeship Agreement in-
corporates and refers to such provisions, and contains, as do all
trusteeship agreements, an obligation on the part of the administer-
ing authority, which is indeed the dominant obligation to be found
in the Trusteeship Agreement, so to administer the territory as to
achieve the objectives of Article 76 of the Charter.



Trusteeship System—Chapter XIII of the Charter

When the trusteeship was negotiated and entered into the
League of Nations had come to an end. A new organization had
been set up: the United Nations. To carry out the purposes of its
Charter there were established six principal organs, three of which
were the General Assembly, the Trusteeship Council and this Court.
The Charter called for the establishment of an international trustee-
ship system for the administration and supervision of such terri-
tories as might be placed thereunder by voluntary agreement.
“The functions of the United Nations with regard to trusteeship
agreements’ —except such as might relate to strategic areas—
including their approval, were exercisable by the General Assembly

operating under the authority of the General Assembly was charged
with the duty of assisting the General Assembly in carrying out the
functions of the United Nations, including that of the supervision
of the administration of the Trust Territory. It was (so to speak) the
organ established to police the execution of the provisions of the
Trusteeship Agreement to ensure that the basic objectives of the
Trusteeship System in respect of each Trusteeship Agreement were
achieved, reporting from time to time direct to the General Assem-
bly on the discharge of its duties.

The conclusion must be that the Charter contemplated that these
two principal organs—the General Assembly and the Trusteeship
Council—and only these two organs should police the execution
and carrying out of the objectives of the International Trusteeship
System and of the provisions in any Trusteeship Agreement
directed to this end, and by their supervision of the administration
of territories by the Administering Authorities and of the obligations
undertaken by them in Trusteeship Agreements, by questionnaires
formulated by the Trusteeship Council on the political, economic,
social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of each
Trust Territory within the competence of the General Assembly (to
which questionnaires the Administering Authorities were bound to
respond), by scrutinising the answers thereto, by considering the
reports submitted by Administering Authorities, by accepting
petitions, by periodic visits to the Trust Territories and by other
action taken in conformity with the terms of Trusteeship Agree-
ments, to ensure that the obligations of each Administering Au-
thority in relation to the achievement of the basic objectives of the
Trusteeship System were being fulfilled.

It must have been evident, even to those unacquainted with the
difficulties of administering Trust Territories, that problems of
administration and differences of opinion in relation thereto would,

1 Article 85 of the Charter.


at times, inevitably occur between the United Nations and the
Administering Authorities or, at least, would be likely to occur, and
that, whatever they were, they were to be resolved, so far at least
as the Charter contemplated, through the machinery of the Trustee-
ship Council and the General Assembly and in no other way.

Trusteeship Agreements for all areas not designated as strategic
areas, the supervision of the administration of the Trust Territories,
the policing of the obligations owed both to the United Nations
itself and the peoples of the territory, as set forth in the provisions
of any Trusteeship Agreement to be entered into, were vested
exclusively in the General Assembly. Though an organ of the
United Nations, no function in relation to administration or
supervision or the enforcement of any obligation undertaken by the
Administering Authority or any judicial protection of the interests
of the inhabitants was assigned to the Court by Chapter XIII.

By provisions to be found elsewhere in the Charter?, the General
Assembly or the Trusteeship Council could, if it thought fit, seek
an advisory opinion of the Court. It was not bound to do so and,
if it did, it was not bound thereby; all the functions of the United
Nations in relation to Trusteeship Agreements entered into by it
were for the General Assembly and it alone to exercise. Whether an
advisory opinion was sought or not in no way affected the plenary
powers of the Assembly to exercise, in relation to any Trusteeship
Agreement, all the functions of the United Nations.

It is now necessary to consider the provisions of Article 76 of the
Charter the achievement of the objectives of which the Adminis-
tering Authority in the instant case undertook by Article 3 of the
Trusteeship Agreement. The central provision of this Article in
the context of present consideration is sub-clause (b) thereof, which
provides that one basic objective of the International Trusteeship
System was—

“to promote the political, economic, social and educational ad-
vancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their
progressive development towards self-government or independence

1 Article 96 of the Charter.


as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each
territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the
peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each
trusteeship agreement’.

The Applicant complains, as has been noticed, that one of the
obligations which the Administering Authority failed to discharge
was that contained in Article 3 of the Trusteeship Agreement. If
Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement gives a right to a State to
invoke the jurisdiction of the Court on the interpretation of or

The obligation of the Administering Authority to achieve the
objective set out in Article 76 (5) of the Charter involves consider-
ations which, on their face, are peculiarly for political appreciation,
and these, so far as the Charter contemplated, were, as has been
observed, for the General Assembly, with the assistance of the
Trusteeship Council, to evaluate. It is not readily apparent what
legal norms could be applied to determine whether or not the
Administering Authority had breached Article 3 of the Trusteeship
Agreement; what legal norms, for example, could be applied by
the Court at any given point of time during the currency of the
Trusteeship Agreement and in a variety of circumstances to a situ-
ation in which it was alleged by a State invoking the provisions of
the adjudication clause that the Administering Authority had
failed “to promote the political ... advancement of the inhabitants

. as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each
territory”. The words of Article 76 (b) have a special political
content; they appear to call for political evaluation and deter-
mination only. Certainly it is apparent that, so far as the Charter
contemplated, it was a matter exclusively for political evaluation
by an organ, which, both by its composition and the machinery
provided by the Charter, was equipped to discharge that task. Yet
if the Applicant’s contention in this case were correct, the Court was
intended by the adjudication clause, at the instance of any State,
a Member of the United Nations, to pronounce upon these very
matters, and to do so irrespective of any determination made in
respect thereof by the General Assembly itself or any view which
it held or might hold.

As was said in the Joint Opinion in the South West Africa cases
when referring to the words contained in the Mandate Instrument
(Article 2 thereof), under which the Mandatory Power undertook
“to promote to its utmost the material and moral well-being and the
social progress of the inhabitants... ’’, there is hardly a term in
Article 76 (b) of the Charter “which could not be applied in widely
different ways to the same situation or set of facts, according to
different subjective views as to what it meant, or ought to mean...



They involve questions of appreciation rather than of objective
determination” such as a legal determination necessarily involves.
“The proper forum for the appreciation and application of a
provision of this kind is unquestionably a technical or political one,
such as … the Trusteeship Council and the Assembly of the United
Nations !.”’ There can be no doubt that the General Assembly and
the Trusteeship Council constituted the forum exclusively contem-
plated by the Charter for the determination of the matters referred
to in Article 76 (5) of the Charter. What was said in the Joint
Opinion applies with equal force to the consideration of Article 3
of the Trusteeship Agreement and, as will subsequently appear, to
other Articles thereof, the breach of which is complained of by the
Applicant.
