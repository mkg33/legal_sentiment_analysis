   2. Since, however (or therefore), 1 believe that the Court has gone
seriously astray in deciding how this case should be handled at this
preliminary objections phase, 1 must explain why.
   3. ln this case, the Federal Republic of Germany, the respondent
State, has lodged with the Court no less than six preliminary objections
to the Application brought against it by the Principality of Liechtenstein,
as applicant State. Three of these objections are stated to go ta the juris-
diction of the Court ta hear Liechtenstein's Application, and the second
set of three are c1aimed to be reasons why the Court, assuming it holds
itself to have jurisdiction, should nevertheless dec1are Liechtenstein's
daims inadmissible. No doubt this is not in itself a matter for judicial
comment. Litigating States are free to argue their case before the Court
as they think best; that is regarded as one of their sovereign attributes, in
which the Court should not in normal circumstances interfere.

  4. It remains truc ail the same that Lîechtenstein's daim against Ger-
many, though undoubtedly an unusual one, a daim without obvious
precedent, a daim which depends upon creative legal reasoning, is none-
theless in its essence a simple daim, without multifarious strands or com-
plexities. Liechtenstein asserts that the present-day German State has,
throughout its lifetime, owed certain duties 10 Liechtenstein, as a recog-
nized neutral in the Second World War, that those duties have been
breached by certain specified conduct in recent years, and that the breach
gives rise accordingly to the conseq uences provided for in the law of State
responsibility. Even allowing for an understandable degree of forensic
reinsurance, the interposition of a barricade of three jurisdictional plus
three "admissibility" objections against sa simple a daim creates the
impression of indignation, not to say outrage, that the c1aim should have
been brought in the first place. As indicated, however, this may not be fit
matter for judicial comment - except (in the context of the present
opinion) ta the extent that the phenomenon unites with certain features
of the case to which [ will return below.







    5. Tt is not necessary for me ta say anything of my own about the first
 preliminary objection, the so-ca!led absence of a dispute between the
 Parties. On it, l am in complete agreement with the Court. The objection
 has little merit. Germany had itself recognized, in a formai bilateral con-
text, that there was a dispute between the two States which might have ta
be settled by judicial means. Tndeed, given this recognition (1 would be
disinclined to caH it an admission, as it amounted to nothing more than
a reflection of the objective facts), 1 would be prepared ta go further than
the Court, and to hold that Gennany was precluded, by ordinary con-
siderations of good faith, from now raising an objection of" no dis pute".
    6. The issues on which 1 part company substantia!ly from the Court
relate rather ta the second preliminary objection, that under which Ger-
many claims that the dispute between the Parties falls outside Germany's
acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court by virtue of the exception
ra/ione temporis contained in Article 27 (a) of the European Convention
 for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. There is no need for me ta repeat
the opposing contentions of the Parties on this question, or the prior
j uri sprudence of the Court on questions of th is ki od; on bath aspects, T
have no quarre! with the summary given in the Court's Judgment. 1 need
only remark that, in my view, the prior jurisprudence of this Court and
its predecessor, difficult as sorne aspects of it are to reconcile, at least
establishes that, in interpreting clauses of this kind, the Court enjoys a
certain latitude or discretion in determining what facts or situations
should be regarded as what the Court now refers ta as the "source or real
cause" of a dispute before it - if only because no one international dis-
pute exactly resembles another in the way in which it cornes into exist-
ence. The Court diseusses (in paragraph 43 of the Judgment) the fact that
the limitation ratione temporis re!ied upon in the present case is con-
 tained in an agrecd trcaty instrument on the peaccful settlement of dis-
putes, not in a unilateral acceptance under the optional clause, and
decides that nothing material turns on that fact. With that conclusion 1
 have no great difficulty, at least in the particular circumstances of this
case, though 1 would not exclude the possibility of a different answer
 being appropriate in other circumstances. In the present case, at ail
events, each Party, in its pleadings, has half-expressly, half-implicitly
accepted the re!evance of the three cases primarily in question (Phos-
phates in Morocco, Elec/ricity Company of Sofia and Bulgoria, and Right
of Passage), and the Court is entitled ta treat that as an agreed under-
 standing between these two Contracting States as to the extent of their
treaty obligation towards one another, and give weight ta il accordingly
 under normal Vienna Convention principles.

   7. More to the purpose is however the faet that the Court, in reaching
its conclusion (a somewhat discretionary conclusion, as 1 indicate above)
that the essential facts or situations to which the present dispute "relates"
are anterior to the critical date of 1980 under the European Convention,
bases itself on the argument that the German courts, in their decision not



to hear the Pie ter van Laer Painting case, were doing no more than con-
tinuing their consistent line of jurisprudence. 1 say, "bases itself on the
argument", but 1 could equally well have said "concludes", because the
point at issue, it will readily be apparent, is a critical element, perhaps
even the crucial element, in the chain of reasoning that leads the Court, in
paragraphs 50-52 of the Judgrnent, to uphold Gerrnany's second prelimi-
nary objection, and on that basis ta dismiss Liechtenstein's Application.

disappointment lies in the uncritical way in which the Court has adopted
this argument as its own. The Court has failed, on the one hand, properly
ta distinguish the argument into its component parts, and compounded
the lapse by then failing ta subject these component parts - crucial as
they are to its chain of reasoning - to adequate scrutiny.
   9. As 1 see h, the argument that there was nothing new in the position
taken by Germany in respect of the Pie ter van Laer painting resolves
itself 10gicaHy into these three propositions: first, that there has been con-
sistency in the jurisprudence of the German courts in respect of issues
relating to the confiscation of German external pro pert y (at least since
the entry into force of the Settlement Convention in 1955); second, that
the tenor of these decisions has been compelled by the terms of the
Seulement Convention (in other words, that the German courts have had
no option but to decide as they did); and third, that it is simply these
decisions of the German courts on their own that has served to generate
the present dispute.
   10. ln my considered view, each one of those three propositions is
open to serious question. As ta the tirst issue (consistency of jurispru-
dence), the argument advanced by Germany before the Court has been
more a matter of assertion than of demonstration. Germa·ny says that its
courts have consistently held, since well before the critical date, that they
lacked the competence to hear daims in respect of property confiscated
under the Benes Decrees and similar foreign measures. Liechtenstein has
contested this assertion, notably in Appendix 1 to the Liechtenstein WrÎl-
ten Observations, which contains a schedule I1sting the key court cases
heard in Germany in the period 1953-19911. One could have wished,
indeed one would have been entitled ta expect, that Liechtenstein had
been at greater pains ta show the Court in detail what issues the German
courts had actually been confronted with, and how exactly those issues
had been dealt with. An attempt of my own to follow through the court
decisions listed in Appendix l, including those which neither Party has


    1 The Appendix also contain, an accollnl of the views expressed in the German scien-
tilic literature whicb (if tbe aocount given is an accurate one) reveals anytbing but a settled
view among the leading commentators that tbe question of tbe application of tbe Settle-
ment Convention to neutral properly bad been ,ettled by the earlier cour! decisions; quite
the contrary.



thought fit ta translate into the Court's official languages, suggests
strongly that in fact it took sorne years before the German courts settled
into the totally non possumus stance they now maintain, which in itself
implies that there was nothing inevitable about it. There are clear indi-
cations in early decisions by the highest courts (e.g., the AKU case of
1956, extracts from which are contained in Annex 2 to the Respondent's
Preliminary Objections) that room was consciously being \eft open for
the argument to be made in appropriate future cases that the Settlement
Convention did not apply, or even that it should not he applied 2 . ln other
cases dating from the same peri ad , there are clear indications of the
highest courts recognizing that they were perfectly entitled to distinguish
between different items of property in order to determine whether the
régime of the Settlement Convention (or, as the case may be, its pre-
decessor, Allied High Commission Law No. 63) did or did not come ioto
play Ce.g., the decisions of three separa te supreme courts of 1955, 1957
and 1958 listed as seriais 2,4 and 5 in the table in the Appendix referred
to above). Even in the proceedings in the Pieter van Laer Painting case
itself in the 1990s, there is repeated discussion in the \ower courts about
the preconditions that need to be met before the Sett\ement Convention 3
is applied (e.g., Landgericht K6ln, Memorial, Annex 28, esp. pp. A260 et
seq. and A264 et seq., and Oberlandesgericht Kô{n, Memorial, Annex 29,
esp. pp. A303 el seq.). Even the rejection ofthe Reigning Prince's appeal
by the Federal Constitutional Court is on the basis that the lower courts
had decided that the expropriation of his property was a measurc effected
against German external assets within the meaning of the Settlcment
Convention (Memorial, Annex 32, p. A356). And in the pleading by Ger-
many before the European Court of Human Rights one encounters once
again a discussion of the requirements, aims and pur poses of Chapter Six
that belies the bald proposition that the hands orthe German courts were
simply tied in ad vance (Memorial, Annex 36, pp. A423 et seq.).

   II. As to the second issue (the constraining force of the SeUlement
Convention), one appreciates of course that under the German Constitu-
tion, as under those of many other States, treaties duly concluded are
self-executing and l'al! to be applied directly by the courts. This is, to ail
appearances, how the German courts have treated Chapter Six of the
Sett.lement Convention, or at least how they have treated its Articles 2
and 3, since the obligation in Article 5 (to compensate the owners of confis-
cated property) seems not to have been regarded as self-executing, but ta
have depended on parliamentary legislation; and, as the Court heard in
argument, the corresponding legislation excluded the payment of compen-
sation ta non-German owners. Al! that said, however, and granted the
proposition that Articles 2 and 3 of Chapter Six of the Settlement Con-
vention were intended to be self-executing, it remains hard for any
sophisticated jurist to understand why a treaty provision requiring respect
fOf "measures ... carried out with regard to German external assets or
other property, seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution" Com-
pels the conclusion that it applies equally to non-German property4; or
(to put the proposition in its more developed fonn) why it requires the
German courts to follow, without enquiry of any kind, the qualification
placed on a confiscation by the confiscating State. Or, even if one accepts
the proposition in that more developed form, why it requires the German
courts ta do what they do without any demonstration of the qualification
placed on the pro pert y by the confiscating State, because any such
demonstration (even if one had been available in the Pieter van Laer
Painting case, which on the evidence it was not: cf. Memorial, Annex 28,
pp. A265 er seq.) would have been 0 u tside the competence of the German
courts ta receive.

   17. The thi rd issue 1 identify in paragra ph 9 above goes to the g uestion
whether it is simply the decîsions by the German courts over the years
that were the real cause of the dispute which has been brought before this
Court. Let us assume for a moment, for the purposes of argument, that
(contrary ta what 1 have shown above) the German courts did in fact
have no other option open to them when the Pieter van Laer Painting
case came before them. The question is: does the matter stop there? And
the answer to that question appears plajnly from the fact that the com-
plaint by Liechtenstein i8 directed at the adoption of that position by the
German Government in its international relations, and its interposition
as a bar to any possibility of paying compensation to Liechtenstein or its
citizens as a result (cf. paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Application institut-
ing these proceedings). That 1S something which the Court, guite cor-
rectly in my view, recognizes by implication in paragraphs 25 and 26 of
the Judgment. But, having recognized it, the Court fails to follow through.
For, if what triggered this dispute was the realization that Germany,
against all expectation, was going to tuke the position that its treaty obli-
gations to the Three Allies precluded, absolutely and permanently, com-
pensation for the confiscation of Liechtenstein property, then that was a
state of affairs (1 deliberately avoid the problematical phrase "fact or
situation") that - so it seems to me - falls exactly within the framework
of the Right of Passage Judgment, and ought at the least to have warned
the Court off what 1 regard as the facile conclusion that the present
dispute "relates ta" the BeneS Decrees, for the purposes of applying
Article 27 (a) of the European Con vention for the Peaceful Set tlemen t of
Disputes. It will be recalled that, in the Right of Passage case, the Court
found that it was not in a position ta pronounce on what were the "situa-
tions or facts" to which the dispute related until it had heard full argu-
ment on the substance, and accordingly joined the preliminary objection
to the merits (Right of Passage over /ndian Territory, Preliminary Objec-
tions, Judgment. I. CJ. Reports 1957, p. 125). The Court's reasoning for
so doing (ibid., pp. 151-152) bears a strong resemblance to the circum-
stances of the present case.

   22. Proposition (a) stands in obvious conflict with the pacta tertiis
rules in Articles 34 and 35 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, which certainly reflect the customary international law on the
subject. Yet the German argument before the Court simply parrots that
Germany had to follow its obligations (sc. towards the Three Powers)
under the Settlement Convention, as if it was obvious (including, presum-
ably, to ail third States) that Germany would oppose this Convention to
non-parties, to the detriment of the latter, and without regard to the
elementary proposition that aState cannot, by contracting with a second
State, absolve itself of its obligations towards a third State (for the appli-
cation of which rule in the treaties field, cf. Article 30 of the Vienna Con-
vention). And if the contradiction is glaring enough as it stands, how
much more glaring still must it be when what is sought to be imposed on
the third State is not even what the treaty, on its naturai meaning, seems
to say!

   27. Haying reached the aboye conclusions, 1 feel it necessary ta add
somefinal remarks.
   28. The first of these is the fairly elementary observation, which harks
back to the remark in paragraph 4 aboye, that the decision by the Court
that it has no jurisdiction to hear this case does not of itself resolye the
dispute between the two States. Ta the contrary, the Court has now
found that Liechtenstein and Germany are in dispute with one another,
that the dispute is a legal dispute, and has made its own objective deter-
mination of what the subject-matter of the dispute is. Sorne element of
res judicata doubtless attaches to those findings. One may assume that
the matter will not rest there. The leader of the German delegation ta the
bilateral consultations in June 1999 recognized that a solution needed to
be found, whether by judicial decision or otherwise. Ta have had that
unresolved dispute - whateyer its merits or demerits - settled by deci-
sion of this Court, if necessary by some l'orm of ad hoc understanding
between the disputants not to contest jurisdiction, would have been an
entirely civilized way to handle the matter, one in accordancc with the
honourable traditions ofboth States, and, needless ta say, entirely within
the spirit of the European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of Dis-
putes. But other methods, of an equally civilized character, remain open
to them as weil.
   29. The second observation may be thought a little more pointed, so 1
preface it by saying with ail emphasis that it is not offered in a critical
spirit. One cannot read the papers in this case without the feeling that,
faced with the undoubtedly difficult and highly sensitive issue of the
Benes Decrees, the German courts have taken refuge behind the Settle-
ment Convention (and previously Allied High Commission Law No. 63),
and that then the German Government has taken refuge behind the Ger-
man courts. That position, understandable as it may be in relation to the
confiscation of German property, is not a proper way of dealing with the
question of neutral property confiscated as if it were German. It is aU too
easy to portray Chapter Six of the Settlement Convention as if it were
simply a heavy burden imposed upon an unwiUing Germany. But the
truth is that Chapter Six also served to protect the newly founded Ger-
man State by absolving it of co-responsibility for the confiscations, and
al the same time absolving its courts l'rom the invidious task of having to




sit in judgment on a flood of cornplaints from its citizens about the treat-
ment visited on their property abroad. Yet the counterpart ta this protec-
tion for Germany - the necessary element for its completion - must
surely have been, quite intentionally, the obligation to compensate laid
down in Article 5 of that same Chapter (with no apparent limitation, it
may be remarked, ta German citizens ai aH). To lay daim ta the one
while disclaiming the other is surely a position that requires re-examina-
tian. One can only hope that even now sorne such re-examination may be
possible.

   30. My last observation of all goes back ta the remark at the begin-
ning of this opinion that Liechtenstein's claim in this case is a very
unusual one, requiring, shall we say, a degree of legal creativity. That is
however a question going to its mails. lt is hard ta resist the conclusion
that the Respondent - and, dare one say it, in due course the Court
itself - has allowed the difficulty it experiences in weighing the prospec-
tive legal merits of the claim ta become transmuted into an issue in
limine. However imaginative the claim, it deserved a hearing, and the
Court could with ample justification have achieved just that by joining
the second and fifth preliminary objections ta the merits.
