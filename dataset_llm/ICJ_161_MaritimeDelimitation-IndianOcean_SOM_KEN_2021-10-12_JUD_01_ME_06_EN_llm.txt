                   1. The Court found that, contrary to Kenya’s claims, the maritime
                boundary between Kenya and Somalia does not follow a parallel of latitude.
                It fixed the starting-point of the boundary in accordance with the agree-
                ments concluded between Italy and the United Kingdom in 1927 and 1933.
                It then delimited the territorial sea, in effect along the line at right angles to
                the general direction of the coast set out in those same agreements. As
                regards the exclusive economic zone (hereinafter the “EEZ”) and the conti-
                nental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, the Court did not adopt the equidis-
                tance line put forward by Somalia. With a view to achieving an equitable
                solution, it made a significant adjustment to this line in favour of Kenya.
                Finally, it rejected Somalia’s submission seeking a finding against Kenya on
                account of its unlawful activities in the disputed area. I support these deci-
                sions, but I disagree with some points of the reasoning adopted by the
                Court, and I consider it necessary to express my differences of opinion here.
                   2. Somalia requested the Court to delimit the maritime areas appertain-
                ing to it and to Kenya. Both States are parties to the United Nations Con-
                vention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter “UNCLOS”). The delimitation
                must therefore be effected in accordance with Articles 15, 74 and 83 of that
                Convention. Failing agreement between the Parties, the rules set out in those
                articles, as interpreted in the jurisprudence, must be applied. Consequently,
                the Court had first to determine whether there were any agreements in exis-
                tence between Kenya and Somalia concerning all or part of their maritime
                boundary.

                          I. Is there a Tacit Agreement between the Parties about
                                 Delimitation along a Parallel of Latitude?

                   3. Kenya claims there is. It asserts that it has fixed the northern limit
                of its maritime areas at the parallel 1° 39ʹ 43.2ʺ S. It contends that Soma-
                lia agreed to this limit by way of acquiescence. The limit is therefore the
                boundary. Somalia disputes this on three grounds. It claims:
                (a) that a maritime boundary cannot be established by acquiescence 1;
                (b) that in any event Somalia has not acquiesced to Kenya’s unilateral
                    claims 2; and
                (c) lastly, that Kenya itself has acknowledged that its boundary has never
                    been fixed 3.

                   4. The Court rightly rejected the first argument. International law is
                not formalistic. It recognizes that territorial sovereignty may be trans-
                ferred and that boundaries may be fixed by tacit agreement or by acqui-
                escence, as recalled by the Court in the Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
                case between Malaysia and Singapore 4. According to that Judgment,
                tacit agreement arises from the convergent conduct of the parties. Acqui-
                escence, for its part, results from the absence of reaction by one State to
                the positions taken by another. It is not always easy to distinguish between
                the two and, in the aforementioned Judgment, the Court itself avoided
                taking a stance on the approach to be followed. Acquiescence and tacit
                agreement both convey the consent of the States in question. In both
                cases, through different processes, the States manifest their agreement.
                   Somalia contends, however, that Articles 15, 74 and 83 of UNCLOS
                provide for the delimitation of maritime spaces by way of agreement. It
                acknowledges that these agreements may be express or tacit, but main-
                tains that UNCLOS precludes delimitation by acquiescence. Yet it is dif-
                ficult to see why the drafters of UNCLOS would have recommended that
                States fix their maritime boundaries by agreement, but excluded the pos-
                sibility of the agreed solution resulting from the acquiescence of one party
                to the positions taken by the other. It is clear that the drafters wanted
                States to reach mutually acceptable solutions, regardless of how this was
                achieved. The term “agreement” in the Convention must be understood
                to include any solution arising from the parties’ consent.

                   5. The facts of the case must also lead to the conclusion that, through
                its long silence, Somalia acquiesced to the parallel of latitude adopted
                by Kenya. The facts in this respect must be clear and “without any
                doubt” 7.

                      9. All things considered, it appears that:
                (a) Kenya did not claim the parallel of latitude for the territorial sea
                    until 2005. It did so implicitly, in the table of co-­ordinates annexed
                    to the Proclamation. Somalia objected to this position in 2009.
                    ­Somalia’s four-year silence on a proclamation formulated in this way
                      cannot constitute acquiescence.
                (b) Kenya claimed the same parallel of latitude for the continental shelf
                     beyond 200 nautical miles in 2009. Somalia immediately objected to
                    this. It therefore never acquiesced.
                (c) The situation is not so clear cut as regards the EEZ. Indeed, Kenya
                      claimed the parallel of latitude in 1979 and 2005 by presidential
                     ­proclamations circulated to all United Nations Member States, and
                    Somalia raised no objection until 2009. However, it may be asked
                    whether, in matters of such importance, circulation of this kind is
                    sufficient to give rise to a tacit agreement by acquiescence, or whether
                    a State is required to notify its neighbour of its claims directly. It
                    should also be noted that, prior to 2018, both in its negotiations with
                      Somalia and before the Court, Kenya never claimed that Somalia had
                      acquiesced, and it behaved as if the EEZ boundary had yet to be
                      established.

                  10. In 1924, 1927 and 1933, the former colonial Powers, Italy and the
                United Kingdom, concluded three agreements establishing their bound-
                ary. As successor States, Kenya and Somalia are bound by these agree-
                ments. The Court deemed this to be so (Judgment, para. 98). Nor could
                there be any doubt in this regard, in view of Articles 11 and 12 of the
                1978 Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties 21,
                the application in Africa of the rule of uti possidetis juris enshrined by


                   20 MS, Vol. III, Ann. 37, Letter of 19 August 2009. Ibid., Anns. 31 and 32, Records of

                the 2014 negotiations.
                   21 In the case concerning the Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project, the Court acknowledged

                the customary nature of Article 12 of the Convention (Gabčíkovo-­Nagymaros Project
                (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1997, p. 72, para. 123). The same conclusion
                must be drawn a fortiori with regard to Article 11, according to which “[a] succession of
                States does not as such affect . . . a boundary established by a treaty”.

                                  maritime delimitation (sep. op. guillaume)                              357

                various decisions of the Organization of African Unity 22, and the juris-
                prudence of the Court 23 and arbitral tribunals 24.
                   11. It was thus for the Court to determine whether the 1927/1933 treaty
                arrangement fixed the starting-point and course of the maritime bound-
                ary in all or part of the territorial sea.
                   12. The 1933 agreement gives binding effect to the conclusions reached
                by the Parties’ officials in 1927. It fixes with extreme precision the course
                of the land boundary from beacon to beacon, and reproduces it to the
                same effect on a map. Moreover, it provides that from the final beacon,
                PB 29, to the point known as Dar Es Salam, the boundary runs “in a
                south‑easterly direction, to the limit of territorial waters in a straight line
                at right angles to the general trend of the coastline at Dar Es Salam, leav-
                ing the islets of Diua Damasciaca in Italian territory” 25.
                   13. This provision makes it possible to fix the starting‑point of the
                maritime boundary. Contrary to what is claimed by Kenya, this cannot
                be the inland beacon PB 29. The land boundary thus continues from this
                beacon along the short stretch of around 41 metres which separates it
                from the sea. It does so in a straight line at right angles to the general
                trend of the coastline. The starting‑point of the maritime boundary is
                therefore at the intersection of that line and the coast, as rightly deter-
                mined by the Court.
                   14. In the territorial sea, the boundary must follow the same direction.
                Indeed, the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement indicates that, from beacon
                PB 29, the boundary continues in that direction up to the limit of the ter-
                ritorial sea. The arrangement further indicates that, as a result of this
                delimitation, the islets of Diua Damasciaca will be in Italian territory,
                confirming that the boundary thus fixed does indeed extend as far as the
                outer limit of the territorial sea.

                   17. I cannot support this line of reasoning. A treaty remains in force
                until such time as it is abrogated. So long as it is in force, the courts must
                apply and interpret it. Somalia’s pleadings in effect raised the question
                whether the two Parties had, by tacit agreement, abrogated the contested
                provision in so far as it applies to the territorial sea, while retaining it for
                the purposes of fixing the final segment of the land boundary and the
                starting-point of the maritime boundary. Tacit agreements, however, are
                not easily proved, as the Court moreover recalled with regard to the par-
                allel of latitude claimed by Kenya (ibid., para. 52). In this case, there is no
                evidence that such an agreement ever existed, nor was it claimed that one
                did.
                   In these circumstances, the Court should, in my view, have applied the
                1927/1933 treaty arrangement not only in fixing the starting-point of the
                maritime boundary, but also in plotting the course of that boundary in
                the territorial sea. It did not have the option of dispensing with it.
                   18. A delicate issue remains: at the time of the treaty arrangement, the
                breadth of the territorial sea was generally 3 nautical miles. Today it is
                12 miles. Should the line fixed under the arrangement stop at 3 miles or
                continue up to 12?
                   That depends on the common intention of the parties when the arrange-
                ment was made 27. In this instance, however, the travaux préparatoires are
                silent. In such an event, the Court makes a determination based on
                whether or not the terms used are generic.
                   The 1927/1933 treaty arrangement refers to the territorial sea without
                mentioning its breadth. While Great Britain was firmly committed to the

                Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, pp. 242‑244, paras. 63-71. In some instances, the Court
                has retained the original meaning of terms (see Rights of Nationals of the United States
                of America in Morocco (France v. United States of America) and Kasikili/Sedudu Island
                (Botswana/Namibia)). In others, the Court has adopted the evolving meaning (see Aegean
                Sea Continental Shelf (Greece v. Turkey) and Dispute regarding Navigational and Related
                Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)).

                                      maritime delimitation (sep. op. guillaume)                      359

                3-mile limit at the time, that limit was already disputed, by Italy in par-
                ticular 28. The negotiators must therefore have been aware that the breadth
                of the “territorial waters” might change. In my view, account must be
                taken of the developments that have occurred since 1933, and the 12-mile
                limit must be adopted.
                   The Parties’ boundary in the territorial sea thus continues up to the
                12-mile point in a straight line running in a south-­easterly direction at
                right angles to the general direction of the coast at Dar Es Salam, in
                accordance with the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement.
                   19. The Court adopted a delimitation line which is virtually the same as
                that set out in the treaty arrangement. However, it reached this result by
                drawing a median line in accordance with Article 15 of UNCLOS. It never­
                theless observed that the median line closely corresponds to that provided
                for under the 1927/1933 treaty arrangement (Judgment, para. 118).
                   20. I therefore agree with the co-­ordinates adopted by the Court and,
                consequently, voted in favour of the third subparagraph of the operative
                clause. I cannot support the reasoning adopted, however. In accordance
                with Article 15 of UNCLOS, the Court should have first determined
                whether there was an agreement between the Parties; it should then have
                concluded that such an agreement did exist, and applied it.
