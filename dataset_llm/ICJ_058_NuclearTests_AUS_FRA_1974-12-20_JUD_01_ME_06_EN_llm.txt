I concur in the Judgment delivered by the Court in the second phase of
this case, but without entirely sharing the grounds on which it has relied
to reach the conclusion that the Australian claim “no longer has any
object”.

First of all, I consider that the Court, having called upon the Applicant
to continue the proceedings and return before it so that it might rule upon
its jurisdiction to entertain the case and on the admissibility of the Appli-
cation, ought to treat these two questions clearly, especially as certain
erroneous interpretations appear to have lent credence among the lay
public to the idea that Australia ‘“had won its case against France”, since
in the final analysis it had obtained the object of its claim, which was to
have France forbidden to continue atmospheric nuclear testing.

As Isee the matter, it is extremely regrettable that the Court should have
thought it ought to omit doing this, so that unresolved problems remain
with regard to the validity of the 1928 General Act, relied on by Australia,
as also to the declaration filed under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute
and the express reservations made by France in 1966 so far as everything
connected with its national defence was concerned. It would likewise
have been more judicious to give an unequivocal ruling on the question of
admissibility, having regard to what I consider to be the definitely
political character revealed by the Australian claim, as I have recalled
above.

The fact remains that, to my mind, the Court was right to take the
decision it has taken today. I gladly subscribe—at least in part—to the
considerations which have led to its doing so, for, failing the adoption
by the Court of my position on the issues of jurisdiction and the ad-
missibility of the Australian claim, I would in any case have been of the
view that it should take into consideration, at least in the alternative, the
new facts which supervened in the course of the present proceedings and
after the closure of the oral proceedings, to wit various statements by
interested States, with a view to ascertaining whether circumstances
might not have rendered the object of the Application nugatory. Since, in
the event, it emerges that the statements urbi et orbi of the competent
French authorities constitute an undertaking on the part of France to
carry out no more nuclear tests in the atmosphere, 1 can only vote in
favour of the Judgment.

It is in effect evident that one could not rule otherwise than the Court
has done, when one analyses objectively the various statements emanating
whether from the Applicant or from France, which, confident in the reser-
vations embodied in the declaration filed under Article 36, paragraph 2,
of the Statute, contested the Court’s jurisdiction even before the opening
of oral proceedings.

As should be re-emphasized, it cannot be denied that the essential
object of Australia’s claim is to obtain from the Court the cessation by
France of the atmospheric nuclear tests it has been conducting in the
atoll of Mururoa which is situated in the South Pacific and is under
French sovereignty. Consequently, if France had changed its attitude, at
the outset of the proceedings, and had acquiesced in Australia’s request
that it should no longer carry out its tests, the goal striven for by the
Applicant would have been attained and its claim would no longer have
had any object. But now the Court has been led by the course of events to
take note that the President of the French Republic and his competent
ministers have made statements to the effect that the South Pacific test
centre will not be carrying out any more atmospheric nuclear tests. It
follows that the goal of the Application has been attained. That is a
material finding which cannot properly be denied, for it is manifest that
the object of the Australian claim no longer has any real existence. That
being so, the Court is bound to accord this fact objective recognition and
to conclude that the proceedings ought to be closed, inasmuch as it has
acquired the conviction that, taking the circumstances in which they were
made into account, the statements of the competent French authorities
are sufficient to constitute an undertaking on the part of France which
connotes a legal obligation erga omnes, despite the unilateral character of
that undertaking.

disregard of Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court—and would
thereby be likely to precipitate a general flight from the jurisdiction of the
Court, inasmuch as it would demonstrate that the Court no longer
respects the expression of the will of a State which has subordinated its
acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction to express reservations.

In conclusion, [ would like to emphasize once again that I am fully in
agreement with Australia that all atmospheric nuclear tests whatever
should be prohibited, in view of their untold implications for the survival
of mankind. 1 am nevertheless convinced that in the present case the
Court has given a proper Judgment, which meets the major anxieties
which I expressed in the dissenting opinion to which I have referred,
inasmuch as it must not appear to be flouting the principles expressed in
Article 2, paragraph 7, of the United Nations Charter (Order of 22 June
1973, I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 130), and indirectly inasmuch as it respects
the principle of sovereign equality of the member States of the United
Nations. France must not be given treatment inferior to that given to all
other States possessing nuclear weapons, and the Court’s competence
would not be well founded if it related only to the French atmospheric
tests.
