66. Article 6 (delimitation) appears to the Court to be in a different
position. It does directly relate to continental shelf rights as such, rather
than to matters incidental to these; and since it was not, as were Articles
| to 3, excluded from the faculty of reservation, it is a legitimate inference
that it was considered to have a different and less fundamental status
and not, like those Articles, to reflect pre-existing or emergent customary
law. It was however contended on behalf of Denmark and the Nether-
lands that the right of reservation given in respect of Article 6 was not
intended to be an unfettered right, and that in particular it does not
extend to effecting a total exclusion of the equidistance principle of
delimitation,—for, so it was claimed. delimitation on the basis of that
principle is implicit in Articles | and 2 of the Convention, in respect of
which no reservations are permitted. Hence the right of reservation under
Article 6 could only be exercised in a manner consistent with the preserva-
tion of at least the basic principle of equidistance. In this connection it
was pointed out that, of the no more than four reservations so far
entered in respect of Article 6, one at least of which was somewhat far-
reaching, none has purported to effect such a total exclusion or denial.

67. The Court finds this argument unconvincing for a number of
reasons. In the first place, Articles 1 and 2 of the Geneva Convention
do not appear to have any direct connection with inter-State delimitation
as such. Article 1 is concerned only with the outer, seaward, limit of
the shelf generally, not with boundaries between the shelf areas of
opposite or adjacent States. Article 2 is equally not concerned with
such boundaries. The suggestion seems to be that the notion of equidis-
tance is implicit in the reference in paragraph 2 of Article 2 to the rights
of the coastal State over its continental shelf being “exclusive”. So far as
actual language is concerned this interpretation is clearly incorrect. The
true sense of the passage is that in whatever areas of the continental
shelf a coastal State has rights, those rights are exclusive rights, not
exercisable by any other State. But this says nothing as to what in fact
are the precise areas in respect of which each coastal State possesses
these exclusive rights. This question, which can arise only as regards the
fringes of a coastal State’s shelf area is, as explained at the end of para-
graph 20 above, exactly what falls to be settled through the process of
delimitation, and this is the sphere of Article 6, not Article 2.



68, Secondly, it must be observed that no valid conclusions can be
drawn from the fact that the faculty of entering reservations to Article 6
has been exercised only sparingly and within certain limits, This is the
affair exclusively of those States which have not wished to exercise the
faculty, or which have been content to do so only to a limited extent.
Their action or inaction cannot affect the right of other States to enter
reservations to whatever is the legitimate extent of the right.

*

69. In the light of these various considerations, the Court reaches the
conclusion that the Geneva Convention did not embody or crystallize
any pre-existing or emergent rule of customary law, according to which
the delimitation of continental shelf areas between adjacent States must,
unless the Parties otherwise agree, be carried out on an equidistance-
special circumstances basis. A rule was of course embodied in Article 6
of the Convention, but as a purely conventional rule. Whether it has
since acquired a broader basis remains to be seen: qua conventional rule
however, as has already been concluded, it is not opposable to the
Federal Republic.

* + *

70. The Court must now proceed to the last stage in the argument
put forward on behalf of Denmark and the Netherlands. This is to the
effect that even if there was at the date of the Geneva Convention no rule
of customary international law in favour of the equidistance principle,
and no such rule was crystallized in Article 6 of the Convention, never-
theless such a rule has come into being since the Convention, partly
because of its own impact, partly on the basis of subsequent State prac-
tice —and that this rule, being now a rule of customary international law
binding on all States, including therefore the Federal Republic, should
be declared applicable to the delimitation of the boundaries between the
Parties’ respective continental shelf areas in the North Sea.

71. In so far as this contention is based on the view that Article 6 of
the Convention has had the influence, and has produced the effect,
described, it clearly involves treating that Article as a norm-creating
provision which has constituted the foundation of, or has generated a
rule which, while only conventional or contractual in its origin, has
since passed into the general corpus of international law, and is now
accepted as such by the opinio juris, so as to have become binding even
for countries which have never, and do not, become parties to the
Convention. There is no doubt that this process is a perfectly possible
one and does from time to time occur: it constitutes indeed one of the
recognized methods by which new rules of customary international law
may be formed. At the same time this result is not lightly to be regarded
as having been attained.

72. It would in the first place be necessary that the provision con-



cerned should, at all events potentially, be of a fundamentally norm-
creating character such as could be regarded as forming the basis of a
general rule of law. Considered in abstracto the equidistance principle
might be said to fulfil this requirement. Yet in the particular form in
which it is embodied in Article 6 of the Geneva Convention, and having
regard to the relationship of that Article to other provisions of the
Convention, this must be open to some doubt. In the first place, Article 6
is so framed as to put second the obligation to make use of the equidis-
tance method, causing it to come after a primary obligation to effect
delimitation by agreement. Such a primary obligation constitutes an
unusual preface to what is claimed to be a potential general rule of
law. Without attempting to enter into, still less pronounce upon any
question of jus cogens, it is well understood that, in practice, rules of
international law can, by agreement, be derogated from in particular
cases, or as between particular parties,—but this is not normally the
subject of any express provision, as it is in Article 6 of the Geneva Con-
vention. Secondly the part played by the notion of special circumstances
relative to the principle of equidistance as embodied in Article 6, and
the very considerable, still unresolved controversies as to the exact mean-
ing and scope of this notion, must raise further doubts as to the poten-
tially norm-creating character of the rule. Finally, the faculty of making
reservations to Article 6, while it might not of itself prevent the equidis-
tance principle being eventually received as general law, does add con-
siderably to the difficulty of regarding this result as having been brought
about (or being potentially possible) on the basis of the Convention:
for so long as this faculty continues to exist, and is not the subject of
any revision brought about in consequence of a request made under
Article 13 of the Convention—of which there is at present no official
indication—it is the Convention itself which would, for the reasons
already indicated, seem to deny to the provisions of Article 6 the same
norm-creating character as, for instance, Articles 1 and 2 possess.

73. With respect to the other elements usually regarded as necessary
before a conventional rule can be considered to have become a general
rule of international law, it might be that. even without the passage of
any considerable period of time, a very widespread and representative
participation in the convention might suffice of itself, provided it included
that of States whose interests were specially affected. In the present case
however, the Court notes that, even if allowance is made for the existence
of a number of States to whom participation in the Geneva Convention
is not open, or which, by reason for instance of being land-locked
States, would have no interest in becoming parties to it, the number of
ratifications and accessions so far secured is, though respectable, hardly
sufficient. That non-ratification may sometimes be due to factors other
than active disapproval of the convention concerned can hardly con-
stitute a basis on which positive acceptance of its principles can be
implied : the reasons are speculative, but the facts remain.



74. As regards the time element, the Court notes that it is over ten
years since the Convention was signed, but that it is even now less than
five since it came into force in June 1964, and that when the present
proceedings were brought it was less than three years, while less than
one had elapsed at the time when the respective negotiations between
the Federal Republic and the other two Parties for a complete delimita-
tion broke down on the question of the application of the equidistance
principle. Although the passage of only a short period of time is not
necessarily, or of itself, a bar to the formation of a new rule of customary
international law on the basis of what was originally a purely conven-
tional rule, an indispensable requirement would be that within the period
in question, short though it might be, State practice, including that of
States whose interests are specially affected, should have been both
extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked: —
and should moreover have occurred in such a way as to show a general
recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is involved.

*

75. The Court must now consider whether State practice in the matter
of continental shelf delimitation has, subsequent to the Geneva Conven-
tion, been of such a kind as to satisfy this requirement. Leaving aside
cases which, for various reasons, the Court does not consider to be
reliable guides as precedents, such as delimitations effected between the
present Parties themselves, or not relating to international boundaries,
some fifteen cases have been cited in the course of the present pro-
ceedings, occurring mostly since the signature of the 1958 Geneva Con-
vention, in which continental shelf boundaries have been delimited
according to the equidistance principle—in the majority of the cases by
agreement, in a few others unilaterally-—or else the delimitation was
foreshadowed but has not yet been carried out. Amongst these fifteen
are the four North Sea delimitations United Kingdom/Norway-Denmark-
Netherlands, and Norway/Denmark already mentioned in paragraph 4
of this Judgment. But even if these various cases constituted more than
a very small proportion of those potentially calling for delimitation in
the world as a whole, the Court would not think it necessary to enumerate
or evaluate them separately, since there are, a priori, several grounds
which deprive them of weight as precedents in the present context.

76. To begin with, over half the States concerned, whether acting
unilaterally or conjointly, were or shortly became parties to the Geneva
Convention, and were therefore presumably, so far as thev were con-
cerned, acting actually or potentially in the application of the Convention.
From their action no inference could legitimately be drawn as to the
existence of a rule of customary international law in favour of the
equidistance principle. As regards those States, on the other hand, which
were not, and have not become parties to the Convention, the basis of



their action can only be problematical and must remain entirely specula-
tive. Clearly, they were not applying the Convention. But from that
no inference could justifiably be drawn that they believed themselves to
be applying a mandatory rule of customary international law. There
is not a shred of evidence that they did and, as has been seen (paragraphs
22 and 23), there is no lack of other reasons for using the equidistance
method, so that acting, or agreeing to act in a certain way, does not of
itself demonstrate anything of a juridical nature.

77. The essential point in this connection—and it seems necessary to
stress it—is that even if these instances of action by non-parties to the
Convention were much more numerous than they in fact are, they would
not, even in the aggregate, suffice in themselves to constitute the opinio
juris;—for, in order to achieve this result, two conditions must be ful-
filled. Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice,
but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be
evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the
existence of a rule of law requiring it. The need for such a belief, i.e., the
existence of a subjective element, is implicit in the very notion of the
opinio juris sive necessitatis. The States concerned must therefore feel
that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation. The
frequency, or even habitual character of the acts is not in itself enough.
There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of ceremonial and
protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but which are motivated
only by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition, and not
by any sense of legal duty.

78. In this respect the Court follows the view adopted by the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case, as stated in the fol-
lowing passage, the principle of which is, by analogy, applicable almost
word for word, mutatis mutandis, to the present case (P.C.I.J., Series A,
No. 10, 1927, at p. 28):

“Even if the rarity of the judicial decisions to be found ... were
sufficient to prove . . . the circumstance alleged . . ., it would merely
show that States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting
criminal proceedings, and not that they recognized themselves as
being obliged to do so; for only if such abstention were based on
their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible
to speak of an international custom. The alleged fact does not allow
one to infer that States have been conscious of having such a duty;
on the other hand, ... there are other circumstances calculated to
show that the contrary is true.”

Applying this dictum to the present case, the position is simply that in
certain cases—not a great number—the States concerned agreed to draw
or did draw the boundaries concerned according to the principle of
equidistance. There is no evidence that they so acted because they felt



legally compelled to draw them in this way by reason of a rule of custom-
ary law obliging them to do so—especially considering that they might
have been motivated by other obvious factors.

79. Finally, it appears that in almost all of the cases cited, the delimi-
tations concerned were median-line delimitations between opposite
States, not lateral delimitations between adjacent States. For reasons
which have already been given (paragraph 57) the Court regards the case
of median-line delimitations between opposite States as different in
various respects, and as being sufficiently distinct not to constitute a
precedent for the delimitation of lateral boundaries. In only one situation
discussed by the Parties does there appear to have been a geographical
configuration which to some extent resembles the present one, in the
sense that a number of States on the same coastline are grouped around
a sharp curve or bend of it. No complete delimitation in this area has
however yet been carried out. But the Court is not concerned to deny to
this case, or any other of those cited, all evidential value in favour of the
thesis of Denmark and the Netherlands. It simply considers that they
are inconclusive, and insufficient to bear the weight sought to be put
upon them as evidence of such a settled practice, manifested in such
circumstances, as would justify the inference that delimitation according
to the principle of equidistance amounts to a mandatory rule of customary
international law,-—more particularly where lateral delimitations are
concerned. -

80. There are of course plenty of cases (and a considerable number
were cited) of delimitations of waters, as opposed to seabed, being carried
out on the basis of equidistance—mostly of internal waters (lakes, rivers,
etc.), and mostly median-line cases. The nearest analogy is that of ad-
jacent territorial waters, but as already explained (paragraph 59) the
Court does not consider this case to be analogous to that of the con-
tinental shelf.

81. The Court accordingly concludes that if the Geneva Convention
was not in its origins or inception declaratory of a mandatory rule of
customary international law enjoining the use of the equidistance prin-
ciple for the delimitation of continental shelf areas between adjacent
States, neither has its subsequent effect been constitutive of such a rule;
and that State practice up-to-date has equally been insufficient for the
purpose.

82. The immediately foregoing conclusion, coupled with that reached
earlier (paragraph 56) to the effect that the equidistance principle could
not be regarded as being a rule of law on any a priori basis of logical



necessity deriving from the fundamental theory of the continental shelf,
leads to the final conclusion on this part of the case that the use of the
equidistance method is not obligatory for the delimitation of the areas
concerned in the present proceedings. In these circumstances, it becomes
unnecessary for the Court to determine whether or not the configuration
of the German North Sea coast constitutes a “special circumstance” for
the purposes either of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention or of any rule
of customary international law,—since once the use of the equidistance
method of delimitation is determined not to be obligatory in any event,
it ceases to be legally necessary to prove the existence of special circum-
stances in order to justify not using that method.

* * # *

83. The legal situation therefore is that the Parties are under no obliga-
tion to apply either the 1958 Convention, which is not opposable to the
Federal Republic, or the equidistance method as a mandatory rule of
customary law, which it is not. But as between States faced with an issue
concerning the lateral delimitation of adjacent continental shelves, there
are still rules and principles of law to be applied; and in the present case
it is not the fact either that rules are lacking, or that the situation is one
for the unfettered appreciation of the Parties. Equally, it is not the case
that if the equidistance principle is not a rule of law, there has to be as
an alternative some other single equivalent rule.

84. As already indicated, the Court is not called upon itself to delimit
the areas of continental shelf appertaining respectively to each Party,
and in consequence is not bound to prescribe the methods to be em-
ployed for the purposes of such a delimitation. The Court has to indicate
to the Parties the principles and rules of law in the light of which the
methods for eventually effecting the delimitation will have to be chosen.
The Court will discharge this task in such a way as to provide the Parties
with the requisite directions, without substituting itself for them by means
of a detailed indication of the methods to be followed and the factors to
be taken into account for the purposes of a delimitation the carrying out
of which the Parties have expressly reserved to themselves.

85. It emerges from the history of the development of the legal régime
of the continental shelf, which has been reviewed earlier, that the essential
reason why the equidistance method is not to be regarded as a rule of
law is that, if it were to be compulsorily applied in all situations, this
would not be consonant with certain basic legal notions which, as has
been observed in paragraphs 48 and 55, have from the beginning reflected
the opinio juris in the matter of delimitation; those principles being that
delimitation must be the object of agreement between the States con-
cerned, and that such agreement must be arrived at in accordance with
equitable principles. On a foundation of very general precepts of justice
and good faith, actual rules of law are here involved which govern the



delimitation of adjacent continental shelves—that is to say, rules binding
upon States for all delimitations;—ih-short, it is not a question of apply-
ing equity simply as a matter of abstract justice, but of applying a rule
of law which itself requires the application of equitable principles, in
accordance with the ideas which have always underlain the development
of the legal régime of the continental shelf in this field, namely:

(a) the parties are under an obligation to enter into negotiations with a
view to arriving at an agreement, and not merely to go through a
formal process of negotiation as a sort of prior condition for the
automatic application of a certain method of delimitation in the
absence of agreement; they are under an obligation so to conduct
themselves that the negotiations are meaningful, which will not be
the case when either of them insists upon its own position without
contemplating any modification of it;

(b) the parties are under an obligation to act in such a way that, in the
particular case, and taking all the circumstances into account,
equitable principles are applied,—for this purpose the equidistance
method can be used, but other methods exist and may be employed,
alone or in combination, according to the areas involved;

(ce) for the reasons given in paragraphs 43 and 44, the continental shelf
of any State must be the natural prolongation of its land territory
and must not encroach upon what is the natural prolongation of the
territory of another State.

*
* *

86. It is now necessary to examine these rules more closely, as also
certain problems relative to their application. So far as the first rule is
concerned, the Court would recall not only that the obligation to nego-
tiate which the Parties assumed by Article I, paragraph 2, of the Special
Agreements arises out of the Truman Proclamation, which, for the
reasons given in paragraph 47, must be considered as having propounded
the rules of law in this field, but also that this obligation merely constitutes
a special application of a principle which underlies all international
relations, and which is moreover recognized in Article 33 of the Charter
of the United Nations as one of the methods for the peaceful settlement
of international disputes. There is no need to insist upon the fundamental
character of this method of settlement, except to point out that it is
emphasized by the observable fact that judicial or arbitral settlement is
not universally accepted.

87. As the Permanent Court of International Justice said in its Order
of 19 August 1929 in the case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the
District of Gex, the judicial settlement of international disputes “is
simply an alternative to the direct and friendly settlement of such dis-
putes between the parties” (P.C.T.J., Series A, No. 22, at p. 13). Defining
the content of the obligation to negotiate, the Permanent Court, in its



Advisory Opinion in the case of Railway Traffic between Lithuania and
Poland, said that the obligation was “not only to enter into negotiations
but also to pursue them as far as possible with a view to concluding
agreements”, even if an obligation to negotiate did not imply an obliga-
tion to reach agreement (P.C./.J., Series A/B, No. 42, 1931, at p. 116).
In the present case, it needs to be observed that whatever the details of
the negotiations carried on in 1965 and 1966, they failed of their purpose
because the Kingdoms of Denmark and the Netherlands, convinced
that the equidistance principle alone was applicable, in consequence of a
rule binding upon the Federal Republic, saw no reason to depart from
that rule; and equally, given the geographical considerations stated in
the last sentence of paragraph 7 above, the Federal Republic could not
accept the situation resulting from the application of that rule. So far
therefore the negotiations have not satisfied the conditions indicated in
paragraph 85 (a), but fresh negotiations are to take place on the basis
of the present Judgment.

88. The Court comes next to the rule of equity. The legal basis of that
rule in the particular case of the delimitation of the continental shelf as
between adjoining States has already been stated. It must however be
noted that the rule rests also on a broader basis. Whatever the legal
reasoning of a court of justice, its decisions must by definition be just,
and therefore in that sense equitable. Nevertheless, when mention is
made of a court dispensing justice or declaring the law, what is meant is
that the decision finds its objective justification in considerations lying
not outside but within the rules, and in this field it is precisely a rule of
law that calls for the application of equitable principles. There is con-
sequently no question in this case of any decision ex aequo et bono, such
as would only be possible under the conditions prescribed by Article 38,
paragraph 2, of the Court's Statute. Nor would this be the first time that
the Court has adopted such an attitude, as is shown by the following
passage from the Advisory Opinion given in the case of Judgments of the
Administrative Tribunal of the T.L.O. upon Complaints Made against
Unesco (I.C.J. Reports 1956, at p. 100):

“In view of this the Court need not examine the allegation that
the validity of the judgments of the Tribunal is vitiated by excess of
jurisdiction on the ground that it awarded compensation ex aequo
et bono. It will confine itself to stating that, in the reasons given by
the Tribunal in support of its decision on the merits, the Tribunal
said: ‘That redress will be ensured ex aequo et bono by the granting
to the complainant of the sum set forth below.’ It does not appear
from the context of the judgment that the Tribunal thereby intended
to depart from principles of law. The apparent intention was to say



that, as the precise determination of the actual amount to be awarded
could not be based on any specific rule of law, the Tribunal fixed
what the Court, in other circumstances, has described as the true
measure of compensation and the reasonable figure of such com-
pensation (Corfu Channel case, Judgment of December 15th, 1949,
I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 249).”

89. It must next be observed that, in certain geographical cireum-
stances which are quite frequently met with, the equidistance method,
despite its known advantages, leads unquestionably to inequity, in the
following sense:

(a) The slightest irregularity in a coastline is automatically magnified by
the equidistance line as regards the consequences for the delimita-
tion of the continental shelf. Thus it has been scen in the case of
concave or convex coastlines that if the equidistance method is
employed, then the greater the irregularity and the further from the
coastline the area to be delimited, the more unreasonable are the
results produced. So great an exaggeration of the consequences of
a natural geographical feature must be remedied or compensated
for as far as possible, being of itself creative of inequity.

(b) In the case of the North Sea in particular, where there is no outer
boundary to the continental shelf, it happens that the claims of
several States converge, meet and intercross in localities where,
despite their distance from the coast, the bed of the sea still un-
questionably consists of continental shelf. A study of these con-
vergences, as revealed by the maps, shows how inequitable would
be the apparent simplification brought about by a delimitation
which, ignoring such geographical circumstances, was based solely
on the equidistance method.

90. If for the above reasons equity excludes the use of the equidistance
method in the present instance, as the sole method of delimitation, the
question arises whether there is any necessity to employ only one method
for the purposes of a given delimitation. There is no logical basis for this,
and no objection need be felt to the idea of effecting a delimitation of
adjoining continental shelf areas by the concurrent use of various
methods. The Court has already stated why it considers that the inter-
national law of continental shelf delimitation does not involve any im-
perative rule and permits resort to various principles or methods, as may
be appropriate, or a combination of them, provided that, by the applica-
tion of equitable principles, a reasonable result is arrived at.

91. Equity does not necessarily imply equality. There can never be
any question of completely refashioning nature, and equity does not
require that a State without access to the sea should be allotted an area
of continental shelf, any more than there could be a question of rendering
the situation of a State with an extensive coastline similar to that of a



State with a restricted coastline. Equality is to be reckoned within the
same plane, and it is not such natural inequalities as these that equity
could remedy. But in the present case there are three States whose North
Sea coastlines are in fact comparable in length and which, therefore,
have been given broadly equal treatment by nature except that the con-
figuration of one of the coastlines would, if the equidistance method is
used, deny to one of these States treatment equal or comparable to that
given the other two. Here indeed is a case where, in a theoretical situation
of equality within the same order, an inequity is created. What is un-
acceptable in this instance is that a State should enjoy continental shelf
rights considerably different from those of its neighbours merely because
in the one case the coastline is roughly convex in form and in the other
it is markedly concave, although those coastlines are comparable in
length. It is therefore not a question of totally refashioning geography
whatever the facts of the situation but, given a geographical situation of
quasi-equality as between a number of States, of abating the effects of
an incidental special feature from which an unjustifiable difference of
treatment could result.

92, It has however been maintained that no one method of delimita-
tion can prevent such results and that all can lead to relative injustices.
This argument has in effect already been dealt with. It can only strengthen
the view that it is necessary to seek not one method of delimitation but
one goal. It is in this spirit that the Court must examine the question of
how the continental shelf can be delimited when it is in fact the case that
the equidistance principle does not provide an equitable solution. As the
operation of delimiting is a matter of determining areas appertaining to
different jurisdictions, it is a truism to say that the determination must be
equitable; rather is the problem above all one of defining the means where-
by the delimitation can be carried out in such a way as to be recognized
as equitable. Although the Parties have made it known that they intend
to reserve for themselves the application of the principles and rules laid
down by the Court, it would, even so, be insufficient simply to rely on the
rule of equity without giving some degree of indication as to the possible
ways in which it might be applied in the present case, it being understood
that the Parties will be free to agree upon one method rather than an-
other, or different methods if they so prefer.

93. In fact, there is no legal limit to the considerations which States
may take account of for the purpose of making sure that they apply
equitable procedures, and more often than not it is the balancing-up of
all such considerations that will produce this result rather than reliance
on one to the exclusion of all others. The problem of the relative weight
to be accorded to different considerations naturally varies with the circum-
stances of the case.

94. In balancing the factors in question it would appear that various
aspects must be taken into account. Some are related to the geological,
others to the geographical aspect of the situation, others again to the



idea of the unity of any deposits, These criteria, though not entirely
precise, can provide adequate bases for decision adapted to the factual
situation.

95. The institution of the continental shelf has arisen out of the recog-
nition of a physical fact; and the link between this fact and the law, with-
out which that institution would never have existed, remains an im-
portant element for the application of its legal régime. The continental
shelf is, by definition, an area physically extending the territory of most
coastal States into a species of platform which has attracted the attention
first of geographers and hydrographers and then of jurists. The impor-
tance of the geological aspect is emphasized by the care which, at the
beginning of its investigation, the International Law Commission took
to acquire exact information as to its characteristics, as can be seen in
particular from the definitions to be found on page 131 of Volume 1
of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission for 1956. The ap-
purtenance of the shell to the countries in front of whose coastlines it
lies, is therefore a fact, and it can be useful to consider the geology of
that shelf in order to find out whether the direction taken by certain
configurational features should influence delimitation because, in certain
localities, they point-up the whole notion of the appurtenance of the
continental shelf to the State whose territory it does in fact prolong.

96. The doctrine of the continental shelf is a recent instance of en-
croachment on maritime expanses which, during the greater part of
history, appertained to no-one. The contiguous zone and the continental
shelf are in this respect concepts of the same kind. In both instances the
principle is applied that the land dominates the sea: it is consequently
necessary to examine closely the geographical configuration of the coast-
lines of the countries whose continental shelves are to be delimited. This
is one of the reasons why the Court does not consider that markedly
pronounced configurations can be ignored; for, since the land is the legal
source of the power which a State mav exercise over territorial extensions
to scaward, it must first be clearly established what features do in fact
constitute such extensions. Above all is this the case when what is in-
volved is no longer areas of sea, such as the contiguous zone, but stretches
of submerged land; for the legal régime of the continental shelf is that
of a soil and a subsoil, two words evocative of the land and not of the sea.

97. Another factor to be taken into consideration in the delimitation
of areas of continental shelf as between adjacent States is the unity of
any deposits. The natural resources of the subsoil of the sea in those parts
which consist of continental shelf arc the very object of the legal régime
established subsequent to the Truman Proclamation. Yet it frequently
occurs that the same deposit lies on both sides of the line dividing a con-
tinental shelf between two States, and since it is possible to exploit such
a deposit from either side, a problem immediately arises on account of
the risk of prejudicial or wasteful exploitation by one or other of the
States concerned. To look no farther than the North Sea, the practice



of States shows how this problem has been dealt with, and all that is
needed is to refer to the undertakings entered into by the coastal States
of that sea with a view to ensuring the most efficient exploitation or the
apportionment of the products extracted—(see in particular the agree-
ment of 10 March 1965 between the United Kingdom and Norway,
Article 4; the agreement of 6 October 1965 between the Netherlands and
the United Kingdom relating to “the exploitation of single geological
structures extending across the dividing line on the continental shelf
under the North Sea”; and the agreement of 14 May 1962 between the
Federal Republic and the Netherlands concerning a joint plan for ex-
ploiting the natural resources underlying the area of the Ems Estuary
where the frontier between the two States has not been finally delimited.)
The Court does not consider that unity of deposit constitutes anything
more than a factual element which it is reasonable to take into considera-
tion in the course of the negotiations for a delimitation, The Parties are
fully aware of the existence of the problem as also of the possible ways of
solving it.

98. A final factor to be taken account of is the element of a reason-
able degree of proportionality which a delimitation effected according
to equitable principles ought to bring about between the extent of the
continental shelf appertaining to the States concerned and the lengths
of their respective coastlines,—these being measured according to their
general direction in order to establish the necessary balance between
States with straight, and those with markedly concave or convex coasts,
or to reduce very irregular coastlines to their truer proportions. The
choice and application of the appropriate technical methods would be
a matter for the parties. One method discussed in the course of the pro-
ceedings, under the name of the principle of the coastal front, consists
in drawing a straight baseline between the extreme points at either end
of the coast concerned, or in some cases a series of such lines. Where the
parties wish to employ in particular the equidistance method of delimita-
tion, the establishment of one or more baselines of this kind can play
a useful part in eliminating or diminishing the distortions that might
result from the use of that method.

99. In a sea with the particular configuration of the North Sea, and
in view of the particular geographical situation of the Parties’ coastlines
upon that sea, the methods chosen by them for the purpose of fixing the
delimitation of their respective areas may happen in certain localities to
lead to an overlapping of the areas appertaining to them. The Court
considers that such a situation must be accepted as a given fact and
resolved either by an agreed, or failing that by an equal division of the
overlapping areas, or by agreements for joint exploitation, the latter
solution appearing particularly appropriate when it is a question of
preserving the unity of a deposit.



100. The Court has examined the problems raised by the present case
in its own context, which is strictly that of delimitation. Other questions
relating to the general legal régime of the continental shelf, have been
examined for that purpose only. This régime furnishes an example of a
legal theory derived from a particular source that has secured a general
following. As the Court has recalled in the first part of its Judgment, it
was the Truman Proclamation of 28 September 1945 which was at the
origin of the theory, whose special features reflect that origin. It would
therefore not be in harmony with this history to over-systematize a
pragmatic construct the developments of which have occurred within
a relatively short space of time.

101. For these reasons,
THE COURT,

by eleven votes to six,
finds that, in each case,

(A) the use of the equidistance method of delimitation not being
obligatory as between the Parties; and

(B) there being no other single method of delimitation the use of
which is in all circumstances obligatory;

(C) the principles and rules of international law applicable to the
delimitation as between the Parties of the areas of the continental shelf
in the North Sea which appertain to each of them beyond the partial
boundary determined by the agreements of | December 1964 and 9 June
1965, respectively, are as follows:

(1) delimitation is to be effected by agreement in accordance with
equitable principles, and taking account of all the relevant cireum-
stances, in such a way as to leave as much as possible to each Party
all those parts of the continental shelf that constitute a natural
prolongation of its land territory into and under the sea, without
encroachment on the natural prolongation of the land territory of
the other;

(2) if, in the application of the preceding sub-paragraph, the delimitation
leaves to the Parties areas that overlap, these are to be divided be-
tween them in agreed proportions or, failing agreement, equally,
unless they decide on a régime of joint jurisdiction, user, or exploita-
tion for the zones of overlap or any part of them;

(D) in the course of the negotiations, the factors to be taken into
account are to include:



(1) the general configuration of the coasts of the Parties, as well as the
presence of any special or unusual features;

(2) so far as known or readily ascertainable, the physical and geological
structure, and natural resources, of the continental shelf areas in-
volved;

(3) the element of a reasonable degree of proportionality, which a delimi-
tation carried out in accordance with equitable principles ought to
bring about between the extent of the continental shelf areas apper-
taining to the coastal State and the length of its coast measured in
the general direction of the coastline, account being taken for this
purpose of the effects, actual or prospective, of any other continental
shelf delimitations between adjacent States in the same region.

Judge Sir Muhammad ZAFRULLA KHAN makes the following declara-
tion:

T am in agreement with the Judgment throughout but would wish to
add the following observations.

The essence of the dispute between the Parties is that the two Kingdoms
claim that the delimitation effected between them under the Agreement
of 31 March 1966 is binding upon the Federal Republic and that the
Federal Republic is bound to accept the situation resulting therefrom,
which would confine its continental shelf to the triangle formed by lines
ABE and C-D-E in Map 3. The Federal Republic stoutly resists that
claim.

Not only is Article 6 of the Geneva Convention of 1958 not opposable
to the Federal Republic but the delimitation effected under the Agree-
ment of 31 March 1966 does not derive from the provisions of that Article
as Denmark and the Netherlands are neither States “whose coasts are
opposite each other” within the meaning of the first paragraph of that
Article nor are they “two adjacent States” within the meaning of the



second paragraph of that Article. The situation resulting from that delimi-
tation, so far as it affects the Federal Republic is not, therefore, brought
about by the application of the principle set out in either of the paragraphs
of Article 6 of the Convention.

Had paragraph 2 of Article 6 been applicable to the delimitation of
the continental shelf between the Parties to the dispute, a boundary line,
determined by the application of the principle of equidistance, would
have had to allow for the configuration of the coastline of the Federal
Republic as a “special circumstance”.

In the course of the oral pleadings the contention that the principle
of equidistance cum special circumstances had crystallized into a rule of
customary international law was not advanced on behalf of the two
Kingdoms as an alternative to the claim that that principle was inherent
in the very concept of the continental shelf. The Judgment has, in fair-
ness, dealt with these two contentions as if they had been put forward
in the alternative and were thus consistent with each other, and has
rejected each of them on the merits. I am in agreement with the reasoning
of the Judgment on both these points. But, I consider, it is worth men-
tioning that Counsel for the two Kingdoms summed up their position
in regard to the effect of the 1958 Convention as follows:

“... They have not maintained that the Convention embodied al-
ready received rules of customary law in the sense that the Conven-
tion was merely declaratory of existing rules. Their position is rather
that the doctrine of the coastal State's exclusive rights over the
adjacent continental shelf was in process of formation between 1945
and 1958: that the State practice prior to 1958 showed fundamental
variations in the nature and scope of the rights claimed: that, in
consequence, in State practice the emerging doctrine was wholly
lacking in any definition of these crucial elements as it was also of
the legal régime applicable to the coastal State with respect to the
continental shelf’; that the process of the definition and consolidation
of the emerging customary law took place through the work of the
International Law Commission, the reaction of governments to that
work and the proceedings of the Geneva Conference: that the
emerging customary law, now become more defined. both as to the
rights of the coastal State and the applicable régime, crystallized in
the adoption of the Continental Shelf Convention by the Conference;
and that the numerous signatures and ratifications of the Convention
and the other State practice based on the principles set out in the
Convention had the effect of consolidating those principles as cus-
tomary law.”

If it were correct that the doctrine of the coastal State's exclusive
rights over the adjacent continental shelf was in process of formation



between 1945 and 1958 and that in State practice prior to 1958 it was
wholly lacking in any definition of crucial elements as it was also of the
legal régime applicable to the coastal State with respect to the continental
shelf, then it would seem to follow conclusively that the principle of
equidistance was not inherent in the concept of the continental shelf.

Judge BENGZON makes the following declaration:

[ regret my inability to concur with the main conclusions of the
majority of the Court. T agree with my colleagues who maintain the view
that Article 6 of the Geneva Convention is the applicable international
law and that as between these Parties equidistance is the rule for delimita-
tion, which rule may even be derived from the general principles of law.
