breach of Article X, paragraph 1 — Jurisdiction based on Article XXI, para-
graph 2 — Factual background.

United States contention that the Court should reject Iran's claims and refuse
it the relief it seeks because of Iran's allegedly unlawful conduct — “Clean
hands” — Argument not presented as objection to admissibility — Not neces-
sary to decide the issue.

#

franian claims based on Article X, paragraph 1, of Treaty — Alleged
infringement of freedom of commerce between the territories of the Parties by
attack on Iranian oil platforms — Judgment of 12 December 1996 on jurisdic-
tion — Relevance of other Articles for interpretation or application of Article X,
paragraph 1 — Task of the Court to ascertain whether there has been a
breach of Article X, paragraph 1 — United States contention that Article XX,
paragraph 1 (d), concerning measures necessary to protect the essential security
interests of a party, is determinative of the question — Order in which the Court
should examine Articles X, paragraph 1, and XX, paragraph 1 (d) — Freedom
of Court to choose grounds for its decision — Particular considerations in this
case militating in favour of an examination of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d),
prior to Article X, paragraph 1 — Relationship between Article XX, para-
graph 1 (d), and international law on the use of force — Jurisdiction of the
Court to interpret and apply Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), extending, where
appropriate, to the determination whether action was or not unlawful use of

force, by reference to international law — Provisions of the United Nations



Charter and customary international law — Jurisdiction of the Court limited
to that conferred by the consent of the Parties.

Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) — Measures “necessary” to protect the party's
essential security interests — Criterion of “necessity” to be assessed by the
Court — Overlapping of question whether the measures taken were “necessary”
and of their validity as acts of self-defence — Actions on the platforms amounted
to a use of force.

Attack of 19 October 1987 on Reshadat — United States contention that this
action was necessary to protect its essential security interests and a valid act of
self-defence — Question of the existence of an “armed attack” on the United
States — Missile attack on the Sea Isle City — Burden of proof of the existence
of an attack by Iran on the United States not discharged — Alleged series of
attacks by Iran not an “armed attack” on the United States — Attacks of
18 April 1988 on Nasr and Salman and “Operation Praying Mantis” — Mining
of the USS Samuel B. Roberts — Evidence inconclusive that the vessel was the
victim of a mine laid by Iran — Mine incident not an “armed attack” by Iran
against the United States.

Examination of criteria of necessity and proportionality in the context of self-
defence — Nature of the target of the force used in self-defence: insufficient
evidence as to the significance of the military presence and activity on the plat-
forms — Attacks on the platforms not meeting the criteria of necessity and pro-
portionality under the right of self-defence.

Attacks on the platforms not justified, under Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), as
measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United
States, being acts of armed force not qualifying under international law as acts
of self-defence.

Article X, paragraph 1 — Scope of the 1996 Judgment — Question whether
the United States actions affected “freedom of commerce” under Article X,
paragraph 1 — Meaning of “commerce” in that text — Not limited to maritime
commerce nor to activities of purchase and sale — No justification for treating
platforms as military installations, and thus outside protection of Article X,
paragraph 1.

Nature of commercial activities protected — United States attacks entailing
destruction of goods destined to be exported and affecting transport of these
goods with a view to export — Attacks impeded Iran's freedom of commerce —
Treaty limitation to freedom of commerce “between the territories of the two
High Contracting Parties” — Exports of Iranian oil to United States territory
until 29 October 1987 — Reshadat and Resalat platforms under repair at the



time they were attacked — United States Executive Order 12613 of 29 October
1987 imposing an embargo on goods of Iranian origin — No exports of Iranian
crude oil to the United States after 29 October 1987 — Legality of the embargo
not before the Court — Salman and Nasr platforms attacked after enactment of
embargo — Import into United States of petroleum products derived from
Iranian crude oil not constituting “commerce between the territories” of the
Parties for the purposes of the 1955 Treaty — Attacks on the platforms not a
breach of Article X, paragraph 1.

Examination of specific incidents invoked by the United States — None of the
vessels involved engaged in commerce or navigation between the territories of
the Parties — No breach of Article X, paragraph 1 — United States generic
counter-claim — No proof that actions of Iran infringed the freedom of com-
merce or of navigation between the territories of the Parties — No specific inci-
dent constituted a breach of Treaty — Generic counter-claim cannot be upheld.

THE COURT,

composed as above,
after deliberation,

delivers the following Judgment:

1. On 2 November 1992, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
(hereinafter called “Iran”) filed in the Registry of the Court an Application
instituting proceedings against the Government of the United States of America
(hereinafter called “the United States”) in respect of a dispute

“aris[ing] out of the attack [on] and destruction of three offshore oil pro-
duction complexes, owned and operated for commercial purposes by the
National Iranian Oil Company, by several warships of the United States
Navy on 19 October 1987 and 18 April 1988, respectively”.

In its Application, Iran contended that these acts constituted a “fundamental
breach” of various provisions of the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and
Consular Rights between the United States and Iran, which was signed in
Tehran on 15 August 1955 and entered into force on 16 June 1957 (hereinafter
called “the 1955 Treaty”), as well as of international law. The Application
invoked, as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction, Article XXI, paragraph 2, of
the 1955 Treaty.

2. Pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Application was
immediately communicated to the Government of the United States by the
Registrar; and, pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article, all States entitled to
appear before the Court were notified of the Application.

3. By an Order of 4 December 1992 the President of the Court fixed 31 May
1993 as the time-limit for the filing of the Memorial of Iran and 30 November
1993 as the time-limit for the filing of the Counter-Memorial of the United
States.

4. By an Order of 3 June 1993 the President of the Court, at the request of
Iran, extended to 8 June 1993 the time-limit for the filing of the Memorial; the
time-limit for the filing of the Counter-Memorial was extended, by the same
Order, to 16 December 1993.

Iran duly filed its Memorial within the time-limit as thus extended.

5. Within the extended time-limit thus fixed for the filing of the Counter-
Memorial, the United States raised a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction
of the Court pursuant to Article 79, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court of
14 April 1978. Consequently, by an Order dated 18 January 1994, the President
of the Court, noting that by virtue of Article 79, paragraph 3, of the Rules of
Court the proceedings on the merits were suspended, fixed 1 July 1994 as the
time-limit within which Iran might present a written statement of its observa-
tions and submissions on the preliminary objection raised by the United States.

Iran filed such a statement within the time-limit so fixed and the case became
ready for hearing in respect of the preliminary objection.

6. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of Iranian nationality,
Iran availed itself of its right under Article 31, paragraph 2, of the Statute of
the Court to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the case: it chose Mr. Frangois
Rigaux.



7. Between 16 and 24 September 1996, the Court held public hearings on the
preliminary objection raised by the United States.

8. By a Judgment dated 12 December 1996 the Court rejected the prelimi-
nary objection of the United States according to which the 1955 Treaty did not
provide any basis for the jurisdiction of the Court and found that it had juris-
diction, on the basis of Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty, to enter-
tain the claims made by Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of that Treaty.

9. By an Order of 16 December 1996 the President of the Court fixed 23 June
1997 as the time-limit for the filing of the Counter-Memorial of the United
States.

Within the time-limit thus fixed, the United States filed its Counter-
Memorial; this included a counter-claim concerning “Iran’s actions in the Gulf
during 1987-88 which, among other things, involved mining and other attacks
on US-flag or US-owned vessels”.

10. In a letter of 2 October 1997 Iran expressed its opinion that “the counter-
claim as formulated by the United States [did] not meet the requirements of
Article 80 (1) of the Rules” and its wish “to submit a brief statement explaining
its objections to the counter-claim”.

At a meeting held on 17 October 1997 with the Agents of the Parties by
the Vice-President of the Court, acting as President in the case by virtue of
Article 13, paragraph 1, and Article 32, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court,
the two Agents agreed that their respective Governments would submit written
observations on the question of the admissibility of the United States counter-
claim.

By a communication from its Agent dated 18 November 1997, Iran trans-
mitted to the Court a document entitled “Request for hearing in relation to the
United States counter-claim pursuant to Article 80 (3) of the Rules of Court”;
by a letter dated 18 November 1997 the Registrar sent a copy of that document
to the United States Government. By a communication from its Agent dated
18 December 1997, the United States submitted to the Court its observations
on the admissibility of the counter-claim set out in its Counter-Memorial,
taking the observations submitted by Iran into consideration; by a letter dated
18 December 1997, the Registrar communicated a copy of the observations of
the United States Government to the Iranian Government.

Having received detailed written observations from each of the Parties, the
Court considered that it was sufficiently well informed of their respective posi-
tions with regard to the admissibility of the counter-claim.

11. By an Order of 10 March 1998 the Court held that the counter-claim
presented by the United States in its Counter-Memorial was admissible as such
and formed part of the current proceedings. It also directed Iran to file a Reply
and the United States to file a Rejoinder, relating to the claims of both Parties,
and fixed the time-limits for the filing of the Reply and of the Rejoinder at
10 September 1998 and 23 November 1999 respectively. The Court held that it
was necessary moreover,

“in order to ensure strict equality between the Parties, to reserve the right
of Iran to present its views in writing a second time on the United States



counter-claim, in an additional pleading the filing of which [might] be the
subject of a subsequent Order”.

12. By Order of 26 May 1998, at the request of Iran, the Vice-President of
the Court, acting as President in the case, extended the time-limits for the filing
of the Reply of Iran and of the Rejoinder of the United States to, respectively,
10 December 1998 and 23 May 2000. By Order of 8 December 1998, at the
request of Iran, the Court subsequently extended the time-limits for the filing
of the Reply and of the Rejoinder to 10 March 1999 and 23 November 2000
respectively.

Iran duly filed its “Reply and Defence to Counter-Claim” within the time-
limit as thus extended.

By Order of 4 September 2000, at the request of the United States, the Presi-
dent of the Court extended the time-limit for the filing of the Rejoinder of the
United States to 23 March 2001.

The United States duly filed its Rejoinder within the time-limit as thus
extended.

13. By a letter dated 30 July 2001, the Agent of Iran, referring to the above-
mentioned Order of 10 March 1998, informed the Court that his Government
wished to present its views in writing a second time on the counter-claim of the
United States.

By an Order of 28 August 2001 the Vice-President of the Court, taking
account of the agreement of the Parties, authorized the submission by Iran of
an additional pleading relating solely to the counter-claim submitted by the
United States and fixed 24 September 2001 as the time-limit for the filing of
that pleading.

Iran duly filed the additional pleading within the time-limit as thus fixed and
the case became ready for hearing.

14. At a meeting with the President of the Court on 6 November 2002, the
Agent of Iran, subject to confirmation, and the Agent of the United States
agreed that the oral proceedings on the merits should begin on 17 or 18 Feb-
ruary 2003; the Agent of Iran subsequently confirmed the agreement of his
Government. At the same meeting the Agents of the Parties also presented their
views on the organization of the oral proceedings on the merits.

Pursuant to Articles 54 and 58 of the Rules, the Court fixed 17 Febru-
ary 2003 as the date for the opening of the hearings and adopted a timetable for
them. The Registrar informed the Parties accordingly by letters of 19 Novem-
ber 2002.

15. At the meeting of 6 November 2002, the Agents of the Parties informed
the President of the Court that they had decided not to present witnesses at the
oral proceedings. The Agent of the United States nevertheless expressed his
Government’s intention, under Article 56 of the Rules, to file a new document
containing an analysis and explanations by experts concerning certain evidence
already produced in the case. The Agent of Iran stated that his Government
reserved all its rights with regard to the production of that document. On
20 November 2002, the United States filed an expert’s report dated 18 Novem-
ber 2002, together with a copy of a diplomatic Note dated 20 November 2002
from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington D.C. to the United States
Department of State. By a letter dated 20 January 2003, the Agent of Iran
informed the Court that his Government did not object to the production of
the above-mentioned documents by the United States and requested that, pur-



suant to Article 56, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the comments of an
expert of Iran on the expert report of the United States “be made part of the
record in the case”. On 22 January 2003, the Court decided to authorize the
production of the above-mentioned documents by the United States and
the submission of the comments by Iran; by letters dated the same day, the
Registrar communicated this decision to the Parties.

16. Pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 2, of its Rules, the Court, having con-
sulted the Parties, decided that copies of the pleadings and documents annexed
would be made accessible to the public on the opening of the oral proceedings
on the merits.

17. Public sittings were held between 17 February and 7 March 2003, at
which the Court heard the oral arguments and replies on the claim of Iran and
on the counter-claim of the United States by:

For Iran: Mr. M. H. Zahedin-Labbaf,
Mr. James R. Crawford,
Mr. D. Momtaz,
Mr. Rodman R. Bundy,
Mr. Alain Pellet,
Mr. S. M. Zeinoddin,
Mr. David S. Sellers,
Mr. Michael Bothe.

Mr. Ronald D. Neubauer,
Mr. John Moore,
Mr. Ronald J. Bettauer,
Mr. Michael J. Mattler,
Mr. Michael J. Matheson,
Mr. Prosper Weil,
Mr. Sean Murphy.

In the course of the hearings, questions were put by Members of the Court
and replies given in writing, pursuant to Article 61, paragraph 4, of the Rules
of Court. Each Party presented written observations on the written replies
received from the other, pursuant to Article 72 of the Rules.

18. In the Application, the following requests were made by Iran:

“On the basis of the foregoing, and while reserving the right to supple-
ment and amend these submissions as appropriate in the course of further
proceedings in the case, the Islamic Republic respectfully requests the
Court to adjudge and declare as follows:

(a) that the Court has jurisdiction under the Treaty of Amity to entertain
the dispute and to rule upon the claims submitted by the Islamic
Republic;

(b) that in attacking and destroying the oil platforms referred to in the
Application on 19 October 1987 and 18 April 1988, the United
States breached its obligations to the Islamic Republic, inter alia,




under Articles I and X (1) of the Treaty of Amity and international
law;

(c) that in adopting a patently hostile and threatening attitude towards

the Islamic Republic that culminated in the attack and destruction of
the Iranian oil platforms, the United States breached the object and
purpose of the Treaty of Amity, including Articles I and X (1), and
international law;

(d) that the United States is under an obligation to make reparations to

the Islamic Republic for the violation of its international legal obli-
gations in an amount to be determined by the Court at a subsequent
stage of the proceedings. The Islamic Republic reserves the right to
introduce and present to the Court in due course a precise evaluation
of the reparations owed by the United States; and

(e) any other remedy the Court may deem appropriate.”

19. In the written proceedings, the following submissions were made by the
Parties:

breached its obligations to Iran, inter alia, under Articles I, IV (1) and
X (1) of the Treaty of Amity and international law, and that the United
States bears responsibility for the attacks; and

That the United States is accordingly under an obligation to make full
reparation to Iran for the violation of its international legal obligations
and the injury thus caused in a form and amount to be determined by
the Court at a subsequent stage of the proceedings. Iran reserves the

Any other remedy the Court may deem appropriate”;

in the “Reply and Defence to Counter-Claim”:

(a) generally, in that the United States has not satisfied the require-
ments of Article XXI of the Treaty of Amity with respect to the
satisfactory diplomatic adjustment of the claim;

(b) in any event, to the extent that it relates to vessels which were not
of United States nationality or whose United States flag was not

tion of Iran’s right to amend these submissions, Iran requests the Court,
rejecting all submissions to the contrary, to adjudge and declare :

That the United States’ counter-claim be dismissed.”

1955 Treaty, and

That the Islamic Republic of Iran is accordingly under an obligation to
make full reparation to the United States for violating the 1955 Treaty
in a form and amount to be determined by the Court at a subsequent

make full reparation to the United States for its breach of the 1955
Treaty in a form and amount to be determined by the Court at a sub-
sequent stage of the proceeding.

The United States reserves the right to introduce and present to the

Court in due course a precise evaluation of the reparation owed by Iran.”

20. At the oral proceedings, the following final submissions were presented
by the Parties:

On behalf of the Government of Iran,
at the hearing of 3 March 2003, on the claim of Iran:

“The Islamic Republic of Iran respectfully requests the Court, rejecting

all contrary claims and submissions, to adjudge and declare:



1. That in attacking and destroying on 19 October 1987 and 18 April 1988
the oil platforms referred to in Iran’s Application, the United States
breached its obligations to Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of the
Treaty of Amity, and that the United States bears responsibility for the
attacks; and

2. That the United States is accordingly under an obligation to make full
reparation to Iran for the violation of its international legal obligations
and the injury thus caused in a form and amount to be determined by
the Court at a subsequent stage of the proceedings, the right being
reserved to Iran to introduce and present to the Court in due course a
precise evaluation of the reparation owed by the United States; and

3. Any other remedy the Court may deem appropriate”;

at the hearing of 7 March 2003, on the counter-claim of the United States:

“The Islamic Republic of Iran respectfully requests the Court, rejecting
all contrary claims and submissions, to adjudge and declare:

That the United States counter-claim be dismissed.”

On behalf of the Government of the United States,

at the hearing of 5 March 2003, on the claim of Iran and the counter-claim of
the United States:

“The United States respectfully requests that the Court adjudge and
declare:

(1) that the United States did not breach its obligations to the Islamic
Republic of Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty
between the United States and Iran; and

(2) that the claims of the Islamic Republic of Iran are accordingly dis-
missed.

With respect to its counter-claim, the United States requests that the
Court adjudge and declare:

(1) rejecting all submissions to the contrary, that, in attacking vessels in
the Gulf with mines and missiles and otherwise engaging in military
actions that were dangerous and detrimental to commerce and naviga-
tion between the territories of the United States and the Islamic
Republic of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran breached its obligations
to the United States under Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty;
and

(2) that the Islamic Republic of Iran is accordingly under an obligation to
make full reparation to the United States for its breach of the
1955 Treaty in a form and amount to be determined by the Court at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings.”

21. The task of the Court in the present proceedings is to determine
whether or not there have been breaches of the 1955 Treaty, and if it
finds that such is the case, to draw the appropriate consequences accord-
ing to the submissions of the Parties. The Court is seised both of a claim
by Iran alleging breaches by the United States, and of a counter-claim by



the United States alleging breaches by Iran. Its jurisdiction to entertain
both the claim and the counter-claim is asserted to be based upon
Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty.

22. The Court recalls that, as regards the claim of Iran, the question of
jurisdiction has been the subject of a judgment, given on 12 December
1996, whereby the Court found “that it has jurisdiction, on the basis of
Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty, to entertain the claims
made by the Islamic Republic of Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of
that Treaty” (Z.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 821, para. 55 (2)); certain ques-
tions have however been raised between the Parties as to the precise sig-
nificance or scope of that Judgment, which will be examined below.

As to the counter-claim, the Court also recalls that it decided by an
Order made on 10 March 1998 to admit the counter-claim, and indicated
in that Order that the facts alleged and relied on by the United States
“are capable of falling within the scope of Article X, paragraph 1, of the
1955 Treaty as interpreted by the Court”, and accordingly that “the
Court has jurisdiction to entertain the United States counter-claim in so
far as the facts alleged may have prejudiced the freedoms guaranteed by
Article X, paragraph 1” (I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 204, para. 36). In this
respect also questions have been raised between the Parties as to the
significance and scope of that ruling on jurisdiction, and these will be
examined below.

It is however established, by the decisions cited, that both Iran’s claim
and the counter-claim of the United States can be upheld only so far as a
breach or breaches of Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty may be
shown, even though other provisions of the Treaty may be relevant to the
interpretation of that paragraph. Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955
Treaty reads as follows: “Between the territories of the two High Con-
tracting Parties there shall be freedom of commerce and navigation.”

23. Before proceeding further, it will be convenient to set out the
factual background to the case, as it emerges from the pleadings of both
Parties; the broad lines of this background are not disputed, being a
matter of historical record. The actions giving rise to both the claim and
the counter-claim occurred in the context of the general events that took
place in the Persian Gulf between 1980 and 1988, in particular the armed
conflict that opposed Iran and Iraq. That conflict began on 22 September
1980, when Iraqi forces advanced into the western areas of Iranian terri-
tory, and continued until the belligerent parties accepted a ceasefire in the
summer of 1988, pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolu-
tion 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987. During the war, combat occurred in the
territories of both States, but the conflict also spread to the Persian Gulf
— which is an international commercial route and line of communication
of major importance — and affected commerce and navigation in the
region. From the very beginning of the conflict, on 22 September 1980,
Iran established a defence exclusion zone around its coasts; shortly after,
in early October 1980, Iraq declared a “prohibited war zone” and later



established a “naval total exclusive zone” in the northern area of the Per-
sian Gulf. In 1984, Iraq commenced attacks against ships in the Persian
Gulf, notably tankers carrying Iranian oil. These were the first incidents
of what later became known as the “Tanker War”: in the period between
1984 and 1988, a number of commercial vessels and warships of various
nationalities, including neutral vessels, were attacked by aircraft, heli-
copters, missiles or warships, or struck mines in the waters of the Persian
Gulf. Naval forces of both belligerent parties were operating in
the region, but Iran has denied responsibility for any actions other
than incidents involving vessels refusing a proper request for stop and
search. The United States attributes responsibility for certain incidents
to Iran, whereas Iran suggests that Iraq was responsible for them.

24. A number of States took measures at the time aimed at ensuring
the security of their vessels navigating in the Persian Gulf. In late 1986
and early 1987, the Government of Kuwait expressed its preoccupation
at Iran’s alleged targeting of its merchant vessels navigating in the Per-
sian Gulf. It therefore requested the United States, the United Kingdom
and the Soviet Union to “reflag” some of these vessels to ensure their
protection. Following this request, the Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Company was
able to charter a number of Soviet vessels, and to flag four ships under
United Kingdom registry and 11 ships under United States registry. In
addition, the Government of the United States agreed to provide all
United States-flagged vessels with a naval escort when transiting the Per-
sian Gulf, in order to deter further attacks; these escort missions were
initiated in July 1987, under the designation “Operation Earnest Will”.
Other foreign Powers, including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom, took parallel action, sending warships to the
region to protect international shipping. Despite these efforts, a number
of ships, including reflagged Kuwaiti vessels, merchant tankers carrying
Kuwaiti oil and warships participating in “Operation Earnest Will”,
suffered attacks or struck mines in the Persian Gulf between 1987 and
the end of the conflict.

25. Two specific attacks on shipping are of particular relevance in this
case. On 16 October 1987, the Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City, reflagged to
the United States, was hit by a missile near Kuwait harbour. The United
States attributed this attack to Iran, and three days later, on 19 October
1987, it attacked Iranian offshore oil production installations, claiming
to be acting in self-defence. United States naval forces launched an attack
against the Reshadat [“Rostam”] and Resalat [“Rakhsh”] complexes; the
R-7 and R-4 platforms belonging to the Reshadat complex were destroyed
in the attack. On 14 April 1988, the warship USS Samuel B. Roberts
struck a mine in international waters near Bahrain while returning from



an escort mission; four days later the United States, again asserting the
right of self-defence, employed its naval forces to attack and destroy
simultaneously the Nasr [“Sirri”] and Salman [“Sassan”] complexes.

26. These attacks by United States forces on the Iranian oil platforms
are claimed by Iran to constitute breaches of the 1955 Treaty; and the
attacks on the Sea Isle City and the USS Samuel B. Roberts were
invoked in support of the United States’ claim to act in self-defence. The
counter-claim of the United States is however not limited to those attacks;
according to the United States, Iran was in breach of its obligations
under Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty, “in attacking vessels in
the Gulf with mines and missiles and otherwise engaging in military
actions that were dangerous and detrimental to commerce and naviga-
tion between the territories of the United States and the Islamic Republic
of Iran”. According to the United States, Iran conducted an aggressive
policy and was responsible for more than 200 attacks against neutral
shipping in international waters and the territorial seas of Persian Gulf
States. Iran denies responsibility for those attacks, suggesting that they
were committed by Iraq and drawing attention to Iraq’s interest in inter-
nationalizing the conflict. Furthermore, Iran claims that the attitude of
the Iranian authorities and the measures taken by its naval forces in the
Persian Gulf were solely defensive in nature. It has emphasized that Iraq
was the aggressor State in the conflict, and has claimed that Iraq received
diplomatic, political, economic and military support from a number of
third countries that were not formally parties to the conflict, including
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United States.

27. The Court will first consider a contention to which the United
States appears to have attributed a certain preliminary character. The
United States asks the Court to dismiss Iran’s claim and refuse it the
relief it seeks, because of Iran’s allegedly unlawful conduct, i.e., its viola-
tion of the 1955 Treaty and other rules of international law relating to the
use of force. The United States invokes what it suggests are three related
principles in support of this request. First, a party that acts improperly
with respect to the subject-matter of a dispute is not entitled to relief;
according to the United States, Iran had committed, at the time of the
actions against the platforms, manifestly illegal armed attacks on United
States and other neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf, and it has mis-
represented, in the present proceedings, the facts of the case before the
Court. Second, a party that has itself violated obligations identical to
those that are the basis for its application is not entitled to relief and Iran
had allegedly infringed itself the “mutual and reciprocal” obligations
arising from the 1955 Treaty. Third, an applicant is not entitled to relief
when the actions it complains of were the result of its own wrongful con-



duct. Thus the United States claims that the attacks on the platforms
were a consequence of Iran’s previous wrongful behaviour in the Persian
Gulf.

28. Iran responds that the concept of “clean hands” underlying these
arguments of the United States, “while reflecting and incorporating fun-
damental principles of law inspired by good faith, is not an autonomous
legal institution”. It contends that the concept of “clean hands” requires
the operation of other institutions or legal rules for its implementation.
Iran argues that the “plaintiff’s own wrongful conduct” as a ground for
inadmissibility of a claim relates to claims arising in the context of dip-
lomatic protection and concerns only a foreign individual’s “clean hands”,
but that such a principle is irrelevant in direct State-to-State claims.
According to Iran, as far as State-to-State claims are concerned, such

12 December 1996 on the preliminary objection of the United States to
jurisdiction. In that pleading those issues were dealt with at the end, after
the United States had set out its arguments on the merits, and not by way
of a preliminary issue. In subsequent pleadings and in oral argument it
has presented them as having rather a preliminary character, but it has
nevertheless not gone so far as to suggest that they are issues of admis-
sibility, appropriate to be enquired into before any examination of the
merits. Objections to admissibility normally take the form of an assertion
that, even if the Court has jurisdiction and the facts stated by the appli-
cant State are assumed to be correct, nonetheless there are reasons why
the Court should not proceed to an examination of the merits. That is
not the case here. The United States does not ask the Court to find Iran’s
claim inadmissible; it asks the Court to dismiss that claim. It does not
argue that the Court should be debarred from examining the merits of
the Iranian claim on the grounds of Iran’s conduct; rather it argues that
Iran’s conduct is such that it “precludes it from any right to the relief it
seeks from this Court”, or that it “should not be permitted to recover on
its claim”. The United States invites the Court to make a finding “that
the United States measures against the platforms were the consequence
of Iran’s own unlawful uses of force” and submits that the “appropriate
legal consequences should be attached to that finding”. The Court notes
that in order to make that finding it would have to examine Iranian and
United States actions in the Persian Gulf during the relevant period —
which it has also to do in order to rule on the Iranian claim and the
United States counter-claim.



30. At this stage of its judgment, therefore, the Court does not need to
deal with the request of the United States to dismiss Iran’s claim and
refuse the relief that it seeks on the basis of the conduct attributed to
Iran. The Court will now proceed to the consideration of the claims made
by Iran and the defences put forward by the United States.

31. As noted above (paragraph 21), the dispute in the present case has
been brought before the Court on the jurisdictional basis of Article XXI,
paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty, which provides that

“Any dispute between the High Contracting Parties as to the
interpretation or application of the present Treaty, not satisfactorily
adjusted by diplomacy, shall be submitted to the International Court
of Justice, unless the High Contracting Parties agree to settlement by
some other pacific means.”

By its Judgment of 12 December 1996, the Court found that it had juris-
diction, on the basis of this Article, “to entertain the claims made by the
Islamic Republic of Iran under Article X, paragraph 1, of that Treaty”
(I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 821, para. 55 (2)), which provides, as noted
above (paragraph 22), that “Between the territories of the two High Con-
tracting Parties there shall be freedom of commerce and navigation.” In
the reasoning of that Judgment, the Court indicated that another Article
of the Treaty relied on by Iran, Article IV (which relates to reciprocal
treatment of nationals and companies of each party), could not “form the
basis of the Court’s jurisdiction” (ibid., p. 816, para. 36). It found further
that Article I of the Treaty, which provides that “There shall be firm and
enduring peace and sincere friendship between the United States of
America and Iran”, while being “such as to throw light on the interpreta-
tion of the other Treaty provisions” and “thus not without legal signifi-
cance for such an interpretation, . . . cannot, taken in isolation, be a basis
for the jurisdiction of the Court” (ibid., p. 815, para. 31). The task of the
Court is thus to ascertain whether there has been a breach by the United
States of the provisions of Article X, paragraph 1; other provisions of the
Treaty are only relevant in so far as they may affect the interpretation or
application of that text.

32. In that respect, the Court notes that the United States has relied on
Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), of the Treaty as determinative of the ques-
tion of the existence of a breach of its obligations under Article X. That
paragraph provides that

“The present Treaty shall not preclude the application of meas-
ures:



(d) necessary to fulfil the obligations of a High Contracting Party
for the maintenance or restoration of international peace and
security, or necessary to protect its essential security interests.”

It is the contention of the United States that the actions complained of by
Iran were measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of
the United States, and that accordingly, if those actions would otherwise
have been breaches of Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty, which the
United States denies, the effect of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), is that
they are justified under the terms of the Treaty itself, and thus do not
constitute breaches of it.

33. In its Judgment on the United States preliminary objection of
12 December 1996, the Court ruled that Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), does
not afford an objection to admissibility, but “is confined to affording
the Parties a possible defence on the merits” (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II),
p. 811, para. 20). In accordance with Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the
Treaty, it is now for the Court to interpret and apply that subparagraph,
inasmuch as such a defence is asserted by the United States.

34. As was noted in that Judgment, the Court has had occasion, in the
case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nica-
ragua ( Nicaragua v. United States of America), to examine a provision
in another treaty concluded by the United States, of which the text
is substantially identical to that of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d). This
was Article XXI, paragraph 1 (d), of the 1956 Treaty of Friendship,
Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua.
In its decision in that case, the Court observed that since that provision

“contains a power for each of the parties to derogate from the other
provisions of the Treaty, the possibility of invoking the clauses of
that Article must be considered once it is apparent that certain forms
of conduct by the United States would otherwise be in conflict with
the relevant provisions of the Treaty” (I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 117,
para. 225).

If in the present case the Court is satisfied by the argument of the
United States that the actions against the oil platforms were, in the
circumstances of the case, “measures . . . necessary to protect [the]
essential security interests” of the United States, within the meaning
of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), of the 1955 Treaty, it must hold that
no breach of Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty has been established.

35. To uphold the claim of Iran, the Court must be satisfied both that
the actions of the United States, complained of by Iran, infringed the



freedom of commerce between the territories of the Parties guaranteed by
Article X, paragraph 1, and that such actions were not justified to protect
the essential security interests of the United States as contemplated by
Article XX, paragraph 1 (d). The question however arises in what order
the Court should examine these questions of interpretation and appli-
cation of the Treaty. In the case concerning Military and Paramilitary
Activities in and against Nicaragua, the Court first examined the question
whether the United States conduct constituted a prima facie breach of
other provisions of the Treaty; it concluded that the United States had
“committed acts which are in contradiction with the terms of the Treaty”,
but added that this was “subject to the question whether the exceptions in
Article XX1” of the 1956 Treaty, concerning inter alia protection of the
essential security interests of a party, “may be invoked to justify the acts
complained of” (I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 140, para. 280). The Court thus
dealt first with the substantive provisions of the 1956 Treaty, breaches of
which had been alleged, before turning to Article XXI of the Treaty; in
effect, it analysed that Article as providing for “exceptions” to the sub-
stantive obligations provided for in other Articles of the Treaty (see ibid. ,
p. 116, para. 222).

36. In the present case the United States has argued that Article XX,
paragraph 1 (d), of the 1955 Treaty is not a limitation on Article X,
paragraph 1, nor yet a derogation from it; and that it is a substantive
provision that determines, defines and delimits the obligations of the
parties, simultaneously with and on the same level as Article X, para-
graph 1. The United States therefore contends that there is no compelling
reason to examine the question of breach of Article X, paragraph 1,
before turning to Article XX, paragraph 1 (d); the Court can, it
suggests, dismiss the Iranian claim either on the ground that the actions of
the United States did not involve a breach of Article X, paragraph 1, or
on the ground that those actions were measures necessary to protect the
essential security interests of the United States, and therefore justified
under Article XX, paragraph 1 (d). On this basis, the United States
suggests, the order in which the issues are treated is a matter for the
discretion of the Court.

37. The Court does not consider that the order in which the Articles of
the 1956 Treaty were dealt with in the case concerning Military and
Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua was dictated by the
economy of the Treaty; it was rather an instance of the Court’s “freedom
to select the ground upon which it will base its judgment” (Application of
the Convention of 1902 Governing the Guardianship of Infants, Judgment,
1.C.J. Reports 1958, p. 62). In the present case, it appears to the Court
that there are particular considerations militating in favour of an exami-
nation of the application of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), before turning
to Article X, paragraph 1. It is clear that the original dispute between the
Parties related to the legality of the actions of the United States, in the



light of international law on the use of force. At the time of those actions,
neither Party made any mention of the 1955 Treaty. The contention of
the United States at the time was that its attacks on the oil platforms
were justified as acts of self-defence, in response to what it regarded as
armed attacks by Iran, and on that basis it gave notice of its action to the
Security Council under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Before
the Court, it has continued to maintain that it was justified in acting as
it did in exercise of the right of self-defence; it contends that, even if
the Court were to find that its actions do not fall within the scope of
Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), those actions were not wrongful since they
were necessary and appropriate actions in self-defence.

38. Furthermore, as the United States itself recognizes in its Rejoin-
der, “The self-defense issues presented in this case raise matters of the
highest importance to all members of the international community”, and
both Parties are agreed as to the importance of the implications of the
case in the field of the use of force, even though they draw opposite con-
clusions from this observation. The Court therefore considers that, to the
extent that its jurisdiction under Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955
Treaty authorizes it to examine and rule on such issues, it should do so.

39. The question of the relationship between self-defence and Ar-
ticle XX, paragraph 1 (d), of the Treaty has been disputed between the
Parties, in particular as regards the jurisdiction of the Court. The United
States emphasizes that the Court’s jurisdiction in this case is limited, pur-
suant to Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty, to the interpreta-
tion and application of that Treaty, and does not extend directly to the
determination of the legality of any action of either Party under general
international law. It has contended that

“the Court need not address the question of self-defence . . . [T]he
scope of the exemption provided by Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), is
not limited to those actions that would also meet the standards for
self-defence under customary international law and the United
Nations Charter.”

It however does not contend that the Treaty exempts it, as between the
parties, from the obligations of international law on the use of force, but
simply that where a party justifies certain action on the basis of
Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), that action has to be tested solely against
the criteria of that Article, and the jurisdiction conferred on the Court
by Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the Treaty goes no further than that.

40. In the view of the Court, the matter is one of interpretation of the
Treaty, and in particular of Article XX, paragraph 1 (d). The question is
whether the parties to the 1955 Treaty, when providing therein that it
should “not preclude the application of measures . . . necessary to protect



[the] essential security interests” of either party, intended that such should
be the effect of the Treaty even where those measures involved a use of
armed force; and if so, whether they contemplated, or assumed, a limi-
tation that such use would have to comply with the conditions laid down
by international law. In the case concerning Military and Paramilitary
Activities in and against Nicaragua the Court took the view that “action
taken in self-defence, individual or collective, might be considered as part
of the wider category of measures qualified in Article XXI” — the text in
that case corresponding to Article XX of the 1955 Treaty — “as ‘neces-
sary to protect’ the ‘essential security interests’ of a party” (I. C.J. Reports
1986, p. 117, para. 224); and it cited an extract from the proceedings of
the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee tending to show
that such had been the intentions of the Parties (ibid. ). This approach is
consistent with the view that, when Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), is
invoked to justify actions involving the use of armed force, allegedly in
self-defence, the interpretation and application of that Article will neces-
sarily entail an assessment of the conditions of legitimate self-defence
under international law.

41. It should not be overlooked that Article I of the 1955 Treaty,
quoted in paragraph 31 above, declares that “There shall be firm and
enduring peace and sincere friendship between the United States of
America and Iran.” The Court found in 1996 that this Article “is such as
to throw light on the interpretation of the other Treaty provisions”
(Z.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 815, para. 31). It is hardly consistent with
Article I to interpret Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), to the effect that the
“measures” there contemplated could include even an unlawful use of
force by one party against the other. Moreover, under the general rules of
treaty interpretation, as reflected in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, interpretation must take into account “any relevant
rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”
(Art. 31, para. 3 (c)). The Court cannot accept that Article XX, para-
graph 1 (d), of the 1955 Treaty was intended to operate wholly inde-
pendently of the relevant rules of international law on the use of force, so
as to be capable of being successfully invoked, even in the limited context
of a claim for breach of the Treaty, in relation to an unlawful use of
force. The application of the relevant rules of international law relating
to this question thus forms an integral part of the task of interpretation
entrusted to the Court by Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty.
