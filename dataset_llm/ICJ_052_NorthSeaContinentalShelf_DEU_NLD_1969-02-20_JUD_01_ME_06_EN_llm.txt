Since the Court was called upon, under the Special Agreements by
the notification of which it was seised, to state the principles and rules
applicable to the disputes between the Federal Republic of Germany
and the Kingdoms of Denmark and the Netherlands as to the delimita-
tion of the areas of the continental shelf which makes up the whole of
the North Sea which appertain to each of these countries, the Court had
to establish in the first place the actual concept of the continental shelf
the delimitation of which was in issue.

In fact the Court, not having faced the question directly as I have
suggested, has been unable to avoid discussing a number of its aspects,
and coming back to the point throughout its reasoning. The Court has
in fact had to consider, with a view to the delimitation which is the
subject of the present cases, whether the continental shelf is the natural
prolongation of national territory under the sea, thus justifying the
delimitation of the areas naturally appertaining to each of the coastal
States and excluding the contention for a sharing out among such States;
or whether it is dependent on the idea of contiguity, of which the corollary
would be the equidistance rule, to be compulsorily applied to the delimi-
tation in question ‘; or whether again delimitation on the equidistance
basis 1s inherent in the concept of the continental shelf, or follows
implicitly from the exclusive nature of the rights recognized as belonging
to the coastal States !.

Finally it was not without interest to ascertain whether the continental
shelf has acquired the status of a rule of law by virtue of the said Con-
vention, or as a result of custom, since its legal régime could differ
according to which was the case.

All these are questions which should have been dealt with, in my
opinion, from the very beginning, in order to clarify the reasoning and
so as to leave no lurking uncertainty as to the scope and significance of
the Judgment.

2. Atallevents there was no ground for accepting the opinion expressed
by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that the Court is not invited to
pronounce on the question of what part of the bed of the sea and of
the subsoil of the high seas should be considered, from the legal point
of view, as constituting the continental shelf. It must be borne in mind
that the integrity of the high seas, the freedom of which is hallowed by
a general custom, is in issue, and all States, not merely the Parties to
the disputes. are directly interested therein.

It goes without saying that the Court is bound by the Special Agree-
ments just as much as the Parties. The quotations taken fiom the Judg-
ments concerning the cases of the Lotus and of the Territorial Jurisdiction
of the International Commission of the River Oder are relevant in this
connection. It is nonetheless the case that the Court has the right, when
appropriate, to interpret the special agreement by which it has become
seised of a case, as it has to interpret any convention, following a settled
line of decisions. And however restrictive such interpretation should
be—in view of the sovereignty of States and the optional nature of the
Court's jurisdiction-—it is nonetheless abundantly clear that the Parties
could not have asked the Court to state principles and rules which could
have no application in law. A convention cannot be isolated from its
legal context. which in the present case is the problem of the continental

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 102

shell. If, for the sake of argument, this were not recognized in law,
there could be no dispute as to its delimitation, and in the absence of a
dispute there would be no reason to define principles and rules to resolve
it. It is appropriate to recall the rule of interpretation stated by this
Court in its Advisory Opinion of 3 March 1950 on the subject of the
Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the
United Nations, to the effect that the text should be recognized as authori-
tative, unless its terms are ambiguous or lead to an unreasonable result;
for it would not be reasonable to abide closely by the letter of the Special
Agreements and not to elucidate the whole tenor thereof or any implicit
elements.

3. When this has been said, the question with which the Court was
faced first of all was whether there exists a general international con-
vention, within the meaning of Article 38, paragraph 1 (a), of its Statute,
which has modified the principle of the freedom of the high seas and
sanctioned the concept of the continental shelf.

It should be sufficient to observe that the Geneva Convention of
29 April 1958 on the Continental Shelf has up to the present been
ratified by only 39 States, out of a total of about 140 making up the
international community. The Convention remains, by analogy with
internal law of the nations, res inter alios acta, and could not bring
about a modification erga omnes of the principle of the high seas, or
limit the scope o1 legal consequences thereof. This interpretation, it
should be added, indisputably applies to norm-creating treaties as well
as to contract-treaties, particularly since the falling into disuse of the
privilege which a limited number of Powers used to claim to legislate
in the name of all the nations of the world, whether colonized o1 in-
dependent.

It is true that, in order to claim sovereign or exclusive rights over the
continental shelf bordering on their respective territorial seas, the Parties
rely on the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Convention on the
Continental Shelf mentioned above. The Kingdom of the Netherlands
and the Kingdom of Denmark are obviously bound by the stipulations
of that Convention. The Federal Republic of Germany, which has not
ratified it, is nonetheless bound, by virtue of the principle of good faith
in international relations, as is every State as a result of a unilateral
declaration !, by the statements made in the Memorial, affirmed in the
course of the speeches of 4 November 1968, in which the Federal Republic
declared that the definition of the continental shelf and the rights of the
coastal States as determined by Articles ! and 2 before referred to are
generally recognized: it explained that it ‘recognizes that the submarine

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 103

areas of the North Sea constitute a continental shelf over which the
coastal States are entitled to exercise the rights defined in Article 2 of
the Convention I".

Although the Parties to the case arc bound, cach with regard to the
other. by the obligations which they have assumed in the ways which
have been mentioned, it is nonetheless the case that the definition and
the rights mentioned above cannot be relied on, solely on the ground of
the Convention mentioned above, as against States which have not
ratified it, or have not declared that they accept its terms.

Consequently the affirmation is justified that the freedom of the high
seas, settled by virtue of a custom of international law which is universally
accepted, should be respected in principle and as to its consequences,
and. in the absence of a convention of universal scope cannot be modified
or limited except by a custom backed by a general consensus, or in the
last analysis by a general principle of law.

It is now as well to enquire whether a modification of the principle
of the freedom of the high seas has not in fact taken place by virtue of
a new customary rule of universal scope. This will be the subject of the
following question.

Whereas the Geneva Convention of 29 April 1958 on the High Seas
codifies certain rules of customary international law, and in particular
the freedom of the high seas outside territorial waters, the question
arises whether this is also the case with the Geneva Convention of the
same date on the Continental Shelf; and if not, has a custom been formed
subsequently which, modifying the custom establishing the freedom of
the high seas, confers exclusive rights over stretches of these or over
certain of their component parts?

It should of course be observed that the Convention on the High Seas
mentions, in its preamble, the intention of the parties to “codify the
rules of international law relating to the high seas”; whereas the Con-
vention on the Continental Shelf says nothing of that kind. Furthermore,
Article 1 of the latter Convention, when giving a definition of the conti-
nental shelf, limits it to the purposes of the articles of that Convention.
1t would not however be possible to use these considerations as an

! Memorial, para. 8.

argument for stating that the concept of the continental shelf as opposed
to that of the freedom of the high seas, is not yet accepted in customary
international law. Proof of the formation of custom is not to be deduced
from statements in the text of a convention; it is in the practice of
States that it must be sought. Indeed, custom, which Article 38, para-
graph 1 (h), of the Statute of the Court takes as evidence of a general
practice accepted as law, or which the teaching of publicists, following
Gentilis !, interprets rather as a practice capable of demonstrating its
existence, requires the consent, express or tacit, of the generality of
States, as was taught by Grotius with reference to the customary law
of nations of the period. It is therefore a question of enquiring whether
such a practice is observed, not indeed unanimously, but, as is quite
clear from the above-mentioned Article, by the generality of States with
actual consciousness of submitting themselves to a legal obligation.

5. The facts which constitute the custom in question are to be found
in a series of acts, internal or international, showing an intention to
adapt the law of nations to social and economic evolution and to the
progress of knowledge; this evolution and this progress have given
impetus to the exploitation of the riches of the soil and subsoil of the
sea at ever-increasing depths, and to the use of new means of communi-
cation and transport which develop unceasingly, and to the extension,
sometimes ill-considered, of deep-sea fishing, which has its dangers for
the conservation of marine species and, in general, of the biological
resources which have become more and more necessary for the feeding
of rapidly growing populations.

6. Not so long ago, an eminent jurist ! could still write that the pro-
clamations of States do not constitute more than a recital of facts in
which it is difficult to “trace an ethic widely accepted as constituting
law, that is to say, embodying a concept of general interest or of equity.
He saw therein rather the contrary, discerning, of course, “in the back-
ground, pretexts or anxieties as to the needs of humanity”, but consider-
ing as by far the most dominant ‘’a concern for individual interests and,
at the most, for national interest, which in the law of nations is no more
than an individual interest”.

The 1epresentatives of certain countries echoed this doctrinal peint of
view at the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958 ?.

And in fact, up to the eve of that Conference, it could be claimed that
the doctrine of the continental shelf was still no more than a custom in
the process of formation.

Today it must be admitted that these encroachments on the high seas,
these derogations from the freedom thereof, beginning with the Truman
Proclamation of 28 September 1945, are the expression of new needs of
humanity. From this it may be deduced that just as reasons of an economic
nature concerning navigation and fishing justified the freedom of the
high seas, reasons of the same nature which are no less imperative,
concerning the production of new resources with a rich future, and their
conservation and their equitable division between nations, may hence-
forward justify the limitation of that freedom. Thus the American Pro-

This aggregate body of elements, including the legal positions taken
up by the representatives of the majority of the countries at the Geneva
Conference, even by those who expressed reservations !, amounts here
and now to a general consensus constituting an international custom
sanctioning the concept of the continental shelf, which permits the Parties
to lay claim to delimitation between them of the areas of the North Sea
continental shelf appertaining to them, for the exercise of exclusive rights
of exploration and exploitation of the natural resources secreted in the
bed and subsoil of the sea.

7. 1f the concept of the continental shelf has thus been definitively
recognized, there remains a related question, namely the extent of the
continental shelf or its outer limit. This is a question which is subject
to controversy, and which caused the representative of the Federal
Republic of Germany to say: “a crucial question has not yet been settled
—what are the outer limits of the continental shelf towards the open
sea 47”

The interest of the question lics in the fact that a judgment stating the
principles and rules applicable to the delimitation of the continental
shelf should not allow it to be understood that the Court has accepted,
without examination, the concept of the continental shelf.

It is possible to enquire whether the delimitation of the continental
shelf appearing in Article 1 of the Convention has alone passed into
customary law, or whether the latter does not imply—as in the case of
historic waters-—other outer limits of the area of the high seas subjected
to the jurisdiction of the coastal State under the title of continental
shelf or of epicontinental platform, or under some other denomination.

8. Tt will in fact be observed that some of the acts mentioned above,
forming part of State practice, had remained open to challenge as a
result of the extension which those acts gave to the appropriation of the
high seas. In particular, in the most western hemisphere, such were the
laws, proclamations or decrees issued in 1946 by Argentina, in 1947 by
Peru, Chile and Ecuador, in 1948 by Costa Rica, and in 1950 by Honduras
and El Salvador; these acts extended the bounds of the continental
shelf adjacent to the coasts of these States beyond the break in the
slope occurring at a depth between 130 ard about 550 metres !, or, in
the absence of a submarine prolongation of territory in the form of a
shelf, replaced this with an arca of the high seas, the continental slope
or the epicontinental platform, limited by some of thesc acts to a minimum
of 200 miles from the coast ?, and left by others without any limits
whatever.

It is relevant to stress, in this connection, the guiding role played by
Peru—a country which is almost without a continental shelf —as a result
of the above-mentioned decisions of the United States, Mexico and
Argentina, the last two of which already claimed, in addition to the
continental shelf, exclusive areas of the epicontinental platform. How is
it, it was emphasized in Peru, that the only States which can take advan-
tage of a natural phenomenon which permits them to annex immense
areas of subsoil and of the high scas, can profit from them exclusively,
and can condemn those who are handicapped by geographical configura-
tions to stand idly by in face of the immense riches secreted by their
adjacent waters, and that to the profit of capitalist enterprises better
endowed than their own and powerfully protected *. The immense riches
disputed between the maritime Powers and Peru were the incalculable
piscatory riches secreted by its epicontinental platform, which it was
determined to preserve in order that the production of guano should not
be prejudiced, in the interest of the national economy, which incidentally
coincided with the interest of agricultural production throughout the
world *.

Thus a common declaration by Peru, Chile and Ecuador proceeded
to reinforce this claim in the following terms:

! Geneva Conference, Preparatory documents, Vol. 1, pp. 39-40.

- The 200-mile limit is well within the extreme width of the continental shelf
which in certain regions is as much as 1,300 kilometres.

* Quoted by G. Scelle, op. cit., p. 46.

+ Cf. M. W. Mouton, The Continental Shelf. p. 80, who states as follows: ‘Peru
has an extra reason, because the fish form the food for guano birds, which are an
economic assct to the country.”

The decisions of municipal courts of Peru have confirmed this view: judgment of
the Tribunal of Piata of 26 November 1954, in the case of the ships, Olympic,
Victor and others.


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 108

“Governments are bound to ensure for their peoples access to
necessary food supplies and to furnish them with the means of
developing their economy. It is therefore the duty of each Govern-
ment to ensure the conservation and protection of its natural re-
sources and to regulate the use thereof to the greatest possible
advantage of its country, Hence it is likewise the duty of each
Government to prevent the said resources from being used outside
the area of its jurisdiction so as to endanger their existence, integrity
and conservation to the prejudice of peoples so situated geographi-
cally that their seas are irreplaceable sources of essential food and
economic materials. For the foregoing reasons the Governments of
Chile, Ecuador and Peru, being resolved to preserve for and make
available to their respective peoples the natural resources of the
areas adjacent to their coasts, . . . declare as follows:

Owing to the geological and biological factors affecting the exis-
tence, conservation and development of the marine fauna and flora,
. .. the former extent of the territorial sea and contiguous zone is
insufficient . . . [for] those resources, to which the coastal countries
are entitled ... [They] therefore proclaim as a principle of their
international maritime policy that each of them possesses sole
sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area of sea adjacent to the
coast of its own country and extending not less than 200 nautical
miles from the said coast.

Their sole jurisdiction and sovereignty over the zone thus des-
cribed includes sole sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea floor
and subsoil thereof . . ” English text by the United Nations Secre-
tariat.

In succession, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras adopted this
concept, against which the maritime Powers did not fail to protest !.

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 109

one of a very small extent !. Tt is in fact necessary to consider whether
these statements of position, particularly those of Peru, Chile and Ecua-
dor, were not purely declaratory of an already established custom, and
whether the objections of the maritime Powers were not in consequence
belated.

In any event, the position of these States has been reinforced by two
fresh facts.

In the first place, there is the Italian-Yugoslav Agreement of 8 January
1968 delimiting the whole breadth of the Adriatic Sea between the two
parties 2. It is of course there stated that the delimitation deals with
the continental shelf; but it is unnecessary to concentrate on the wording
when the facts are clear. The depths of the area delimited, on average
about 800 metres, in fact attain 1,589 metres. There is therefore no
question of a continental shelf in the sense of Article 1 of the Geneva
Convention, to which Yugoslavia has acceded, since the delimitation
line is not merely beyond the 200 metres depth line, but also beyond
the depths which, in the present state of technology, permit of the
exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed, and this has not yet
reached 200 metres. It is only exploration that has gone further. It is
with the epicontinental platform, on the model of the countries of Latin
America, that the agreement between Yugoslavia and Italy therefore
deals.

The second fact is the claim by Saudi Arabia over the depths of the
Red Sea, which has just been announced *. The Red Sea had been kept

for exploitation on the high seas which he lists as follows: “The U.S. has issued
phosphate leases some 40 miles from the California coast in the Forty-Mile Bank

9. A few extracts from the most outstanding statements made in the
course of the Geneva Conference are appropriate to illustrate the problem
with which we are dealing.

El Salvador, adopting a legal standpoint, accepted “‘the rights of the
coastal State, not only over the continental shelf, but also over an ex-
clusive fishing zone, and its rights to regulate the conservation of natural
resources in zones of the high seas adjacent to that exclusive fishing zone,
in the conviction that that view constituted recognition of the legal unity
of different aspects of the law of the sea "””,

Ghana intervened in turn to raise the question of the economic and
social interests of certain smaller States, including its own, a young coun-
try, which possessed a very narrow continental shelf as a result of a sharp
drop of the seabed near the coast, and which depended almost exclusively
on fisheries for its protein supply. The definition adopted by the Con-
ference, it concluded, “might operate to the disadvantage of those coun-
tries 2°. It was observed at the same Conference that the Ivory Coast
is in an almost identical situation. The cry of alarm by Ghana, on behalf
of the smaller countries, remains as witness to a disturbing reality.

The United Arab Republic proposed a fixed limit, whatever the depth
of the sea, in order that ‘consideration should be given to the desire of
countries without a continental shelf 3". Norway suggested that the limit
should be based, not on the configuration of the seabed or the depth of
the water, but on distance from the coast. Such a solution, “in the light
of the principle of State equality, would be fairer **. Guatemala thought
it advisable to “provide for a new concept, which might perhaps be termed
the ‘continental terrace’, comprising an area bounded by a line drawn
at a given distance from the baseline of the territorial sea of the coastal
State® ”. Yugoslavia made a formal proposal for a limit situated 100 miles

from the coast, ie. half that adopted by Peru, Chile and Ecuador, in
order to avoid recourse to a double criterion, the 200-metres depth cri-
terion and that of the possibility of exploitation !.

The opinion of Panama was that “the term ‘continental base’ would
be more accurate than ‘continental shelf”, for the former referred to the
continental shelf and the continental slope =. Finally the Netherlands
proposed, “in line with statements made by several representatives, in-
cluding the representative of Panama, ... that the whole of the ‘con-
tinental terrace’, which included both the continental shelf proper and
the continental slope. should be covered by the articles °’” of the Con-
vention.

Finally. Chile, Ecuador and Peru made a common declaration con-
firming the one quoted above. In it they stated that ‘In the absence of
international agreement on sufficiently comprehensive and just provisions
recognizing and creating a reasonable balance among all the rights and
interests, and also in view of the results of this Conference, the regional
system applied in the southern Pacific . . . remains in full force” and they
therein affirmed their resolve to assist “in the establishment and extension

10. It seems however that the Geneva Conference took a step in the
direction of an extension of the continental shelf when it stipulated, in
Article 1, that this extends to the 200-metres depth line or, beyond that
limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploita-
tion of the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil.

This fictitious extension of the continental shelf, effected by the Geneva
Convention at the expense of the high seas, weakens the case of those who.
having adopted it, oppose the claims of States which nature has not en-
dowed with a continental shelf and which are able, by a similar fictitious
extension thereof, to find legitimate compensation in the resources of
the waters adjacent to their coasts °.


Inasmuch as the basic motivation of the claims of all concerned is
economic in nature, it is fair that the interests of all States should receive
satisfaction on a basis of equality. Equality in freedom had for centuries
been adopted as a notion peculiar to the law of the sea, before being
definitively extended by the Charter of the United Nations to every
domain of the life of nations and of individuals, thus linking the tradition
with Roman law, which discerned the idea of equality in the concept of
equity !. Should not this idea remain the foundation of the law of the
sea, and of any modification made or to be made to that law: equality
as to the high seas, equality concerning the natural dependencies of the
land, both for the continental shelf and for the epicontinental platform;
consequently, equality in the delimitation of areas of the continental
shelf, which is the question to be resolved in the present proceedings.

as far as, if not further than, the principle of the freedom of the high
seas. This freedom, hallowed by custom in the west since the 7th cen-
tury, was not entirely free from legal limitations. There might be men-
tioned:

(a) Historic waters (gulfs, bays, etc.) such as the Gulf of Fonseca in
Central America, assimilated to internal waters; the Gulf of the
River Plate in Argentina; the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays in
the United States; the Bays of Miramachi, Hudson and Chaleurs
in Canada; the Gulf of Gascony and the Bay of Granville or of
Cancale in France: the Bristol Channel in England; the Bay of Con-
ception in Newfoundland; the Gulf of Manaar and the Bay of Polk
in India: the Gulf of Finland; the Baie du Lévrier in Africa; the
Bays of Tunis and Gabés in Tunisia; the Bay of El Arab on the
Mediterranean coast of the United Arab Republic; the Arabian-
Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aqaba in the Arab seas 2.

(hb) Sedentary fisheries and fisheries with fixed equipment, the customary
rules relating to which were adopted by the Geneva Convention of

* The historic character of the Gulf of Aqaba was disputed in the General
Assembly of the United Nations in February 1957. The United States declared
however that, should the case arise, it would accept the decision of the International
Court of Justice (Memorandum of 11 February 1957 to Israel and Declaration by
Secretary of State Dean Rusk of 5 March 1957). The former states that: ‘In the
absence of some overriding decision to the contrary, as by the International Court
of Justice, the United States, on behalf of vessels of United States registry, is prepared
to exercise the right of free and innocent passage and to join with others to secure
general recognition of this right, and the latter states that: *". . . The United States
view is that the passage should be open unless there is a contrary decision by the
International Court of Justice.”

29 April 1958 on the High Seas. There might be mentioned, as
examples, the fisheries of Ceylon and Bahrain (Arabian-Persian
Gulf), the coral banks in the Mediterranean off the coasts of Algeria,
Sicily and Sardinia, and lastly innumerable fisheries in the Red Sea
and in the seas of the Far East 1,

whereas rights over the continental shelf are considered to be exercised
ipso jure, without the aid of effectiveness.

These States can consequently avail themselves of the adage quiera
non movere 3, and take shelter behind situations consolidated by time *
which have changed into rules of law, no longer admitting for the future
of any possible protests °. The feeling of society, it must be concluded,

! The pearl oyster fisheries of Ceylon and Bahrain had already received the
attention of Vattel (The Law of Nations, 1758). P. C. Jessup (The Law of Territorial
Waters, 1927, p. 15), also recalled that the pearl fisheries of Ceylon go back in
history as far as to the sixth century B.C. Whilst those of the Arabian-Persian Gulf
were, as is well known, mentioned about the year 1000 in the Arabian Nights.

M. W. Mouton was thus able to write: We believe, that prescriptive rights could

the continental shelf without having regard to the parallel or supplemen-
tary concept of the epicontinental platform.

* *

14. Two supplementary questions remain, which should be resolved
in order to give a complete picture of the concept or the legal status of
the continental shelf, satisfying the requirements of the arguments in the
present case:

(a) 1s the continental shelf referable to the concept of contiguity, or
should it be considered rather as a natural submarine prolongation
of the land territory of the coastal State?

(b) Does the continental shelf consist of an extension of territorial
sovereignty, or does it simply confer rights, either sovereign rights
or exclusive rights?

*

! The said Declaration reads: “It is hereby declared that the Argentine epiconti-
nental sea and continental shelf are subject to the sovereign power of the nation.”

? Cf. M. W. Mouton, The Continental Shelf. p. 74.


15. Is the continental shelf referable to the concept of contiguity, or
should it be considered rather as a natural submarine prolongation of the
land territory of the coastal State?

The argument of contiguity put forward in the Counter-Memorials
and in the course of the speeches made by the representatives of Denmark
and the Netherlands, to the effect that the submarine areas nearest to a
State are presumed to appertain to it rather than to another State, is
claimed to follow from the actual definition of the continental shelf given
in Article 1 of the relevant Convention and to be inherent in the idea that
that State possesses ipso jure a title to these areas or exclusive rights over
them, and thus a direct and essential link—in other words, a link that is
inherent and not merely implicit—founded on the ratio legis of the fun-
damental concept of the continental shelf is said to have been established
between that concept and the delimitation rule of Article 6.

This view would not seem to be accepted as a rule of international law,
as is clear, in particular, from the Award dated 23 January 1925 in the
Island of Palmas case. That Award, delivered by one of the three great
Swiss arbitrators, M. Huber, stressed that “‘it is impossible to show the
existence of a rule of positive international law to the effect that islands
situated outside territorial waters should belong to a State from the mere
fact that its territory forms the terra firma (nearest continent or island of
considerable size)”.

This decision, which is generally accepted, also, by analogy, resolves
the case of submarine areas.

The line of argument advanced in the Counter-Memorials is also cate-
gorically refuted by previous judicial decisions inasmuch as, in the inter-
pretation of the texts, it openly violates the natural meaning of the words,
when it maintains that the term “adjacent” which appears in Article 1
of the Convention on the Continental Shelf is the equivalent of the term
“equidistant”, and proceeds to deduce therefrom that the said Article
which defines the continental shelf at the same time determines the rule
by which it is to be delimited, namely the equidistance rule. But if such
had been the intention of the authors of the Convention, they would
have expressed it, instead of allowing it to be deduced in such a laborious
fashion. Further, nothing is to be found in the travaux préparatoires in
support of this opinion, as the Court has shown by referring to the docu-
ments of the International Law Commission and the Committee of Ex-
perts. On the other hand, the use of the term ‘“‘adjacent” is naturally
explained by an intention to confine the continental shelf to a limited
part of the high seas, that part which prolongs the coast, to the exclusion
of the open sea. It would moreover be difficult to accept that, contrary
to good legislative technique, the subtleties and consequences of which
were well known to them, the authors of the Convention used in the same


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 116

sense two absolutely different words. The term “adjacent” refers only
to the fact of the reciprocal situation of two territories or of two neigh-
bouring maritime areas. The term equidistant’, on the contrary, relates
to a measurement to be determined between the two territories or the
two adjacent maritime areas.

Finally, it would not be superfluous to stress the seriousness of the
consequences which the acceptance of this argument would involve.
It would justify territorial or maritime acquisitions repugnant to the
fundamental principles of contemporary international law: for example
the appropriation of large areas of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic
Continent, an appropriation which also relies on the doctrine of sectors,
which doctrine, in certain of its elements, is reminiscent of the abandoned
concept of spheres of influence; for example also, the policy derived
from the Berlin Treaty of 1885, which, having divided up Africa, con-
sidered as res nullius, permitted extension of sovereignty starting from
the coast which had been effectively occupied. And should there not be
added to these examples the doctrine of Lebensraum extending beyond
the bounds of a country?

17. Does the continental shelf consist of an extension of territorial
sovereignty, or does it simply confer rights, either sovereign right or
exclusive rights?

The conduct of States is various and subject to change. Nonetheless
three attitudes may be discerned which correspond to the three possibili-
ties comprised in the last question raised, in order to round off the ques-
tion of the legal status of the continental shelf: a North American attitude
which holds fast to the notion of exclusiveness; a South American attitude
claiming territorial sovereignty; and lastly the Geneva attitude, which
culminated in the Convention sanctioning rights qualified simultaneously
as sovereign and exclusive.

The Truman Proclamation claimed an exclusive right over the con-
tinental shelf, and without claiming to exercise formal sovereignty there-
over, nonetheless affirmed that the American Government regarded the
natural resources of the subsoil and of the seabed and of the continental
shelf, beneath the high seas and contiguous to the coasts of the United
States, as appertaining to it and subject to its jurisdiction and control.

The series of declarations which followed did not all refrain from pro-
claiming the sovereignty of the coastal State over the bed and subsoil of
the high seas. This was the case with the majority of the States of Latin
America which extended their sovereignty for 200 nautical miles over the
epicontinental platform, or beyond.

As for the Geneva Conference, after wavering between the concepts of
exclusive rights and sovereign rights, it opted for the latter in Article 2,
paragraph 1, of the Convention, and in paragraph 2 of the same Article,
it described the sovereign rights as exclusive.

The United States, mentioned above, ranged itself on the side of this
latter concept by ratifying the Convention.

18. Nonetheless, however varied State practice may be, it should be
possible to make it subject to a dual criterion. The rights which coastal
States can exercise over the continental shelf or the epicontinental plat-
form are capable of being determined as a group by the economic objec-
tives given for them, and by the consideration that the freedom of the
high seas should not be affected except to the extent required for the
realization of these objectives. In other words, since it is a question of a
principle of the law of nations from which economic, social and political
development, as well as scientific and technological progress, may bring
about necessary derogations, the rights which the coastal State can exer-
cise over the continental shelf or the epicontinental platform should be
limited to those which can be justified from the standpoint of the realiza-
tion of the ends for which they were instituted, that is to say, generally
speaking, the exclusive exploitation, as against other States, of submarine
resources in the one case, or of fishing in the other.

As to the sovereign character attributed to these rights, it would appear,
in the three situations to which attention has been drawn, to be a case of
a somewhat dismembered territorial sovereignty, of which certain at-
tributes are exercised over the continental shelf or the epicontinental
platform. The legal content of the sovereign rights remains limited to
those acts which are strictly necessary for the exploration, exploitation
or protection of the resources of the continental shelf, to the exclusion of
the waters and of the area lying above them. In the same way, the legal
content of what has been called sovereignty by the States of Latin America
is limited to the objects mentioned above, to which is to be added fishing,
excluding freedom of navigation and the right to lay and maintain cables
and pipelines. There would thus be no question, in any case, of sover-
eignty in the form in which it is exercised over the territorial sea.

20. It will hereinafter be established that the three Parties to the pre-
sent case are bound by the provisions of the aforementioned Article 2

! This reasoning does not seem to be that followed by the Ad Hoc Committee
set up by the United Nations to study the peaceful uses of the seabed and the ocean
floor.

21. The concept of the continental shelf being recognized, together
with the rights exercised thereover, as forming part of customary inter-
national law, the request made of the Court by the Parties involves first
of all the following question:

Does there exist a general or particular convention, within the meaning
of Article 38, paragraph 1 (a), of the Statute of the Court, containing
rules applicable to the delimitation between coastal States of the areas
of the continental shelf of the North Sea which they claim?

*

The Governments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom
of Denmark rely on the provisions of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention
on the Continental Shelf of 29 April 1958 for the delimitation of the
areas of the North Sea continental shelf.

The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which has not
ratified the Convention, has also not recognized the relevant dispositions
of Article 6, relied on by the Governments of the Netherlands and Den-
mark, as it has done in the case of the first two articles of the said Con-
vention !.

The conduct of the Federal Republic and certain declarations made
by it have however been interpreted by the opposing Parties as amounting
to a commitment on its part to submit to the provisions of Article 6 of
the Convention.

The Court, in its study of the effects of the declarations made by or
the conduct of a State, concludes-—"that only the existence of a situation
of estoppel could suffice to lend substance to this contention {sc., that
the Federal Republic of Germany is bound by its declarations]—that is
to say if the Federal Republic were now precluded from denying the ap-
plicability of the conventional régime, by reason of past conduct, de-
clarations, etc., which not only clearly and consistently evinced accep-
tance of that régime but also had caused Denmark or the Netherlands,
in reliance on such conduct, detrimentally to change position or suffer
some prejudice’.

* Supra, para. 3.


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 120

The Judgment does not take into account a well-settled doctrine that
a State may be bound by a unilateral act !.

As a consequence of its argument, the Judgment mentions in para-
graph 31 that—"it seems to the Court that little useful purpose will be
served by passing in review and subjecting to detailed scrutiny the various
acts relied on by Denmark and the Netherlands as being indicative of
the Federal Republic’s acceptance of the régime of Article 6°.

While agreeing with the Judgment that Article 6, as such, is not ap-
plicable to the delimitations envisaged in the present cases, | consider
that the unilateral acts and the conduct of the Federal Republic should
be analysed in order to clinch this conclusion.

+

22. The Federal Government’s delegation announced, as is mentioned
in the minutes of the negotiations with the Netherlands Government
dated 4 August 1964 2, that its Government ‘‘is seeking to bring about a
conference of States adjacent to the North Sea ... in accordance with
the first sentence of paragraph | and the first sentence of paragraph 2
of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf” and
that “the Netherlands delegation has taken note of this intention”. But
this commitment, expressly limited to two provisions of Article 6 con-
cerning the advisability of preferably having recourse to agreements for
the delimitation of the continental shelf, cannot be interpreted as a
declaration referring to the whole of the provisions of that Article.

equidistance rule.

Acquiescence flowing from a unilateral legal act, or inferred from the
conduct or attitude of the person to whom it is to be opposed—either
by application of the concept of estoppel by conduct of Anglo-American
equity, or by virtue of the principle of western law that allegans contraria
non audiendus est, which has its parallel in Muslim law *—is numbered
among the general principles of law accepted by international law as

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 121

forming part of the law of nations, and obeying the rules of interpretation
relating thereto. Thus when the acquiescence alleged is tacit, as it would
be in the present case inasmuch as it is inferred from the conduct of the
party against whom it is relied on, it demands that the intention be
ascertained by the manifestation of a definite expression of will, free of
ambiguity.

But the Federal Government formally declared in the joint minutes
of 4 August 1964, referred to above, that “it must not be concluded from

9 June 1965 and the annexed Protocol of the same date, constitute an
indivisible whole, the Court cannot disassociate therefrom the declara-
tions mentioned above of 4 August 1964 and 9 June 1965 which brought
each set of negotiations to a close, and of which the meaning does not
lend itself to any equivocation, and is such as not to allow any doubt
to subsist as to the intention of the Federal Republic of Germany to
exclude the application of equidistance pure and simple to the delimita-
tion beyond latitude 54 degrees north. There is in fact no reason why,
in the interpretation of unilateral declarations, the settled jurisprudence
of the Court should not be followed, to the effect that the terms of the
treaty should be interpreted “in their natural and ordinary meaning ?”.
It should also be remarked that the German-Danish treaty allegedly
includes only one equidistance point, the terminal of the partial bound-
ary 3.

It would be no less incorrect to say, as a result of similar reasoning
concerning the true intention of the Federal Government, that the latter,
by its Proclamation of 20 January 1964 and the exposé des motifs of the

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 122

we will suppose to be efficacious. the status of a customary law rule
which it does not possess !,

Furthermore, what legal effect should be attributed to the signature
by the Federal Republic of Germany of the Protocol for Provisional
Application of the European Fisheries Convention of 9 March 1964,
Article 7 of which provides for recourse to the median line. every point

exceeding the object for which it was agreed, extend to the continental
shelf? The reply is more than doubtful, because of the express opposition
by the Federal Government to the application of the equidistance line,
in the documents which have successively been discussed, dated 4 August
1964, 9 June 1965, 20 January 1964 and 24 July 1964. Such seems to
be the interpretation to be given to the intention of the Federal Republic.

This being the case, the Court does not have to embark, in addition,
on an enquiry into the private thoughts of the Federal Republic, as the
Netherlands Government calls upon it to do, by asking in its Counter-
Memorial why the Federal Republic stressed, in the minutes of 4 August
1968, that the boundary should be determined with due regard to the
special circumstances prevailing in the mouth of the Ems, if it did not
have in mind the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Geneva Con-
vention, i.c., the equidistance rule.

It is not therefore possible to interpret the treaties of | December 1964
and 9 June 1965, between the Federal Republic on the one side, and the
Netherlands and Denmark on the other, in the light of the minutes of
4 August 1964 and the Protocol of 9 June 1965, nor the declaration of
the Federal Government of 20 January 1964 and the exposé des motifs
of the law of 24 July of the same year, as an acquiescence in the applica-
tion of the equidistance line as contemplated in the Convention of
29 April 1958 on the Continental Shelf.

+
* *


The Kingdoms of Denmark and of the Netherlands have contended
that having fixed the boundaries of their parts of the continental shelf
on the specific basis of the principles and rules of law generally recognized,
those boundaries are not prima facie contrary to international law and
are valid as against other States. They base their contention on the
provisions of Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention on the
Continental Shelf, according to which, in the absence of agreement, and
unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the
boundary is to be determined by application of the principle of equidis-
tance from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea
of the adjacent States in measured.

The unilateral action on which the Danish and Netherlands Govern-
ments rely would have been opposable to other States and consequently


As has been seen, Articles | and 2 of the said Convention, which
establish the institution of the continental shelf, were not the result of
a codification of the international law in force, forming part of the
lex lata, but the effect of the progressive development of the law, de lege
ferenda, referred to in Article 13 of the Charter of the United Nations
and Article 15 of the Statute of the International Law Commission.
The case of the provisions of Article 6, paragraph 2, could not be different,
inasmuch as they apply the principle laid down in Articles 1 and 2.

Has this progressive development of the law reached the stage, in
respect of what is stated in paragraph 2 of Article 6, of settled custom,
since the adoption of the equidistance method by the International Law
Commission in 1953, and subsequently by the Geneva Conference in
1958, in both cases by a very large majority?

Admittedly. the notion of the continental shelf itself, which made its
first appearance in State practice in 1945, took only a dozen years to


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 124

become a universally recognized custom. The voices of authoritative
writers ! and jurists of all kinds, at international conferences, were unable
to stem the current of legal thinking resulting from unprecedented
scientific progress and the rapid development of the economic and social
life of the nations. That is to say that this recent rule of the law of the
sea, under the pressure of powerful motives and thanks to State practice
and the effect of international conventions, was within a short time
converted into a customary law meeting the pressing needs of modern
life.

Can the same be said of the concept of equidistance in Article 6 of
the Geneva Convention?

* *

25. One prior question calls for resolution: what are the acts of
delimitation which must be tabulated in order to select those which
have contributed to the formation of the material element of custom,
both with reference to the nature of the waters delimited, and with
reference to the situation of the coastal States of those waters, adjacent
States and opposite States.

The Court has considered that only delimitations concerning the con-
tinental shelf and made between adjacent States can be taken into account
as precedents. It seems however that the acts which must be taken into
account in this investigation are, with reference to the nature of the
waters, all those pertaining to the delimitation of maritime waters of
whatever kind: territorial seas, straits, contiguous zones, fishing zones,
continental shelf, epicontinental platform-—to which must be added
lakes. The underlying concept common to all these stretches of water,
which is decisive by way of analogy, is that they all proceed from the
notion of the natural prolongation of the land territory of the coastal
States 2. Thus, the 1953 Committee of Experts, drawing no distinction
in this connection between the territorial sea and the continental shelf,
wrote in its report that it had “considered it important to find a formula
for drawing the international boundaries in the territorial waters of
States, which could also be used for the delimitation of the respective
continental shelves .. .””.

On the other hand, it is obvious that boundary lines dividing rivers
should not be selected as precedents. Moreover, such boundary lines

! In particular, those of G. Scelle and A. de Lapradelle; the representative of the
Federal Republic of Germany. Dr. Miinch, still said of the continental shelf rule at
the Geneva Conference that “‘many authorities reject it de lege lata and de lege
ferenda.”

? Supra, para. 15.


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 125

follow the thalwegs or the navigable channels much more frequently
than the middle of the stream.

The acts of delimitation with reference to adjacent or opposite States
require more detailed examination.

All such acts should be drawn on, again on the ground of their common
underlying concept. The example has been set by the three conventions
adopted at Geneva concerning respectively the territorial sea, the con-
tiguous zone and fishing zones. All three take, in so many words, as
their basis for delimitation “the median line every point of which is
equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines ...”. And those
conventions laid it down that this provision was applicable to lateral
delimitations just as to delimitations between opposite States *.

Should not this assimilation between these two types of delimitation
be reflected in the interpretation of Article 6 of the Convention on the
Continental Shelf, even though the two different terms, median line and
equidistance line, are there employed?

It is imperative in the present case to interpret the Convention on the
Continental Shelf in the light of the formula adopted in the other three
conventions, in accordance with the method of integrating the four
conventions by co-ordination. For the four conventions, voted on the
same day at one and the same meeting, constitute a body of treaties all
falling within the same legal framework, that of the law of the sea.
Thus they were drawn up by the International Law Commission of the
United Nations and submitted to the Geneva Conference in a single
document. Must it not consequently be agreed that, notwithstanding
the differences of wording, or the disparity between the terminology
noticed in the three conventions mentioned on the one hand, and the
Convention on the Continental Shelf on the other, the same equidistance
rule is applicable, according to the meaning of the four conventions, to
lateral delimitations just as to median delimitations?

It will be noticed that the rule having been understood in this way
in international circles, the 13 States which signed the Convention con-
cluded in London on 9 March 1964 took over word for word from the
three above-mentioned Geneva conventions their common formula for
States lying opposite or adjacent to each other.

If nevertheless the text of the Convention on the Continental Shelf
emerged from the deliberations of the conference with a wording different
from that of the other three conventions, that fact is to be attributed to
the contingencies of discussion at a meeting. Delimitations both between
adjacent States and between States lying opposite each other formed the
subject, before the International Law Commission, of a single form of
words covering both situations. The fact that they were mentioned, in

which refers to Article 12 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea.



CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 126

the convention drawn up during the conference in separate paragraphs
of Article 6, and that the two texts were drafted in somewhat different
terms, is to be explained by the vicissitudes of discussion in two Com-
mittees, and does not permit of the deduction therefrom of a difference
between a median line applicable to States lying opposite each other and
an equidistance line for demarcating the boundary between adjacent
States. The travaux préparatoires are no less explicit, in this respect, than
the clarity of the terms employed in the four conventions concerning the
law of the sea, which refer, as to a single whole, to the median line and
equidistant points as applicable to adjacent States and States lying
opposite each other. This amounts to saying, in short, that the notion
of equidistance is the rule for both sorts of delimitation.

*

26. The instruments prior to the Convention on the Continental
Shelf, concerning the delimitation of maritime waters—territorial sea,
straits, lakes, contiguous zone, fishing zones, continental shelf, epicon-
tinental platform— could not be more varied in nature.

It will subsequently be seen that the proclamations and other pro-
nouncements made in 1945 by the United States, in 1947 by Nicaragua,
in 1949 by Saudi Arabia and the States of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Abu
Dhabi, Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah, Umm al Qaiwain and Ajman, and in

agreement between France and Portugal concerning Senegal and what
is referred to as Portuguese Guinea. The same was done in respect of
the boundaries laid down in 1953 under the Australian pearl fisheries
legislation of 1952-1953.

The delimitation of the epicontinental platform between Chile, Ecuador
and Peru followed geographical parallels of latitude.

The Agreement of 15 June 1846 between the United States and Canada,
and the 1928 Act endorsing the Agreement of 19 October 1927 between
Singapore and Johore both follow the channel between the two coasts.

A number of agreements were noted which opted for equal division,
employing the following expressions: “equidistant from” or “half-way
between” the coasts, or along ‘“the middle line”. Such were, for example,
the Agreement of 11 April 1908 between the United States and Great



CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 127

30 January 1932 between Denmark and Sweden, and those of the Peace
Treaty with Italy of 10 February 1947, delimiting the territorial waters
of Trieste, and, finally, the Agreement of 22 February 1958 between
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

Delimitations of lakes sometimes referred to the median line or the
middle of the water, sometimes to the thalweg, and sometimes followed
the banks of the lake or did not purport to be based on any method.

A rather special case was that of the Agreement of 25 February 1953
between France and Switzerland for the delimitation of the Lake of
Geneva along “... a median line and two transversal arms .. .”, this
line being “replaced, for practical reasons by a six-sided polygonal line

ments of 1918 between China and Hong Kong and of 1925 between the
United States and Canada; the 1942 treaty between the United Kingdom
and Venezuela and the 1957 Agreement between the Soviet Union and
Norway.

27. It does not seem that any conclusion can be drawn from these
extremely varied formulae which have been employed, unless it be that
they constitute a set of methods to which States might freely have
recourse in order to reconcile their respective interests. Accordingly,
the use of one method or another, not excepting that which employs
the median line, does not indicate any opinio juris based on the awareness


*
* *

28. Since the above-mentioned acts adopting the median line or the
equidistance line are not capable of creating a custom, it remains to be
seen whether those which have occurred since the signature of the Con-
vention on the Continental Shelf, by being added thereto, have had this
effect.

In order to resolve this question, the Court argues that a norm-
creating convention has, as such, an influence on the formation of custom.
The function of State practice is envisaged, on this line of reasoning,
as being appropriate cases to support the potentially norm-creating


It appears to me that this reasoning is contrary to both the letter and
the spirit of Article 38. paragraph | (b), of the Court's Statute, which


CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 128

bases custom on State practice. The 1958 Convention, like any other
convention, has therefore no other influence on the formation of custom
than that which is conferred upon it by the States who have ratified it,
or have merely signed it: the deliberate legal act of ratification, and the
legal fact of signature, both constitute attitudes which count in the
enumeration of the elements of State practice.

transformation of the equidistance method into a rule of customary
law, it would be necessary to tabulate:

(a) the deliberate legal acts of ratification of the aforesaid Conventions;

(b) the legal facts of signature of the Conventions;

(ce) the various acts of delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous
zone, fishing zones, straits, lakes, the continental shelf and the
epicontinental platform.

included under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) include: the Soviet Union,
Finland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, the United
States and the Federal Republic of Germany. There is thus no need to
include them once again among the total number of States which have
carried out acts of delimitation.

In addition to the above-mentioned States, the Netherlands and Den-
mark mention in their Common Rejoinder those which have opted for
the equidistance line.

So far as Kuwait is concerned, the representatives of the Federal
Republic argued that its agreement with the concessionary company
could not be regarded as a precedent, since it was not a convention be-
tween States.

Numerous concessions under public law have given rise to judicial
precedents in various questions of international law. Nevertheless, an
agreement concerning a concession by a State to a company does not,
per se or as such, constitute an element of the practice which contributes
to the creation of international custom. It is only by a legitimate assimila-

unilateral act, that the case of Kuwait might be considered. Never-
theless, the attitude which is attributed to it, like that attributed to Iran,
demands careful thought. They might have been considered as precedents
contributing towards the establishment of custom if those States had not
refrained from referring to the equidistance method, although their legal
advisers must assuredly have been aware of the discussions that had taken
place at the Geneva Conference. The inmost thoughts of those States
cannot be plumbed, so as to claim that an opinio juris attached to the


demarcations which they made without referring to a rule they believed
themselves obliged to apply. The more so in that on account of the steps
taken by each of them in drawing lines of demarcation of their continental
shelves one cannot help looking back to their respective declarations of
1947 and 1955, in which they specified that they would rely in this con-
nection on the notion of equity.

So far as Iraq is concerned, it was stated in the Rejoinder that that
State ‘automatically considered that the equidistance principle expressed
in Article 6 of the Continental Shelf Convention would govern the delimi-
tation of her continental shelf in the absence of an agreement or of special
circumstances justifying another boundary line I”. But the declaration
of Iraq was made on 10 April 1958, i.e., before the signature of the Geneva
Convention; the reference to Article 6 thereof is consequently out of

like the Truman Proclamation, as starting a trend towards a new custom.

The Agreement between the United Kingdom and Norway, signed on
10 March 1965, which adopted the equidistance rule, constitutes another
precedent. The same can be said of the Agreement of 8 December 1965
between Denmark and Norway, the Proclamation of 30 March 1967 by
the President of the Republic of Tanzania concerning the delimitation
of the territorial sea between Tanzania and Kenya, the Agreement of
20 March 1967 between Morocco and Spain dealing with the Straits of
Gibraltar, and the Agreement of 24 July 1968 between Sweden and Nor-
way.

it did not sign the Convention on the Continental Shelf, the Belgian
Government, in a Note of 15 September 1965 from the Belgian Embassy
to the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that “the two
countries are in agreement on the principle of equidistance and on its
practical application”. Furthermore, the provisions of the Convention
on the Continental Shelf were adopted in a bill, accompanied by an
exposé des motifs which was submitted to the Chamber of Representatives
on 23 October 1967. The bill, while totally devoid of legal effect, never-
theless expresses the official point of view of the Government. It con-
stitutes one of those acts within the municipal legal order which can be
counted among the precedents to be taken into consideration, where
appropriate, for recognizing the existence of a custom. In any event, the
attitude of the Belgian Government is expressed without any possible
equivocation in the statement contained in the State to State communica-
