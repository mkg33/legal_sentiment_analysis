In the course of public hearings held on May 16th and 17th, 1951,
the Court heard statements by M. José Gabriel de la Vega, Agent,
on behalf of the Government of Colombia, and by M. G. Gidel,
Counsel, on behalf of the Government of Peru; furthermore, in
accordance with Article 66, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court, it
heard a statement on the interpretation of the Havana Convention,
presented on behalf of the Government of Cuba by Mme. Flora
Diaz Parrado, Agent.

Ar the end of the written proceedings, the Parties presented the
following Submissions :

The Government of Cuba, availing itself of the right which
Article 63 of the Statute of the Court confers on States parties
to a convention, filed a Declaration of Intervention with the
Registry on March 13th, 1951, and attached thereto a Memorandum
in which it stated its views in regard to the interpretation of the
Havana Convention of 1928 ratified by it and also its general
attitude towards asylum. The Court considered that this Memo-
randum was regarded by the Government of Cuba as constituting
the written observations provided for in paragraph 4 of Article 66
of the Rules of Court.

The Government of Peru contended that the intervention of the
Government of Cuba was inadmissible, owing to the Declaration
of Intervention being out of time, and to the fact that the Declara-
tion and the Memorandum accompanying it did not constitute
an intervention in the true meaning of the term, but an attempt
by a third State to appeal against the Judgment delivered by the
Court on November 20th, 1950.

In regard to that question, the Court observes that every inter-
vention is incidental to the proceedings in a case ; it follows that
a declaration filed as an intervention only acquires that character,
in law, if it actually relates to the subject-matter of the pending
proceedings. The subject-matter of the present case differs from
that of the case which was terminated by the Judgment of
November zoth, 1950: it concerns a question—the surrender of
Haya de la Torre to the Peruvian authorities—which in the previous



case was completely outside the Submissions of the Parties, and
which was in consequence in no way decided by the above-
mentioned Judgment.

In these circumstances, the only point which it is necessary to
ascertain is whether the object of the intervention of the Govern-
ment of Cuba is in fact the interpretation ofthe Havana Convention
in regard to the question whether Colombia is under an obligation
to surrender the refugee to the Peruvian authorities.

On that point, the Court observes that the Memorandurn attached
to the Declaration of Intervention of the Government of Cuba is
devoted almost entirely to a discussion of the questions which the
Judgment of November 2oth, 1950, had already decided with the
authority of res judicata, and that, to that extent, it does not
satisfy the conditions of a genuine intervention. However, at the
public hearing on May 15th, 1951, the Agent of the Government
of Cuba stated that the intervention was based on the fact that
the Court was required to interpret a new aspect of the Havana
Convention, an aspect which the Court had not been called on
to consider in its Judgment of November 20th, 1950.

Reduced in this way, and operating within these limits, the inter-
vention of the Government of Cuba conformed to the conditions of
Article 63 of the Statute, and the Court, having deliberated on the
matter, decided on May 16th to admit the intervention in pursuance
of paragraph 2 of Article 66 of the Rules of Court.

In the first part of its principal Submission the Government of
Colombia requests the Court
“to state in what manner the Judgment of November 20th, 1950,


shall be executed by Colombia and Peru....”.

On the other hand, the Government of Peru in its first Submission
requests the Court

“to state in what manner the Judgment of November zoth, 1950,
shall be executed by Colombia”.

These Submissions are both designed to obtain a decision from
the Court as to the manner in which the asylum should be term-
inated. The portion of the judgment of November zoth, 1950, to
which they refer is the passage where, in pronouncing on the ques-
tion of the regularity of the asylum, it declares that the grant of



asylum was not made in conformity with Article 2, paragraph 2
(“First”), of the Havana Convention on Asylum of 1928. The Court
observes that the Judgment confined itself, in this connection, to
defining the legal relations which the Havana Convention had
established between the Parties. It did not give any directions to
the Parties, and entails for them only the obligation of compliance
therewith. The interrogative form in which they have formulated
their Submissions shows that they desire that the Court should
make a choice amongst the various courses by which the asylum
may be terminated. But these courses are conditioned by facts and
by possibilities which, to a very large extent, the Parties are alone
in a position to appreciate. A choice amongst them could not be
based on legal considerations, but only on considerations of practic-
ability or of political expediency ; it is not part of the Court’s
judicial function to make such a choice.

In the second part of its principal Submission, the Government of
Colombia requests the Court

“to adjudge and declare that Colombia is not bound, in execu-
tion of the said Judgment of November 2oth, 1950, to deliver
M. Victor Raûl Haya de la Torre to the Peruvian authorities”.

This part of the principal Submission of Colombia is strictly
limited by the words ‘’in execution of the said Judgment of Novem-
ber 2oth, 1050”. These words serve to confine the request thus
formulated, as in the first part of the same Submission, to the
execution of the Judgment of November 20th, 1950.

As was stated both in that Judgment and in the Judgment of
November 27th, 1950, the Government of Peru had not demanded
the surrender of the refugee. This question was not submitted to
the Court and consequently was not decided by it. It is not there-
fore possible to deduce from the Judgment of November 20th
any conclusion as to the existence or non-existence of an obligation
to surrender the refugee. In these circumstances, the Court is not
in a position to state, merely on the basis of the Judgment of
November 20th, whether Colombia is or is not bound to surrender
the refugee to the Peruvian authorities.

The alternative Submission of the Government of Colombia is as
follows :

“In the event of the Court not delivering judgment on the
foregoing Submission, may it please the Court to adjudge and
declare, in the exercise of its ordinary competence, that Colombia
is not bound to deliver the politically accused M. Victor Raul Haya
de la Torre to the Peruvian authorities.”

In its second Submission the Government of Peru requests the
Court



“to dismiss the Submissions of Colombia by which the Court
is asked to state solely (“sans plus”) that Colombia is not bound
to deliver Victor Radl Haya de la Torre to the Peruvian author-
ities”.

The Government of Peru states in this Submission that the Court
is asked by the Submissions of Colombia ‘to state solely that Colom-
bia is not bound....”. By using this word “solely” (“sans plus”)
the Government of Peru wishes to convey that the legal position
which the Judgment of November 2oth created for it must in any
case be preserved ; it refers thus to the statement set forth in its
third Submission, which will be examined later.

As mentioned above, the question of the surrender of the refugee
was not decided by the Judgment of November 20th. This question
is new ; it was raised by Peru in its Note to Colombia of Novem-
ber 28th, 1950, and was submitted to the Court by the Application
of Colombia of December 13th, 1950. There is consequently no
res judicata upon the question of surrender.

According to the Havana Convention, diplomatic asylum is a
provisional measure for the temporary protection of political
offenders. Even if regularly granted it cannot be prolonged inde-
finitely, but must be terminated as soon as possible. It can, accord-
ing to Article 2, paragraph 2, only be granted ‘‘for the period of
time strictly indispensable for the person who has sought asylum
to ensure in some other way his safety”.

The Court finds that the Convention does not give a complete
answer to the question of the manner in which an asylum shall
be terminated.

As to persons accused of or condemned for common crimes who
seek refuge, Article 1 prescribes that they shall be surrendered upon
request of the local government. For “political offenders” another
method of terminating asylum is prescribed, namely, the grant of
a safe-conduct for the departure from the country. But, under the
terms of the Judgment of November 20th, a safe-conduct can only
be claimed under the Havana Convention if the asylum has been
regularly granted and maintained and if the territorial State has
required that the refugee should be sent out of the country. For
cases in which the asylum has not been regularly granted or main-
tained, no provision is made as to the method of termination. Nor
is any provision made in this matter in cases where the territorial
State has not requested the departure of the refugee. Thus, though
the Convention prescribes that the duration of the asylum shall
be limited to the time “strictly indispensable….”, it is silent on
the question how the asylum should be terminated in a variety
of different situations.

As the Court pointed out in its Judgment of November 2oth,
the Havana Convention, the first article of which requires
that persons accused of or condemned for common crimes shall be
surrendered to the territorial authorities, does not contain any



similar provision in regard to political offenders. This silence cannot
be interpreted as imposing an obligation to surrender the refugee
in case the asylum was granted to him contrary to the provisions
of Article 2 of the Convention. Such an interpretation would be
repugnant to the spirit which animated that Convention in conform-
ity with the Latin-American tradition in regard to asylum, a tradi-
tion in accordance with which political refugees should not be
surrendered. There is nothing in that tradition to indicate that an
exception should be made where asylum has been irregularly
granted. If it has been intended to abandon that tradition, an
express provision to that effect would have been needed, and the
Havana Convention contains no such provision. The silence of the
Convention implies that it was intended to leave the adjustment
of the consequences of this situation to decisions inspired by consi-
derations of convenience or of simple political expediency. To infer
from this silence that there is an obligation to surrender a person
to whom asylum has been irregularly granted would be to disregard
both the rôle of these extra-legal factors in the development of
asylum in Latin America, and the spirit of the Havana Convention
itself.

In its Judgment of November 2oth the Court pointed out that,
in principle, asylum cannot be opposed to the operation of justice.
The safety which arises out of asylum cannot be construed as a
protection against the regular application of the laws and against
the jurisdiction of legally constituted tribunals. Protection thus
understood would authorize the diplomatic agent to obstruct the
application of the laws of the country, whereas it is his duty to
respect them. The Court further said that it could not admit that
the States signatories to the Havana Convention intended to
substitute for the practice of the Latin-American republics a legal
system which would guarantee to their own nationals accused of
political offences the privilege of evading national jurisdiction.
But it would be an entirely different thing to say that the State
granting an irregular asylum is obliged to surrender the refugee
to the local authorities. Such an obligation to render positive
assistance to these authorities in their prosecution of a political
refugee would far exceed the above-mentioned findings of the
Court and could not be recognized without an express provision
to that effect in the Convention.

Thus, the Havana Convention does not justify the view that
the obligation incumbent on a State to terminate an asylum

The third Submission of the Government of Peru is as follows:

“In the event of the Court not delivering judgment on Sub-
mission No. I, to adjudge and declare that the asylum granted to
Sefior Victor Raûl Haya de la Torre on January 3rd, 1949, and
maintained since that date, having been judged to be contrary to
Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Havana Convention of 1928, it ought
to have ceased immediately after the delivery of the Judgment
of November 20th, 1950, and must in any case cease forthwith, in
order that Peruvian justice may resume its normal course which
has been suspended.”

The Government of Colombia has requested the Court to reject
this Submission.

In its Judgment of November zoth, the Court held that the
grant of asylum by the Government. of Colombia to Haya de la
Torre was not made in conformity with Article 2, paragraph 2
(“First”), of the Convention. This decision entails a legal conse-
quence, namely that of putting an end to an illegal situation : the
Government of Colombia which had granted the asylum irregularly
is bound to terminate it. As the asylum is still being maintained,
the Government of Peru is legally entitled to claim that it should
cease.

But the latter Government adds in its Submission a demand
that the asylum should cease “in order that Peruvian justice may
resume its normal course which has been suspended”. This addition
appears to involve, indirectly, a claim for the surrender of the
refugee. For the reasons given above, this part of the Submission
of the Government of Peru cannot be accepted.

The Court has thus arrived at the conclusion that the asylum
must cease, but that the Government of Colombia is under no
obligation to bring this about by surrendering the refugee to the
Peruvian authorities. There is no contradiction between these
two findings, since surrender is not the only way of terminating
asylum.


Having thus defined in accordance with the Havana Convention
the legal relations between the Parties with regard to the matters
referred to it, the Court has completed its task. It is unable to give
any practical advice as to the various courses which might be
followed with a view to terminating the asylum, since, by doing
so, it would depart from its judicial function. But it can be assumed
that the Parties, now that their mutual legal relations have been
made clear, will be able to find a practical and satisfactory solution
by seeking guidance from those considerations of courtesy and
good-neighbourliness which, in matters of asylum, have always
held a prominent place in the relations between the Latin-American
republics.

M. ALAYZA Ÿ Paz SOLDAN, Judge ad hoc, declares that if the Court
had stated under the second point of the operative clause that
Colombia was under no obligation, as the sole means of executing
the Judgment, to surrender the refugee to the Government of Peru,
he would have been in a position to concur in the opinion of the
majority of the Court. But the brevity of the sentence employed,
which may be misunderstood, prevents him from concurring in the
opinion of the Court as a whole.
