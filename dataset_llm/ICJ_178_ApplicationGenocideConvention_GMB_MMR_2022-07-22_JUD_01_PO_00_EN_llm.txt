                       Whether The Gambia is the “real applicant” (first preliminary objection).

                   Jurisdiction ratione personae — Articles 34 and 35 of Statute of Court and
                Article 93, paragraph 1, of Charter of United Nations — The Gambia being a
                Member of United Nations and ipso facto party to Statute of Court — Allegation
                that The Gambia acted as organ or proxy of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation
                (OIC), the “real applicant” in the case — Institution of proceedings by The Gam-
                bia in its own name — The Gambia alleging a dispute between it and Myanmar
                regarding its own rights under Genocide Convention — Support from intergovern-
                mental organization to a State in instituting proceedings not detracting from status
                as applicant before the Court — Court satisfied that The Gambia is the Applicant
                in the case.

                  Admissibility of the Application — Allegation that attempt to bring case on
                behalf of OIC constitutes abuse of process or is inadmissible on basis of other

                              application of the genocide convention (judgment)                  479

                considerations — No evidence that conduct of The Gambia amounts to abuse of
                process — No other grounds of inadmissibility either.

                       First preliminary objection rejected.

                   Existence of dispute between the Parties (fourth preliminary objection).
                   “Dispute” being a disagreement on a point of law or fact — Two sides must hold
                clearly opposite views — No requirement that respondent expressly opposes claims
                of applicant — Rejection of claims may sometimes be inferred from silence of
                respondent.
                   Statements of Parties’ representatives before United Nations General Assembly
                in September 2018 and September 2019 — No specific mention of Genocide Con-
                vention in The Gambia’s statements — However, specific reference to treaty or its
                provisions not required — Parties’ statements indicating opposition of views on
                whether treatment of the Rohingya group by Myanmar was consistent with its
                obligations under Genocide Convention — Note Verbale of 11 October 2019
                expressing specifically and in legal terms The Gambia’s position — Rejection of
                claims also inferred from Myanmar’s failure to respond to Note Verbale.


                       Dispute existed on date of Application — Fourth preliminary objection rejected.

                   Myanmar’s reservation to Article VIII of Genocide Convention (third prelimi-
                nary objection).
                   Whether Article VIII governs seisin of Court — Ordinary meaning of terms in
                Article VIII — Article VIII addressing the prevention and suppression of genocide
                at the political level — Article VIII to be interpreted in context — Article IX pro-
                viding conditions for recourse to Court — Article VIII not governing seisin of
                Court — No need to resort to supplementary means of interpretation.

                   Myanmar’s reservation to Article VIII irrelevant — Third preliminary objection
                rejected.

                   The Gambia’s standing (second preliminary objection).
                   Common interest of all States parties to Genocide Convention to ensure preven-
                tion, suppression and punishment of genocide — Any State party entitled to invoke
                the responsibility of another State party for alleged breach of obligations erga
                omnes partes — Special interest not required — Nationality of victims not rele-
                vant — Article IX not limiting category of States parties entitled to bring claims
                for alleged breaches of obligations erga omnes partes under Convention.

                  Bangladesh facing large influx of members of the Rohingya group — This fact
                not affecting right of all other Contracting Parties to assert common interest in
                compliance with obligations erga omnes partes under Genocide Convention or pre-





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 9                                                                                     3/09/23 09:53

                         application of the genocide convention (judgment)                 480

                cluding The Gambia’s standing — No need to address arguments relating to Ban-
                gladesh’s reservation to Article IX.

                  The Gambia has standing to invoke responsibility of Myanmar for alleged
                breaches of obligations under Articles I, III, IV and V of Convention — Second
                preliminary objection rejected.
