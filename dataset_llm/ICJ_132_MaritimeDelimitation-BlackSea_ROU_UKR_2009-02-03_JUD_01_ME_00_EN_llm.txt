   the matter, did not deem it necessary to state an opinion.” (ILC
   Yearbook, 1956, Vol. II, p. 270.)

In the light of the above, the ILC did not, at the time, intend to define
ecisely the limit beyond which a dyke, jetty or works would no longer
rm “an integral part of the harbour system”. The Court concludes from
 s that there are grounds for proceeding on a case-by-case basis, and
at the text of Article 11 of UNCLOS and the travaux préparatoires do
 t preclude the possibility of interpreting restrictively the concept of
 rbour works so as to avoid or mitigate the problem of excessive length
entified by the ILC. This may be particularly true where, as here, the
 estion is one of delimitation of areas seaward of the territorial sea.

 135. With regard to the use of the Sulina dyke as a base point for the
esent delimitation, the Court must consider the relevance of Romania’s
 tification to the United Nations under Article 16 of UNCLOS, in
hich Romania used the seaward end of the Sulina dyke as a base point
r drawing the baseline for its territorial sea. This choice of base points
 s not contested by Ukraine.

136. Article 16 provides that “the base lines for measuring the breadth
 the territorial sea . . . and the lines of delimitation [of the territorial
a] shall be shown on charts” (paragraph 1) and that “the coastal State
all deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General
 the United Nations”. Since Article 57 (regarding the breadth of the
clusive economic zone) and Article 76, paragraph 1, (regarding the
finition of the continental shelf) of UNCLOS stipulate that these mari-
me zones can extend to a distance of 200 nautical miles “from the base-


 es from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured”, the ques-
 n arises as to whether the same seaward end of the Sulina dyke has to
  retained for the purpose of the present delimitation.
 137. The Court observes that the issue of determining the baseline for
e purpose of measuring the breadth of the continental shelf and the
clusive economic zone and the issue of identifying base points for
awing an equidistance/median line for the purpose of delimiting the
ntinental shelf and the exclusive economic zone between adjacent/
 posite States are two different issues.
 In the first case, the coastal State, in conformity with the provisions of
NCLOS (Articles 7, 9, 10, 12 and 15), may determine the relevant base
 ints. It is nevertheless an exercise which has always an international
pect (see Fisheries (United Kingdom v. Norway), Judgment, I.C.J.
 ports 1951, p. 132). In the second case, the delimitation of the mari-
me areas involving two or more States, the Court should not base itself
  ely on the choice of base points made by one of those Parties. The
ourt must, when delimiting the continental shelf and exclusive eco-
 mic zones, select base points by reference to the physical geography of
e relevant coasts.
 138. As for the specific characteristics of the seaward end of the Sulina
 ke as a relevant base point for constructing the provisional equidis-
nce line, the Court points out that, irrespective of its length, no
nvincing evidence has been presented that this dyke serves any direct
 rpose in port activities. For these reasons, the Court is not satisfied that
e seaward end of the Sulina dyke is a proper base point for the pur-
 ses of the construction of a provisional equidistance line delimiting the
ntinental shelf and the exclusive economic zones.
 139. On the other hand, while the landward end of the dyke may not
  an integral part of the Romanian mainland, it is a fixed point on it.
  e land at this point is protected from shifts in the coastline due to
arine processes. As a relevant base point for the purposes of the first
  ge of delimitation, it has the advantage, unlike the seaward end of the
 ke, of not giving greater importance to an installation than to the
 ysical geography of the landmass.
 140. For these reasons, the Court is of the opinion that the landward
d of the Sulina dyke where it joins the Romanian mainland should be
ed as a base point for the establishment of the provisional equidistance
 e.
 141. The Court therefore concludes that it will use the Sacalin Penin-
  a (44° 50′ 28″ N and 29° 36′ 52″ E) and the landward end of the Sulina
 ke (45° 09′ 51.9″ N and 29° 43′ 14.5″ E) 2 as base points on the Roma-
an coast.

 Co-ordinates provided by the Parties in Pulkovo datum.


142. The Court will now turn to identifying the relevant base points on
kraine’s coast, starting with the sector of adjacent coasts.

143. The Court deems it appropriate in this first sector to use the
uth-eastern tip of Tsyganka Island on the Ukrainian side, which is the
unterpart of the landward end of the Sulina dyke on the Romanian
 e. Its location is significant, because in this area of adjacency it is the
ost prominent point on the Ukrainian coast.
144. In this sector of adjacent coasts, the Court needs also to consider
e relevance of the Ukrainian base point situated on the island of Kuban-
y as a base point for use in constructing the provisional equidistance
 e. The Court notes that this base point does not produce any effect on
e equidistance line plotted by reference to the base point on Tsyganka
and on the Ukrainian coast and the base point on the landward end of
e Sulina dyke on the Romanian coast. This base point is therefore to be
garded as irrelevant for the purposes of the present delimitation.
145. The Court will now consider the base points on the section of
kraine’s coast opposite Romania’s coast.
146. It will start with Cape Tarkhankut, the most seaward point facing
omania’s coast on the Crimean coast. The Crimean coastline juts out
 nificantly here, and its configuration makes this cape an appropriate
oice as a relevant base point.

 . 367-368, paras. 139-146). However, Serpents’ Island, lying alone and


 Co-ordinates provided by the Parties in Pulkovo datum.


me 20 nautical miles away from the mainland, is not one of a cluster of
nge islands constituting “the coast” of Ukraine.

To count Serpents’ Island as a relevant part of the coast would amount
  grafting an extraneous element onto Ukraine’s coastline ; the conse-
 ence would be a judicial refashioning of geography, which neither the
w nor practice of maritime delimitation authorizes. The Court is thus of
e view that Serpents’ Island cannot be taken to form part of Ukraine’s
astal configuration (cf. the islet of Filfla in the case concerning Conti-
ntal Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
85, p. 13).
For this reason, the Court considers it inappropriate to select any base
 ints on Serpents’ Island for the construction of a provisional equidis-
nce line between the coasts of Romania and Ukraine. Further aspects
evant to Serpents’ Island are dealt with at paragraphs 179 to 188
low.

       8.2. Construction of the Provisional Equidistance Line
150. Romania argues that the first segment of the maritime boundary
limiting the maritime areas of the two States situated beyond their ter-
orial seas was established by successive agreements between Romania
d the Soviet Union : from the final point of the boundary separating
e territorial seas of the two States at 45° 05′ 21″ N and 30° 02′ 27″ E, the
aritime boundary passes along the 12-nautical-mile arc of the circle
ound Serpents’ Island until it reaches a point situated on that arc at
° 14′ 20″ N and 30° 29′ 12″ E (see Section 4). Romania contends that the
aritime boundary beyond that point was never delimited between Roma-
a and the USSR or Ukraine. Romania draws a provisional equidis-
nce line from the final point of the land/river boundary between the two
ates taking into account the salient base points of the adjacent Roma-
an and Ukrainian coasts. These are : on the Romanian coast, the sea-
  rd end of the Sulina dyke ; and on the Ukrainian coast, the island of
ubansky and Cape Burnas. As the point lying on the arc around Ser-
nts’ Island at 45° 14′ 20″ N and 30° 29′ 12″ E, is not situated on the
uidistance line, but about 2.5 nautical miles to the north, the delimita-
 n of the maritime boundary beyond this point must, in Romania’s
  w, start by joining it to the provisional equidistance line. The line thus
awn passes through the point at 45° 11′ 59″ N and 30° 49′ 16″ E, situ-
ed practically midway between the 12-nautical-mile arc around Ser-
nts’ Island and the tripoint as between the Romanian and Ukrainian
 jacent coasts and the opposite Crimean coast, situated at 45° 09′ 45″ N
 d 31° 08′ 40″ E. Romania contends that, from this point southwards,
e delimitation is governed by the opposite Romanian and Ukrainian
asts.




151. Romania calculates the median line taking into account the sali-
t base points on the relevant opposite coasts of the two States (the sea-
 rd end of the Sulina dyke and the outer end of the Sacalin Peninsula
  the Romanian coast, and Capes Tarkhankut and Khersones on the
krainian coast). Romania’s equidistance line in the sector of opposite
asts thus coincides with the segment of the median line running from,
 the north, the tripoint as between the Romanian and Ukrainian adja-
nt coasts and the opposite Crimean coast to, in the south, the point
yond which the interests of third States may be affected, which Roma-
a situates at 43° 26′ 50″ N and 31° 20′ 10″ E.

                                    *
 152. Ukraine maintains that the provisional equidistance line must be
nstructed by reference to the base points on each Party’s baselines from
hich the breadth of its territorial sea is measured. Thus, on the Roma-
an side, Ukraine uses the base points at the seaward end of the Sulina
 ke and on the Sacalin Peninsula. On its own side, it uses the base
 ints on Serpents’ Island and at the tip of Cape Khersones. The provi-
  nal equidistance line advocated by Ukraine starts at the point of inter-
ction of the territorial seas of the Parties identified in Article 1 of the
 03 State Border Régime Treaty (45° 05′ 21″ N and 30° 02′ 27″ E). The
 e then runs in a southerly direction until the point at 44° 48′ 24″ N and
 ° 10′ 56″ E, after which it turns to run in a south-easterly direction until
e point at 43° 55′ 33″ N and 31° 23′ 26″ E and thereafter continues due
uth.



                                   * *
153. The Court recalls that the base points which must be used in con-
 ucting the provisional equidistance line are those situated on the Saca-
  Peninsula and the landward end of the Sulina dyke on the Romanian
ast, and Tsyganka Island, Cape Tarkhankut and Cape Khersones on
e Ukrainian coast.
154. In its initial segment the provisional equidistance line between the
omanian and Ukrainian adjacent coasts is controlled by base points
cated on the landward end of the Sulina dyke on the Romanian coast
 d south-eastern tip of Tsyganka Island on the Ukrainian coast. It runs
 a south-easterly direction, from a point lying midway between these
 o base points, until Point A (with co-ordinates 44° 46′ 38.7″ N and
° 58′ 37.3″ E) where it becomes affected by a base point located on the
 calin Peninsula on the Romanian coast. At Point A the equidistance
 e slightly changes direction and continues to Point B (with co-
dinates 44° 44′ 13.4″ N and 31° 10′ 27.7″ E) where it becomes affected by
e base point located on Cape Tarkhankut on Ukraine’s opposite coasts.


 Point B the equidistance line turns south-south-east and continues to
int C (with co-ordinates 44° 02′ 53.0″ N and 31° 24′ 35.0″ E), calculated
th reference to base points on the Sacalin Peninsula on the Romanian
ast and Capes Tarkhankut and Khersones on the Ukrainian coast.
om Point C the equidistance line, starting at an azimuth of 185° 23′ 54.5″ 4,
ns in a southerly direction. This line remains governed by the base
ints on the Sacalin Peninsula on the Romanian coast and Cape Kher-
nes on the Ukrainian coast.

d 7, pp. 114-115.)


                        9. RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES

155. As the Court indicated above (paragraphs 120-121), once the pro-
 ional equidistance line has been drawn, it shall “then [consider] whether
ere are factors calling for the adjustment or shifting of that line in order
 achieve an ‘equitable result’” (Land and Maritime Boundary between
 meroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria : Equatorial Guinea inter-
ning), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 441, para. 288). Such factors
 ve usually been referred to in the jurisprudence of the Court, since the
orth Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark ;
 deral Republic of Germany/Netherlands) cases, as the relevant circum-
 nces (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 53, para. 53). Their function is
 verify that the provisional equidistance line, drawn by the geometrical
ethod from the determined base points on the coasts of the Parties is
 t, in light of the particular circumstances of the case, perceived as in-
uitable. If such would be the case, the Court should adjust the line in
der to achieve the “equitable solution” as required by Articles 74, para-
aph 1, and 83, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS.

156. The Parties suggested and discussed several factors which they
nsider as the possible relevant circumstances of the case. They arrive at
 ferent conclusions. Romania argues that its provisional equidistance
 e achieves the equitable result and thus does not require any adjust-
ent. Ukraine, on the other hand, submits that there are relevant circum-
 nces which call for the adjustment of its provisional equidistance line
 y moving the provisional line closer to the Romanian coast”.

  The geographical co-ordinates used by the Parties for the drawing of the equidistance
es proposed by them are given by reference to Pulkovo datum. The Court, for its part,
  chosen to use WGS 84 datum. The positions of Points A, B and C are given by ref-
nce to that geodetic datum. The equidistance line described in this paragraph is a geo-
 ic line and the azimuth given is a geodetic azimuth based on WGS 84 datum.



157. Before addressing the relevant circumstances referred to by the
 rties, the Court wishes to recall that the provisional equidistance line it
s drawn in Section 8 above does not coincide with the provisional lines
awn either by Ukraine or Romania. Therefore, it is this line, drawn by
e Court, and not by Romania or Ukraine, which will be in the focus of
e Court’s attention when analysing what the Parties consider to be the
evant circumstances of the case.

           9.1. Disproportion between Lengths of Coasts
158. The circumstance which Ukraine invokes in order to justify its
 im that the provisional equidistance line should be adjusted by moving
e delimitation line closer to Romania’s coast is the disparity between
e length of the Parties’ coasts abutting on the delimitation area.

                                    *
 159. Romania acknowledges that the general configuration of the
 asts may constitute, given the particular geographical context, a rele-
 nt circumstance that can be taken into consideration with a view to
 justing the equidistance line. However, with regard specifically to any
  proportion between the lengths of the Parties’ coasts, Romania notes
at in a maritime delimitation it is rare for the disparities between the
 rties’ coasts to feature as a relevant circumstance. Moreover, in the
esent case, there is no manifest disparity in the respective coastal
ngths of Romania and Ukraine.
 160. Romania adds that in any event proportionality should be dealt
 th “only after having identified the line resulting from the application
  the equitable principles/special circumstances approach”.

161. In conclusion Romania is of the view that the alleged “geographi-
 predominance of Ukraine in the area” and “the disparity between
astal lengths” of the Parties should not be considered relevant circum-
nces in the case.

                                    *
162. With regard to the role which may be played by the coastal con-
uration, Ukraine states that there is a broad margin of appreciation as
 its scope as a relevant circumstance. In the circumstances of the cur-
nt case, Ukraine argues that the coastal configuration clearly shows the
ographical predominance of Ukraine in the relevant area which also
 ds an expression in terms of coastal length : the Ukrainian relevant
ast is more than four times longer than the coast of Romania. Ukraine
 tes that in almost all maritime delimitation cases dealt with by inter-
tional tribunals, “comparison of the lengths of the relevant coasts has
cupied a quite significant place and even played a decisive role in a
 mber of the decisions taken”. Thus, according to Ukraine, the marked




proportion between lengths of the Parties’ coasts is a relevant circum-
 nce to be taken into account in the construction of a delimitation line
d should result in a shifting of the provisional equidistance line in
der to produce an equitable result.


                                  * *
 163. The Court observes that the respective length of coasts can play
  role in identifying the equidistance line which has been provisionally
 ablished. Delimitation is a function which is different from the appor-
 nment of resources or areas (see North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal
 public of Germany/Denmark ; Federal Republic of Germany/Nether-
nds), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 22, para. 18). There is no prin-
ple of proportionality as such which bears on the initial establishment
 the provisional equidistance line.
 164. Where disparities in the lengths of coasts are particularly marked,
e Court may choose to treat that fact of geography as a relevant cir-
 mstance that would require some adjustments to the provisional equi-
 tance line to be made.
 165. In the case concerning Land and Maritime Boundary between
 meroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria ; Equatorial Guinea inter-
ning), the Court acknowledged “that a substantial difference in the
ngths of the parties’ respective coastlines may be a factor to be taken
 o consideration in order to adjust or shift the provisional delimitation
 e” (Judgment, I.C.J. Report 2002, p. 446, para. 301 ; emphasis added),
 hough it found that in the circumstances there was no reason to shift
e equidistance line.
 166. In the case concerning Maritime Delimitation in the Area between
 eenland and Jan Mayen (Denmark v. Norway), the Court found that
e disparity between the lengths of the coasts of Jan Mayen and Green-
nd (approximately 1:9) constituted a “special circumstance” requiring
odification of the provisional median line, by moving it closer to the
 ast of Jan Mayen, to avoid inequitable results for both the continental
elf and the fisheries zone. The Court stated that :

      “It should, however, be made clear that taking account of the dis-
   parity of coastal lengths does not mean a direct and mathematical
   application of the relationship between the length of the coastal
   front of eastern Greenland and that of Jan Mayen.” (Judgment,
   I.C.J. Reports 1993, p. 69, para. 69.)
en it recalled its observation from the Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab
mahiriya/Malta) case :
     “If such a use of proportionality were right, it is difficult indeed to
   see what room would be left for any other consideration ; for it
   would be at once the principle of entitlement to continental shelf


   rights and also the method of putting that principle into operation.
   Its weakness as a basis of argument, however, is that the use of pro-
   portionality as a method in its own right is wanting of support in the
   practice of States, in the public expression of their views at (in par-
   ticular) the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
   or in the jurisprudence.” Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1985, p. 45,
   para. 58.)
 In the latter case, the Court was of the view that the difference in the
ngths of the relevant coasts of Malta and Libya (being in ratio 1:8) “is
  great as to justify the adjustment of the median line” (ibid., p. 50,
 ra. 68 ; emphasis added). The Court added that “the degree of such
 justment does not depend upon a mathematical operation and remains
  be examined” (ibid.).
 167. The Court further notes that in the Delimitation of the Maritime
 undary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America)
se, the Chamber considered that “in certain circumstances, the appro-
  ate consequences may be drawn from any inequalities in the extent of
e coasts of two States into the same area of delimitation” (Judgment,
C.J. Reports 1984, p. 313, para. 157 ; emphasis added). However, it
ust be kept in mind that the Chamber did so in the context of discuss-
g what could be “the equitable criteria that may be taken into consid-
ation for an international maritime delimitation” (ibid., p. 312,
 ra. 157 ; emphasis added). It then further elaborated on this point by
  ting
   “[...] that to take into account the extent of the respective coasts of the
   Parties concerned does not in itself constitute either a criterion serv-
   ing as a direct basis for a delimitation, or a method that can be used
   to implement such delimitation. The Chamber recognizes that this
   concept is put forward mainly as a means of checking whether a
   provisional delimitation established initially on the basis of other
   criteria, and by the use of a method which has nothing to do with
   that concept, can or cannot be considered satisfactory in relation to
   certain geographical features of the specific case, and whether it is
   reasonable or otherwise to correct it accordingly. The Chamber’s views
   on this subject may be summed up by observing that a maritime
   delimitation can certainly not be established by a direct division of
   the area in dispute proportional to the respective lengths of the
   coasts belonging to the parties in the relevant area, but it is equally
   certain that a substantial disproportion to the lengths of those coasts
   that resulted from a delimitation effected on a different basis would
   constitute a circumstance calling for an appropriate correction.”
   (Ibid., p. 323, para. 185 ; emphasis added.)

168. In the present case, however the Court sees no such particularly
arked disparities between the relevant coasts of Ukraine and Romania


at would require it to adjust the provisional equidistance line at this
ncture. Although there is doubtless a difference in the length of the rel-
ant coasts of the Parties, the Court recalls that it previously (see para-
aph 100 above) excluded the coast of Karkinits’ka Gulf (measuring
me 278 km) from further consideration. The Court further notes that it
nnot disregard the fact that a good portion of the Ukrainian coast
hich it considers as relevant projects into the same area as other seg-
ents of the Ukrainian coast, thus strengthening but not spatially expand-
g the Ukrainian entitlement.



 9.2. The Enclosed Nature of the Black Sea and the Delimitations
                 Already Effected in the Region
 169. Romania notes that the enclosed nature of the Black Sea is also a
 evant circumstance as part of the wider requirement to take account of
e geographical context of the area to be delimited. According to
omania, in considering the equitable nature of an equidistance line, the
 eneral maritime geography” of the Black Sea must be assessed. In
omania’s view, this geographical factor is to be considered together
th any pre-existing delimitation agreements so that any new delimita-
 n should not dramatically depart from the method previously used in
e same sea between other riparian States in order not to produce an
equitable result.
 170. Romania contends that all the delimitation agreements concluded
 the Black Sea used equidistance as the method for the delimitation of
e continental shelf and the exclusive economic zones. Romania adds
at the lines of delimitation established by two of these agreements end
th provisionally defined segments, the definitive course of which is to
pend on subsequent discussions, and that the reason for this was that
e Parties wished to avoid prejudicing the interests of third parties and
at they had Romania in mind.
 171. Romania concludes that the Black Sea’s nature as an enclosed sea
 d its rather small size, together with the agreed solutions established in
e delimitation agreements in force, constitute a relevant circumstance
hich must be taken into account in the delimitation process for Roma-
a’s and Ukraine’s maritime areas.

                                   *
172. In Ukraine’s view, there is “no support in law or in the factual
ntext” for Romania’s arguments regarding the characterization of the
ack Sea as an enclosed sea and the importance of maritime delimitation
reements previously concluded between certain States bordering the
ack Sea. According to Ukraine, there is no special régime governing
limitations taking place in an enclosed sea simply because of this


 ture. Ukraine therefore considers that the enclosed character of the
ack Sea “is not by itself a circumstance which ought to be regarded as
 evant for delimitation purposes” and has no bearing on the method of
limitation to be applied in the present proceedings.
173. Ukraine further notes that in general terms, bilateral agreements
nnot affect the rights of third parties and, as such, the existing mari-
me delimitation agreements in the Black Sea cannot influence the present
 pute.

Ukraine states that only in a limited sense can the presence of third
ates in the vicinity of the area to be delimited be considered a relevant
 cumstance. However, this has nothing to do with the choice of the
tual method of delimitation or the character of a sea (whether or not it
enclosed). According to Ukraine, the presence of third States may be
 evant only to the extent that the Court may have to take precautions in
entifying a precise endpoint of the delimitation line so as to avoid
 tential prejudice to States situated on the periphery of the delimitation
ea.

                                 * *
174. The Court recalls that it has intimated earlier, when it briefly
scribed the delimitation methodology, that it would establish a provi-
 nal equidistance line (see paragraph 116 above). This choice was not
ctated by the fact that in all the delimitation agreements concerning the
ack Sea this method was used.
175. Two delimitation agreements concerning the Black Sea were
ought to the attention of the Court. The first agreement, the Agree-
ent concerning the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf in the Black
a, was concluded between Turkey and the USSR on 23 June 1978.
 me eight years later, they agreed, through an Exchange of Notes dated
  December 1986 and 6 February 1987, that the continental shelf
 undary agreed in their 1978 Agreement would also constitute the
 undary between their exclusive economic zones. The westernmost seg-
ent of the line, between two points with co-ordinates 43° 20′ 43″ N and
° 00′ 00″ E and co-ordinates 43° 26′ 59″ N and 31° 20′ 48″ E, respec-
 ely, remained undefined and to be settled subsequently at a convenient
me. After the dissolution of the USSR at the end of 1991, the 1978 Agree-
ent and the Agreement reached through the Exchange of Notes
mained in force not only for the Russian Federation, as the State con-
 uing the international legal personality of the former USSR, but also
e successor States of the USSR bordering the Black Sea, Ukraine being
 e of them.
176. The second agreement is the Agreement between Turkey and Bul-
ria on the determination of the boundary in the mouth area of the
 zovska/Mutludere River and delimitation of the maritime areas
tween the two States in the Black Sea, signed on 4 December 1997. The


awing of the delimitation line of the continental shelf and the exclusive
onomic zone further to the north-east direction, between geographical
 int 43° 19′ 54″ N and 31° 06′ 33″ E and geographical point 43° 26′ 49″ N
 d 31° 20′ 43″ E, was left open for subsequent negotiations at a suitable
me.

 177. The Court will bear in mind the agreed maritime delimitations
tween Turkey and Bulgaria, as well as between Turkey and Ukraine,
hen considering the endpoint of the single maritime boundary it is
ked to draw in the present case (see Section 10 below).

178. The Court nevertheless considers that, in the light of the above-
entioned delimitation agreements and the enclosed nature of the Black
a, no adjustment to the equidistance line as provisionally drawn is
 led for.

 9.3. The Presence of Serpents’ Island in the Area of Delimitation
179. The Parties disagree as to the proper characterization of Serpents’
and and the role this maritime feature should play in the delimitation
 the continental shelf and the Parties’ exclusive economic zones in the
ack Sea.
180. Romania maintains that Serpents’ Island is entitled to no more
an a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, and that it cannot be used as a
se point in drawing a delimitation line beyond the 12-mile limit. Roma-
a claims that Serpents’ Island is a rock incapable of sustaining human
bitation or economic life of its own, and therefore has no exclusive
onomic zone or continental shelf, as provided for in Article 121, para-
aph 3, of the 1982 UNCLOS. According to Romania, Serpents’ Island
 alifies as a “rock” because : it is a rocky formation in the geomorpho-
gic sense ; it is devoid of natural water sources and virtually devoid of
 l, vegetation and fauna. Romania claims that human survival on the
and is dependent on supplies, especially of water, from elsewhere and
at the natural conditions there do not support the development of eco-
 mic activities. It adds that “[t]he presence of some individuals, . . .
cause they have to perform an official duty such as maintaining a light-
 use, does not amount to sustained ‘human habitation’”.

181. Romania further argues that Serpents’ Island does not form part
 the coastal configuration of the Parties and that its coast cannot there-
re be included among Ukraine’s relevant coasts for purposes of the
limitation.
182. Romania nevertheless admits that in the present case the presence
  Serpents’ Island “with its already agreed belt of 12-nautical-mile
 ritorial sea” might be a relevant circumstance. It asserts that under
 ernational jurisprudence and State practice, small islands, irrespective of
eir legal characterization, have frequently been given very reduced or


   effect in the delimitation of the continental shelf, exclusive economic
ne or other maritime zones due to the inequitable effect they would
oduce. Thus, contends Romania, in the present case the provisional
uidistance line should be drawn between the relevant mainland coasts
  the Parties, with minor maritime formations only being considered at
 ater stage as possible relevant circumstances. Romania states that Ser-
nts’ Island, given its location, could be considered as a relevant circum-
  nce only in the sector of the delimitation area where the coasts are
 jacent (in other words, the provisional equidistance line would have to
  shifted so as to take into consideration the maritime boundary along
e 12-nautical-mile arc around Serpents’ Island, which “cannot generate
aritime zones beyond 12 nautical miles”). Owing to its remoteness from
e Ukrainian coast of Crimea, Serpents’ Island cannot, according to
omania, play any role in the delimitation in the area where the coasts
e opposite. In short, Romania considers that, although Serpents’ Island
ay qualify as a “special circumstance”, it should not be given any effect
yond 12 nautical miles.




                                    *
183. Ukraine argues that Serpents’ Island has a baseline which gener-
es base points for the construction of the provisional equidistance line.
 us, in Ukraine’s view, the coast of the island constitutes part of
kraine’s relevant coasts for purposes of the delimitation and cannot be
duced to just a relevant circumstance to be considered only at the sec-
 d stage of the delimitation process after the provisional equidistance
 e has been established.
184. According to Ukraine, Serpents’ Island is indisputably an “island”
 der Article 121, paragraph 2, of UNCLOS, rather than a “rock”.
kraine contends that the evidence shows that Serpents’ Island can read-
  sustain human habitation and that it is well established that it can sus-
 n an economic life of its own. In particular, the island has vegetation
 d a sufficient supply of fresh water. Ukraine further asserts that Ser-
nts’ Island “is an island with appropriate buildings and accommoda-
 n for an active population”. Ukraine also argues that paragraph 3 of
 ticle 121 is not relevant to this delimitation because that paragraph is
 t concerned with questions of delimitation but is, rather, an entitle-
ent provision that has no practical application with respect to a mari-
me area that is, in any event, within the 200-mile limit of the exclusive
onomic zone and continental shelf of a mainland coast.



                                  * *

 185. In determining the maritime boundary line, in default of any
limitation agreement within the meaning of UNCLOS Articles 74 and
 , the Court may, should relevant circumstances so suggest, adjust the
ovisional equidistance line to ensure an equitable result. In this phase,
e Court may be called upon to decide whether this line should be
 justed because of the presence of small islands in its vicinity. As the
  isprudence has indicated, the Court may on occasion decide not to
ke account of very small islands or decide not to give them their full
 tential entitlement to maritime zones, should such an approach have a
  proportionate effect on the delimitation line under consideration (see
  ntinental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, I.C.J.
  ports 1985, p. 48, para. 64 ; Maritime Delimitation and Territorial
uestions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Merits, Judg-
  nt, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 104, para. 219 ; Territorial and Maritime
 spute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nica-
gua v. Honduras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), pp. 751 et seq.,
 ras. 302 et seq.).
 186. The Court recalls that it has already determined that Serpents’
 and cannot serve as a base point for the construction of the provisional
uidistance line between the coasts of the Parties, that it has drawn in
e first stage of this delimitation process, since it does not form part of
e general configuration of the coast (see paragraph 149 above). The
ourt must now, at the second stage of the delimitation, ascertain whether
e presence of Serpents’ Island in the maritime delimitation area consti-
  es a relevant circumstance calling for an adjustment of the provisional
uidistance line.
 187. With respect to the geography of the north-western part of the
ack Sea, the Court has taken due regard of the fact that Ukraine’s
 ast lies on the west, north and east of this area. The Court notes that
   of the areas subject to delimitation in this case are located in the
clusive economic zone and the continental shelf generated by the
ainland coasts of the Parties and are moreover within 200 nautical
 les of Ukraine’s mainland coast. The Court observes that Serpents’
 and is situated approximately 20 nautical miles to the east of Ukraine’s
ainland coast in the area of the Danube delta (see paragraph 16
 ove). Given this geographical configuration and in the context of the
 limitation with Romania, any continental shelf and exclusive eco-
 mic zone entitlements possibly generated by Serpents’ Island could
 t project further than the entitlements generated by Ukraine’s main-
nd coast because of the southern limit of the delimitation area as
entified by the Court (see paragraph 114 and sketch-map No. 5, p. 102).
  rther, any possible entitlements generated by Serpents’ Island in an east-
  rd direction are fully subsumed by the entitlements generated by the
  stern and eastern mainland coasts of Ukraine itself. The Court also
 tes that Ukraine itself, even though it considered Serpents’ Island to
 l under Article 121, paragraph 2, of UNCLOS, did not extend the rele-
 nt area beyond the limit generated by its mainland coast, as a conse-


 ence of the presence of Serpents’ Island in the area of delimitation (see
etch-map No. 3, p. 92).
In the light of these factors, the Court concludes that the presence of
rpents’ Island does not call for an adjustment of the provisional equi-
 tance line.
In view of the above, the Court does not need to consider whether Ser-
nts’ Island falls under paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article 121 of UNCLOS
 r their relevance to this case.
188. The Court further recalls that a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea
 s attributed to Serpents’ Island pursuant to agreements between the
 rties. It concludes that, in the context of the present case, Serpents’
and should have no effect on the delimitation in this case, other than
at stemming from the role of the 12-nautical-mile arc of its territorial
a.

     9.4. The Conduct of the Parties (Oil and Gas Concessions,
               Fishing Activities and Naval Patrols)
 189. Ukraine suggests that State activities in the relevant area “consti-
  e a relevant circumstance which operates in favour of the continental
elf/EEZ claim line proposed by Ukraine”. Ukraine explains that it does
 t point to this conduct of the Parties in order to show the existence of
 ine arising from a tacit agreement or a modus vivendi. Instead, Ukraine
eks to assess the claims of the Parties in relation to their actual conduct.
  cording to Ukraine, it is significant that Romania’s activities, or lack
 them, are “fundamentally inconsistent” with Romania’s argument that
ere was a pre-existing maritime delimitation in the disputed area extend-
g out to “Point X”. Furthermore, Ukraine contends that the lack of
 y comparable operations by Romania in the disputed area is incom-
 tible with the position taken by Romania in the proceedings before the
ourt.

190. Ukraine argues that in 1993, 2001 and 2003 it licensed activities
 ating to the exploration of oil and gas deposits within the continental
elf/exclusive economic zone area claimed by Ukraine in the current
se. It asserts that the existence of these licences demonstrates that
kraine, both before and after the 1997 Additional Agreement, author-
 d activities relating to the exploration of oil and gas deposits in areas
 the continental shelf to which Romania lays claim in these proceed-
gs. It adds that prior to 2001, Romania never protested Ukraine’s oil
d gas activities in areas now claimed by Romania.

Ukraine concludes on this point that its oil-related activities are con-
tent with its delimitation line and should be taken into account together
th the other relevant circumstances, in particular the physical geo-
aphy, in order to achieve an equitable solution.



 191. Ukraine further argues that the exclusive economic zone and con-
 ental shelf boundary it claims furthermore corresponds generally to
e limit of the Parties exclusive fishing zones “as respected by both
omania and Ukraine in their administration of fishing in the north-west
 rt of the Black Sea”. Ukraine emphasizes that it was Ukraine and not
omania that has been active in policing that part of the area. Ukraine
ntends that Romania has neither demonstrated any interest in patrol-
 g the area nor has it objected to the fact that the Ukrainian coastguard
sumed the sole responsibility of intercepting illegal fishing vessels and,
hen possible, escorting them out of Ukraine’s exclusive economic zone
 d taking any other appropriate measures.

192. With regard to the notion of a critical date introduced by Roma-
a, Ukraine states that “even assuming that there was a critical date at
, and that the critical date would have a role to play in maritime
limitation, it is the date of Romania’s Application : 16 September
04”.

                                     *
193. Romania does not consider that State activities in the relevant
ea, namely licences for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas
 d fishing practices, constitute relevant circumstances. As a matter of
  al principle, effectivités or “State activities” cannot constitute an ele-
ent to be taken into account for the purposes of maritime delimitation.
omania notes that maritime effectivités can only be taken into account
they “reflect a tacit agreement” which might constitute a relevant cir-
mstance for delimitation. In order to come within this “exception” to
e general rule, it notes that only State activities prior to the critical date
ay be relevant and that they must be sufficient to prove that “a tacit
reement or modus vivendi exists”. According to Romania, the effectiv-
 s presented by Ukraine do not reveal the existence of a “de facto line”
  of a “pattern of conduct” proving one way or another an agreement
tween the Parties, or acquiescence by Romania relating in any way to
aritime delimitation. These activities cannot therefore constitute an ele-
ent “undermining Romania’s argument regarding the 1949 Procès-
 rbaux”. Romania concludes that it is evident from all the elements regard-
g the “State activities” in the disputed area that Ukraine has “failed to
monstrate that these State activities comply, in fact or in law, with the
cessary criteria that might transform them into a relevant circumstance
 le to have an impact on [the] delimitation”.


194. Romania further recalls that under the 1997 Additional Agree-
ent the two Parties clearly recognized in writing the existence of a dis-
 te regarding the maritime delimitation, and set the framework for
 ure negotiations to conclude a delimitation agreement. Romania adds


at the Agreement’s provisions regarding the existence of the dispute
 re a mere confirmation of a factual situation that had already existed
r a long time. Thus any oil-related practice occurring after the conclu-
 n of the 1997 Additional Agreement is, in its view, irrelevant in the
esent proceedings as the dispute had already crystallized by that date.

195. Romania concludes that Ukraine’s oil concessions practice offers
  support to the latter’s claimed delimitation for the following reasons.
rst, the area covered by the Ukrainian concessions “does not even
ughly correspond to its claim in the present proceedings”. Second, two
 the three licences were issued in 2001 and 2003, i.e., after the critical
te of 1997. Moreover, Romania consistently objected to Ukrainian
drocarbon activity.

196. With regard to fishing activities, Romania contests that the prac-
e of the Parties has any bearing on the maritime delimitation in the
esent case since neither Party economically depends on fisheries activi-
s in an area in which pelagic fish stocks are limited ; the practice
voked by Ukraine is recent and only covers a small part of the area in
 pute ; and it has always been challenged by Romania and has never
en recognized by third States. With regard to the naval patrols, Roma-
a submits, even if they could be considered a relevant circumstance,
od non, all the naval incidents reported by Ukraine are subsequent to
e critical date and as such are in any event irrelevant.



                                 * *
197. The Court recalls that it had earlier concluded that there is no
reement in force between the Parties delimiting the continental shelf
d the exclusive economic zones of the Parties (see paragraph 76 above).
It further notes that Ukraine is not relying on State activities in order
 prove a tacit agreement or modus vivendi between the Parties on the
e which would separate their respective exclusive economic zones and
ntinental shelves. It rather refers to State activities in order to under-
ne the line claimed by Romania.

198. The Court does not see, in the circumstances of the present case,
y particular role for the State activities invoked above in this maritime
limitation. As the Arbitral Tribunal in the case between Barbados and
inidad and Tobago observed,
  “[r]esource-related criteria have been treated more cautiously by the
  decisions of international courts and tribunals, which have not gen-
  erally applied this factor as a relevant circumstance” (Award of
  11 April 2006, RIAA, Vol. XXVII, p. 214, para. 241).



ith respect to fisheries, the Court adds that no evidence has been sub-
tted to it by Ukraine that any delimitation line other than that claimed
 it would be “likely to entail catastrophic repercussions for the liveli-
od and economic well-being of the population” (Delimitation of the
aritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of
merica), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 342, para. 237).

Since the Court does not consider that the above-mentioned State
tivities constitute a relevant circumstance in the present case, the issue
 critical date discussed by the Parties does not require a response from
e Court.

                     9.5. Any Cutting Off Effect
199. Romania contends that its proposed maritime boundary does
 t cut off the entitlements to the continental shelf and to the exclu-
  e economic zone of either Romania or Ukraine. The area attributed
   each Party does not encroach on the natural prolongation of the
her.
Romania argues that Ukraine’s delimitation line leads to a cut-off of
omania’s maritime entitlements, in particular in the northern sector of
   coast between the Sulina dyke and the Sacalin Peninsula. Romania
  tes that the delimitation line advocated by Ukraine would make it
tremely difficult for Romania to gain access to the port of Sulina and
e maritime branch of the Danube, which is an important route for the
  nsit of merchandise. In short, according to Romania, Ukraine’s
  imed line results in a dramatic curtailment of the maritime areas off
e Romanian coast, “as if the projection of every stretch of Ukraine’s
ast run unobstructed in every direction while there is no opposing or
 jacent Romanian territory”.

                                   *
 200. According to Ukraine, Romania’s line results in a two-fold cut-
   of Ukraine’s maritime entitlements. First, the maritime entitlements
  Serpents’ Island are dramatically truncated by allocating no continen-
   shelf and no exclusive economic zone to it. Second, Ukraine’s
 uth-facing mainland coast is deprived of the area to which it is legally
 titled : “[T]he end result is clearly inequitable and represents a funda-
ental encroachment on continental shelf and exclusive economic areas
at should appertain to Ukraine . . ..” Thus, Ukraine argues that
Romania’s versions of equidistance produces a marked cut-off effect of
e projection of Ukraine’s coastal front north of the land boundary”.
 oreover Ukraine asserts that

   “not only does Romania’s line encroach upon the extension or
   projection of Ukraine’s south-east-facing coast — the coast just


   above the land boundary — it also produces a cut-off effect on
   the projection of Ukraine’s south-facing coast lying beyond
   Odessa”.
 Ukraine argues that its line fully respects the principle of non-
croachment. It reflects the geographical fact that “Ukraine’s coast
onting the area to be delimited projects in essentially three directions
hile Romania’s coast projects basically in a single direction — south-
stwards”.

                                 * *
201. The Court observes that the delimitation lines proposed by the
 rties, in particular their first segments, each significantly curtail the
titlement of the other Party to the continental shelf and the exclusive
onomic zone. The Romanian line obstructs the entitlement of Ukraine
nerated by its coast adjacent to that of Romania, the entitlement
rther strengthened by the northern coast of Ukraine. At the same time,
e Ukrainian line restricts the entitlement of Romania generated by its
ast, in particular its first sector between the Sulina dyke and the Sacalin
ninsula.
By contrast, the provisional equidistance line drawn by the Court
oids such a drawback as it allows the adjacent coasts of the Parties to
oduce their effects, in terms of maritime entitlements, in a reasonable
d mutually balanced way. That being so, the Court sees no reason to
just the provisional equidistance line on this ground.


          9.6. The Security Considerations of the Parties
 202. Romania asserts that there is no evidence to suggest that the
 limitation advanced by it would adversely affect Ukraine’s security
  erests, including Serpents’ Island, which has a belt of maritime space
  12 nautical miles.
 In Romania’s view, Ukraine’s delimitation line runs unreasonably
ose to the Romanian coast and thus encroaches on the security interests
  Romania.

                                   *
203. Ukraine claims that its line in no way compromises any Roma-
an security interests because Ukraine’s delimitation line accords to
omania areas of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone off its
astline. In this regard Ukraine refers to “the predominant interest
kraine has for security and other matters as a function of its geographi-
  position along this part of the Black Sea on three sides of the coast”
 d maintains that Ukraine has been the only Party to police the area
 d to prevent illegal fishing and other activities in that area. According


Ukraine, its claim is consistent with this aspect of the conduct of the
rties, whereas Romania’s claim is not.


                                  * *
204. The Court confines itself to two observations. First, the legitimate
curity considerations of the Parties may play a role in determining the
 al delimitation line (see Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/
alta), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1985, p. 42, para. 51). Second, in the
esent case however, the provisional equidistance line it has drawn sub-
  ntially differs from the lines drawn either by Romania or Ukraine. The
ovisional equidistance line determined by the Court fully respects the
  itimate security interests of either Party. Therefore, there is no need to
 just the line on the basis of this consideration.



                    10. THE LINE OF DELIMITATION

205. The Court takes note of the fact that Article 1 of the 2003 State
 rder Régime Treaty situates the meeting point of the territorial seas of
e Parties at 45° 05′ 21″ N and 30° 02′ 27″ E. This suffices for the fixing
 the starting-point.
Romania and Ukraine have both indicated, in considerable detail, the
urse that their respective delimitation lines would then follow beyond
e point fixed by Article 1 of the 2003 State Border Régime Treaty (see
 ragraph 13 above and sketch-map No. 1, p. 69). The Court notes that
e Parties’ positions differ in this regard.
206. The delimitation line decided by the Court, for which neither the
award end of the Sulina dyke nor Serpents’ Island is taken as a base
 int, begins at Point 1 and follows the 12-nautical-mile arc around Ser-
nts’ Island until it intersects with the line equidistant from Romania’s
 d Ukraine’s adjacent coasts, as defined above ; from there, it follows
at line until it becomes affected by base points on the opposite coasts of
omania and Ukraine. From this turning point the delimitation line runs
ong the line equidistant from Romania’s and Ukraine’s opposite coasts
 r the course of the equidistance line see paragraph 154 above).


207. Romania maintains that the endpoint of the delimitation line is
uated at co-ordinates 43° 26′ 50″ N and 31° 20′ 10″ E (Point Z). It
serts that drawing the delimitation line up to Point Z does not affect
y possible entitlements of third countries to maritime areas, as Point Z
 “practically the point equidistant to the Romanian, Ukrainian and
 rkish coasts, and is farther to the Bulgarian coast”.
208. Ukraine argues that no endpoint of the delimitation should be


ecified, so as to avoid any encroachment on possible entitlements of
rd States ; the line would therefore end in an arrow. The line advocated
 Ukraine continues from the point identified by it as Point 3 along the
 muth 156 until it reaches the point where the interests of third States
tentially come into play.
209. The Court considers that the delimitation line follows the equi-
 tance line in a southerly direction until the point beyond which the
erests of third States may be affected.


                  11. THE DISPROPORTIONALITY TEST

 210. The Court now turns to check that the result thus far arrived at,
  far as the envisaged delimitation line is concerned, does not lead to
 y significant disproportionality by reference to the respective coastal
ngths and the apportionment of areas that ensue. This Court agrees
 th the observation that
   “it is disproportion rather than any general principle of proportion-
   ality which is the relevant criterion or factor . . . there can never
   be a question of completely refashioning nature . . . it is rather a
   question of remedying the disproportionality and inequitable effects
   produced by particular geographical configurations or features”
   (Anglo-French Continental Shelf Case, RIAA, Vol. XVIII, p. 58,
   para. 101).

 211. The continental shelf and exclusive economic zone allocations are
 t to be assigned in proportion to length of respective coastlines. Rather,
e Court will check, ex post facto, on the equitableness of the delimita-
 n line it has constructed (Delimitation of the maritime boundary
tween Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, RIAA, Vol. XIX, pp. 183-184,
 ras. 94-95).
 212. This checking can only be approximate. Diverse techniques have
 the past been used for assessing coastal lengths, with no clear require-
ents of international law having been shown as to whether the real
astline should be followed, or baselines used, or whether or not coasts
 ating to internal waters should be excluded.
 213. The Court cannot but observe that various tribunals, and the
ourt itself, have drawn different conclusions over the years as to what
 parity in coastal lengths would constitute a significant disproportion-
 ty which suggested the delimitation line was inequitable and still
quired adjustment. This remains in each case a matter for the Court’s
 preciation, which it will exercise by reference to the overall geography
  the area.
 214. In the present case the Court has measured the coasts according
  their general direction. It has not used baselines suggested by the
 rties for this measurement. Coastlines alongside waters lying behind


 lfs or deep inlets have not been included for this purpose. These meas-
 ements are necessarily approximate given that the purpose of this final
  ge is to make sure there is no significant disproportionality.

 215. It suffices for this third stage for the Court to note that the ratio
  the respective coastal lengths for Romania and Ukraine, measured as
 scribed above, is approximately 1:2.8 and the ratio of the relevant area
 tween Romania and Ukraine is approximately 1:2.1.

 216. The Court is not of the view that this suggests that the line as
 nstructed, and checked carefully for any relevant circumstances that
 ght have warranted adjustment, requires any alteration.



 12. THE MARITIME BOUNDARY DELIMITING THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
                AND EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES


 217. The Court observes that a maritime boundary delimiting the con-
  ental shelf and exclusive economic zones is not to be assimilated to a
 ate boundary separating territories of States. The former defines the
mits of maritime zones where under international law coastal States
 ve certain sovereign rights for defined purposes. The latter defines the
  ritorial limits of State sovereignty. Consequently, the Court considers
 at no confusion as to the nature of the maritime boundary delimiting
 e exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf arises and will thus
mploy this term.
 218. The line of the maritime boundary established by the Court
 gins at Point 1, the point of intersection of the outer limit of the terri-
 rial sea of Romania with the territorial sea of Ukraine around Ser-
 nts’ Island as stipulated in Article 1 of the 2003 State Border Régime
 eaty (see paragraph 28 above). From Point 1 it follows the arc of the
 -nautical-mile territorial sea of Serpents’ Island until the arc intersects
  Point 2, with co-ordinates 45° 03′ 18.5″ N and 30° 09′ 24.6″ E, with a
  e equidistant from the adjacent coasts of Romania and Ukraine, plot-
d by reference to base points located on the landward end of the Sulina
 ke and the south-eastern tip of Tsyganka Island. The maritime bound-
 y from Point 2 continues along the equidistance line 5 in a south-
 sterly direction until Point 3, with co-ordinates 44° 46′ 38.7″ N and
 ° 58′ 37.3″ E (Point A of the provisional equidistance line), where the
 uidistance line becomes affected by a base point located on the Sacalin
 ninsula.



  For the description of the entire course of the equidistance line, see paragraph 154
 ove.


From Point 3 the maritime boundary follows the equidistance line in a
uth-easterly direction to Point 4, with co-ordinates 44° 44′ 13.4″ N and
° 10′ 27.7″ E (Point B of the provisional equidistance line), where the
uidistance line becomes affected by the base point located on Cape
 rkhankut on Ukraine’s opposite coast and turns south-south-east.
om Point 4 the boundary traces the line equidistant from the opposite
asts of Romania and Ukraine until Point 5, with co-ordinates
° 02′ 53.0″ N and 31° 24′ 35.0″ E) (Point C of the provisional equidis-
nce line), which is controlled by base points on the Sacalin Peninsula
  the Romanian coast and Capes Tarkhankut and Khersones on the
krainian coast, from where it continues along the equidistance line in a
utherly direction starting at a geodetic azimuth of 185° 23′ 54.5″ until
e maritime boundary reaches the area where the rights of third States
ay be affected (see sketch-maps Nos. 8 and 9, pp. 132-133).


The geographical co-ordinates for Points 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the single
aritime boundary set out in this paragraph and in the operative clause
 e paragraph 219) are given by reference to WGS 84 datum.

219. For these reasons,
THE COURT,
Unanimously,
Decides that starting from Point 1, as agreed by the Parties in Article 1
 the 2003 State Border Régime Treaty, the line of the single maritime
 undary delimiting the continental shelf and the exclusive economic
nes of Romania and Ukraine in the Black Sea shall follow the 12-
utical-mile arc of the territorial sea of Ukraine around Serpents’ Island
 til Point 2 (with co-ordinates 45° 03′ 18.5″ N and 30° 09′ 24.6″ E) where
e arc intersects with the line equidistant from Romania’s and Ukraine’s
jacent coasts. From Point 2 the boundary line shall follow the equidis-
nce line through Points 3 (with co-ordinates 44° 46′ 38.7″ N and
° 58′ 37.3″ E) and 4 (with co-ordinates 44° 44′ 13.4″ N and
° 10′ 27.7″ E) until it reaches Point 5 (with co-ordinates 44° 02′ 53.0″ N
d 31° 24′ 35.0″ E). From Point 5 the maritime boundary line shall con-
 ue along the line equidistant from the opposite coasts of Romania and
kraine in a southerly direction starting at a geodetic azimuth of
5° 23′ 54.5″ until it reaches the area where the rights of third States may
  affected.
