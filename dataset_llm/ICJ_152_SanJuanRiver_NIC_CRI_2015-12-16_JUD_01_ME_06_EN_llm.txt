                         5. While I concur with the majority’s conclusion that Costa Rica ought
                      to have produced an EIA in the Construction of a Road case (Judgment,
                      paras. 104‑105 and 160‑162), I feel the present Judgment offers a welcome
                      opportunity to expand upon the present state of the law surrounding
                      EIAs, and to offer insight as to how the body of law governing such
                      instruments may be complemented so as to provide clearer guidance to
                      nation-States contemplating large‑scale public works projects that con-
                      tain a prospect of transboundary impacts.
                         6. As I shall discuss at greater length below, the obligation to produce
                      an EIA presently arises not only under general international law, but has
                      also been codified by various international treaties and other legal instru-
                      ments. Regrettably, despite the current widespread acceptance of the
                      necessity to conduct an EIA where there is a risk of transboundary harm,
                      public international law presently offers almost no guidance as to the spe-

                         9. Over approximately the past half‑century remarkable progressive
                      steps have been taken with regard to international environmental law
                      since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was
                      held at Stockholm in 1972 (“Stockholm Conference”) 2. One of the rea-
                      sons for this evolution is scientific development, in so far as increased
                      technological capacity for scientific inquiry has heightened the ability of

                      mankind to ascertain the harm it is committing against its own natural
                      habitat. This is demonstrated most obviously through a greatly intensi-
                      fied focus on climate change over the past twenty years 3.
                         10. Some of the driving forces behind the advent and growing accep-
                      tance of the need to conduct EIAs are the concomitant rise in other inter-
                      national environmental law doctrines, such as the principle of sustainable
                      development, the principle of preventive action, global commons, the pre-
                      cautionary principle, the polluter pays principle and the concept of trans-
                      boundary harm.

                                            Principle of Sustainable Development
                         11. The principle of sustainable development has been a driving force
                      in international environmental law for several decades. Indeed, the Stock-
                      holm Conference culminated in the issuance of a comprehensive report
                      recognizing, inter alia, that environmental management is designed for
                      the purpose of facilitating comprehensive planning that takes into account
                      the side effects of human activities on the environment 4. Chapter I of that
                      report consisted of a declaration (“Stockholm Declaration”) containing
                      26 principles.
                         12. Principle 1 of the Stockholm Declaration implicitly embodied the
                      principle of sustainable development when it stated in relevant part that :
                               “Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate
                            conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life
                            of dignity and well‑being, and he bears a solemn responsibility to
                            protect and improve the environment for present and future genera-
                            tions.”
                      The actual term “sustainable development” was coined in a report pre-
                      pared in 1987 by the World Commission on Environment and Develop-
                      ment 5, commonly known as the “Brundtland Report” 6, and has figured
                      prominently in numerous international treaties, legal instruments and
                      cases applying international environmental law ever since.

                         13. The notion of sustainable development is said to embody the balan­
                      cing of two ideas. The first is the idea of granting priority to essential needs
                      such as food, clothing, shelter, and the second is the idea of limitations
                      imposed by the ability of the environment to meet such future needs 7.
                      As the term implies, the industrial development and scientific progress

                      taking place in the world must be done in a manner that takes into
                      account the impact of such activities on the environment. In fact, in the
                      Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project Judgment, this Court discussed this bal-
                      ancing act in the following terms :
                               “Throughout the ages, mankind has, for economic and other rea-
                            sons, constantly interfered with nature. In the past, this was often
                            done without consideration of the effects upon the environment.
                            Owing to new scientific insights and to a growing awareness of the
                            risks for mankind — for present and future generations — of pursuit
                            of such interventions at an unconsidered and unabated pace, new
                            norms and standards have been developed, set forth in a great number
                            of instruments during the last two decades. Such new norms have to
                            be taken into consideration, and such new standards given proper
                            weight, not only when States contemplate new activities but also when
                            continuing with activities begun in the past. This need to reconcile
                            economic development with protection of the environment is aptly
                            expressed in the concept of sustainable development.” 8


                      The principle of sustainable development is thought of as an underlying
                      concern in all negotiations and discussions of the international commu-
                      nity relating to the environment 9.

                                                Principle of Preventive Action
                         14. In addition to sustainable development, the principle of preventive
                      action is another pillar of modern international environmental law 10.
                      Whereas certain principles of international environmental law such as
                      sustainable development focus on balancing the often competing needs of
                      industrial development and environmental protection, the principle of
                      preventive action, by contrast, focuses solely on the minimization of envi-
                      ronmental damage 11. As the term would imply, the preventive action
                      called for must be done prior to the occurrence of any environmental
                      damage. This Court has recognized the importance of the principle of
                      preventive action in the Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project Judgment, where
                      it stated that :
                            “[t]he Court is mindful that, in the field of environmental protection,

                         15. Central to the principles of sustainable development and preven-
                      tive action is the core idea of common custody over the earth’s resources
                      and that stewardship over the environment cannot end at the border of a
                      nation-State. These values of good neighbourliness and co‑operation 13
                      are based on the maxim of sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas 14. Indeed, a
                      logical corollary of the foundational principle under international law
                      that each nation is sovereign over its own territory, is that if one nation
                      deleteriously affects the territory of another, certain obligations and/or
                      liabilities might arise.
                         16. One expression of this imperative can be found in Principle 24
                      of the Stockholm Declaration, which urges the need for such co‑­operation :
                      
                              “International matters concerning the protection and improvement
                            of the environment should be handled in a co-operative spirit by all
                            countries, big and small, on an equal footing.
                              Co-operation through multilateral or bilateral arrangements or
                            other appropriate means is essential to effectively control, prevent,
                            reduce and eliminate adverse environmental effects resulting from
                            activities conducted in all spheres, in such a way that due account is
                            taken of the sovereignty and interests of all States.” 15

                                                     Precautionary Principle
                         17. The precautionary principle aims to provide guidance in develop-
                      ment and application of international environmental law where there is
                      scientific uncertainty 16. Although the precautionary principle is an impor-
                      tant one, its status in international law is still evolving. Its core ethos,
                      however, is captured by Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration :
                              “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach
                            shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where

                         18. There exists some confusion in the international community with
                      regard to this principle as it has been provided for in many conventions
                      though in different language. Certain conventions couch this principle in
                      terms similar to progressive realization of enhanced scientific capabilities

                      overlapping principles when it comes to international environmental law,
                      with distinct approaches and objectives, that converge upon the com-
                      mon conclusion that nation-States owe certain obligations toward the
                      environment, particularly in a transboundary context. When nation-
                      States transgress these obligations vis‑à‑vis their neighbours, the resultant
                      consequences may fall under the rubric of transboundary harm.

                         21. There exists no single definition of transboundary harm under
                      international law. Though the Draft Principles relating to prevention of
                      transboundary harm by the International Law Commission (“ILC”) 28 do
                      contain a definition of this concept, the idea of “risk of causing significant
                      transboundary harm” is quite vague. Harm as per the ILC must be phys-
                      ical and is limited to persons, property or the environment 29. However,
                      the accompanying commentary does provide some clarity in this regard
                      and explains that the idea of risk and harm are not to be isolated, but
                      thought of in conjunction with each other :

                               “For the purposes of these articles, ‘risk of causing significant trans-
                            boundary harm’ refers to the combined effect of the probability of
                            occurrence of an accident and the magnitude of its injurious impact.
                            It is, therefore, the combined effect of ‘risk’ and ‘harm’ which sets the
                            threshold.” 30

                      The ILC also gives guidance on the meaning of the word “significant” by
                      way of its commentary :
                                  “The term ‘significant’ is not without ambiguity and a determina-
                               tion has to be made in each specific case. It involves more factual
                               considerations than legal determination. It is to be understood that
                               ‘significant’ is something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the
                               level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’. The harm must lead to a real detri-
                               mental effect on matters such as, for example, human health, industry,
                               property, environment or agriculture in other States. Such detrimen-
                               tal effects must be susceptible of being measured by factual and objec-
                               tive standards.” 31
                         22. Transboundary harm has been succinctly described by this Court
                      as “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used
                      for acts contrary to the rights of other States” 32. However, a review of the
                      various authorities in which the concept is discussed reveals four common
                      factors present in cases of transboundary environmental harm : firstly, the
                      harm must be a result of human activity ; secondly, the harm must result
                      as a consequence of that human activity ; thirdly, there must be trans-
                      boundary effects on a neighbouring nation-State ; and fourthly, the harm
                      must be significant or substantial 33.
                         23. The requirement of a country contemplating a public works project
                      that poses a risk of transboundary harm to produce an EIA can thus be
                      seen as a tangible manifestation of these collective requirements that has
                      gained increasing recognition amongst the community of nations. The
                      Goals and Principles of Environmental Impact Assessment promul-
                      gated by the United Nations Environment Programme (“UNEP”)
                      in 1987, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly that
                      same year (“UNEP Principles”) demonstrate that the rise in the impor-
                      tance of ­conducting EIAs has been commensurate with the increase in the
                      possibility of transboundary harm emanating from activities carried out
                      by neighbouring nation-States 34. Moreover, when the United Nations
                      Conference on Environment and Development, popularly known
                      ­
                      as the “Earth Summit”, was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, it issued

                      elucidation as to the practical implications of this responsibility.
                         28. Finally, in the Pulp Mills Judgment of 2010, upon which the pres-
                      ent Judgment has placed considerable emphasis, this Court noted :

                            “a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance
                            among States that it may now be considered a requirement under
                            general international law to undertake an environmental impact
                            assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity
                            may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in
                            particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the
                            duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be con-
                            sidered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to
                            affect the régime of the river or the quality of its waters did not under-
                            take an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of
                            such works.


                            �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                                The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment
                            must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. More­
                            over, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout
                            the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the
                            environment shall be undertaken.” 46
                      However, in the same section of that Judgment, the Court opined that
                            “it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its
                            domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project,
                            the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required
                            in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the pro-
                            posed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment
                            as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an
                            assessment”. 47
                         29. Thus, we see that while the Pulp Mills Judgment elevated the prac-
                      tice of conducting an EIA to an imperative under general international
                      law when certain preconditions are met, at the same time it allowed for a
                      renvoi to domestic law in terms of the procedure and content required
                      when carrying out such an assessment. In view of the paucity of guidance
                      from the Court and other sources of international law, it could plausibly
                      be argued there are presently no minimum binding standards under pub-

                      lic international law that nation-States must follow when conducting
                      an EIA.

                         30. One reason for the lack of clarity as to what exactly a nation-State
                      must do under international law to discharge its burden of conducting an
                      EIA under these various authorities could be that the extent of the obliga-
                      tions arising under such instruments are difficult to define with precision.
                      Some have suggested that this lack of precision is attributable to the fact
                      that such assessments are a policy instrument 48. Whatever the reason, the

                        41. This part outlines certain minimum standards to be followed in
                      cases where there is no domestic legislation that guides an EIA. These
                      minimum standards reflect in large part my affinity toward the ambitious
                      approach taken in the Espoo Convention. However, rather than using the
                      sometimes onerous obligations arising from that treaty as the requisite
                      minimum standard for every country, in every context, I have instead laid
                      out what, in my considered opinion, ought to be adopted as the lowest
                      common denominator while conducting an EIA. These minimum stan-
                      dards may be broken down into procedural and substantive obligations.
                      In my opinion, procedural obligations of an EIA would relate to when
                      and under what circumstances such an assessment must be carried out,
                      whereas substantive obligations refer to what must be done by a nation-
                      State when conducting an EIA.


                                                Procedural Obligations
                         42. Procedural obligations arising out of the obligation to perform an
                      EIA arise out of questions of when an EIA is to be conducted. Presently,
                      an EIA is required to be conducted when there is “risk of significant
                      adverse impact” (Judgment, para. 167). A nation-State contemplating a
                      project might claim that the risk of harm is not significant and therefore
                      there exists no obligation to conduct an EIA. However, to avoid the pos-
                      sibility that countries may abuse their discretion in labelling certain activ-
                      ities as environmentally benign, I suggest that the best approach to take
                      lies in the Espoo Convention, which lays down certain types of industries
                      for which there is an automatic requirement to conduct an EIA if the said
                      activities are being proposed near an international border. To that end, I

                      804 	 certain activities and construction of a road (sep. op. bhandari)

                      recall my observation above that Appendix 1 to the Espoo Convention
                      lists a number of activities that require an EIA per se 56. However, the fact
                      that a project does not appear on this list does not mean it cannot be
                      subject to an EIA. For instance, there might be other types of activities
                      not contemplated within Appendix 1 of the Espoo Convention, but which
                      might still produce dangerous pollutants or effluents as a by‑product.
                      Those activities must also be recognized as harmful, thus giving rise to
                      EIA obligations. To this end, Appendix III of the Espoo Convention con-
                      tains general criteria to assist in the determination of the environmental
                      significance of various activities.

                         43. Once it is established that a certain activity requires that an EIA be
                      carried out, nation-States may invoke certain exemptions that would
                      relieve them of their obligation to conduct an EIA. Such pleas may
                      include natural disasters, nuclear disasters, terrorism, internal disturbance
                      or emergency, among others. If such a claim is made by a nation it has to
                      be well substantiated and the burden of proof, which would lie with the
                      country proposing the project, must be high.
                         44. It should be remembered that even private companies might pro-
                      pose projects near an international border. It is then the responsibility of

                      the country in whose territory the project is being proposed to provide an

                      state of international environmental law is lamentably silent on the exact
                      procedural steps and substantive content that are required when a situa-
                      tion of potential transboundary harm gives rise to the obligation of a
                      nation-State to produce an EIA. In my view, it is incumbent upon the
                      international community to come together and develop a sound, prag-
                      matic and comprehensive régime of EIA that rectifies this problem. The
                      suggestions I have made during the course of this opinion are in keeping
                      with the principles of sustainable development, preventive action and
                      global commons and reflect the bedrock international law values of con-
                      sensus, co‑operation and amicable relations between nations.

                      be reflected in a comprehensive international convention with global
                      reach, given the fact that the concept of EIA is a general principle of
                      international law applicable to all nation-States.
