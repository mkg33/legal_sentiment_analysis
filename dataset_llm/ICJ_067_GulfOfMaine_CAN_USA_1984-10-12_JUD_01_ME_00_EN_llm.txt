appropriate considerations.

42. However, up to this point the Chamber’s definition and description
of the delimitation area has only brought out aspects inherent in physical
geography. Political geography has been employed solely for the purpose
of noting the location within the area in question of the international
boundary terminus between the United States and Canada. It had merely
to be made clear that the boundary between the two States — whose
historical development, recounted in the pleadings, is apparently without
influence on the issues to be decided — follows in its final stretches the
winding course of the Saint-Croix River, ending in the estuary of that river,
following which it continues as far as its terminal point in the Grand
Manan Channel. It is this latter point which marks the angle between the
long and short sides of the rectangle which, as we have seen, can be
inscribed within the Gulf of Maine.

43. It should, moreover, be added that the Chamber has only had in
mind physical geography to the extent that its purpose is to describe the
present-day aspect of the land and water surfaces of the globe. In order to
grasp not only the outward aspects but the whole of the characteristic
features of the delimitation area, there still remain to be examined various
aspects of what lies below the surface, rather under the heading of geo-
morphology and ecology than that of geology.

44. With regard to geology, the Chamber must observe that, despite the
efforts made to argue either that there are geological affinities between the
platforms of Georges Bank and Nova Scotia, or that there is a geological
continuity between Georges Bank and Massachusetts, both Parties recog-
nize that the geological structure of the strata underlying the whole of the
continental shelf of North America, including the Gulf of Main area, is
essentially continuous. They are in fact in agreement that geological fac-
tors are not significant in the present case.

45. As regards the geomorphological aspects, the conclusion that can be
drawn from the studies undertaken and taken into careful consideration by
the Parties in their pleadings is, in sum, the unity and uniformity of the
whole sea-bed, as regards both the underlying shelf of the Gulf of Maine
proper, and the shelf below the ocean beyond the Gulf, right up to the
continental margin, its edge, rise and slope. The continental shelf of the


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 274

whole of this area is no more than an undifferentiated part of the conti-
nental shelf of the eastern seaboard of North America, from Newfound-
land to Florida. According to generally accepted scientific findings, this
shelf is a single continuous, uniform and uninterrupted physiographical
structure, even if here and there it features some secondary characteristics
resulting mainly from glacial and fluvial action. In this wider context the
continental shelf of the area relevant to the present proceedings may be
defined as the natural prolongation of the land mass around the Gulf of
Maine ; neither Party disputes the fact that there is nothing in this single
sea-bed, lacking any marked elevations or depressions, to distinguish one
part that might be considered as constituting the natural prolongation of
the coasts of the United States from another part which could be regarded
as the natural prolongation of the coasts of Canada. Of course, within this
single, uniform expanse of sea-bed it is possible to pick out features
described as shelves, banks, basins, channels, and the Parties have given a
detailed description of these, occasionally — and very cautiously — seeking
in the existence of one or other of these geomorphological features some
support for their respective positions. These are ultimately a somewhat
insignificant body of rugosities, even if they do influence, and are probably
in fact produced by, the water circulation. But the bathymetric differences
between one spot and another — differences which do not show up on a
drawing unless there is great vertical exaggeration — are not such as to cast
doubt on the soundness of the basic finding that the sea-bed of the
delimitation area, as of all the neighbouring area — part of which is covered
with thick sedimentary layers potentially rich in hydrocarbon resources —
does not show any trace of any natural differentiation as between the
respective continental platforms of the two Parties.

46. Even the most accentuated of these features, namely the Northeast
Channel, does not have the characteristics of a real trough marking the
dividing-line between two geomorphologically distinct units. It is quite
simply a natural feature of the area. It might also be recalled that the
presence of much more conspicuous accidents, such as the Hurd deep and
Hurd Deep Fault Zone in the continental shelf which was the subject of the
Anglo-French arbitration, did not prevent the Court of Arbitration from
concluding that those faults did not interrupt the geological continuity of
that shelf and did not constitute factors to be used to determine the method
of delimitation. To return to the sea-bed of the area of delimitation in the
present case, no really abrupt change in the normal declivity of the sea-bed
is found before the vicinity of the hypotenuse of the triangle within which
the end-point of the present delimitation is supposed to be located. It is
only thereabouts that the continental slope descends more or less in
parallel with the general direction of the mainland coast, abruptly at first
as far as the 1,000 metres isobath, after which the “rise” continues down-


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 275

ward, though much more gradually, towards the 2,000 metres isobath and
beyond, towards the abyssal plain.

47. The situation in the present case as regards the sea-bed of the
delimitation area is therefore different from the situation that may prevail
in areas where a natural separation does exist from the factual viewpoint
between the respective continental platforms of the Parties in dispute.
From that angle, the present case is closer to other concrete cases, includ-
ing most recently that of the delimitation of the continental shelf between
Tunisia and Libya, i.e., situations characterized, as the Court pointed out

natural boundary capable of serving as a basis for carrying out a delimi-
tation of the kind requested of the Chamber.

56. It must, however, be emphasized that a delimitation, whether of a
maritime boundary or of a land boundary, is a legal-political operation,
and that it is not the case that where a natural boundary is discernible, the
political delimitation necessarily has to follow the same line. But in any
event the problem does not arise in the present instance, since, as we have
noted, there are no geological, geomorphological, ecological or other fac-
tors sufficiently important, evident and conclusive to represent a single,
incontrovertible natural boundary.

57. At this stage the Chamber might consider whether the definition of
the outer limits of the area within which it is called upon to delimit the
single maritime boundary between Canada and the United States. and the
description of its physical aspects as regards both surface and depth, ought
not to be followed by taking into consideration other aspects also. What
the Chamber has in mind here is the human environment, and more
particularly its socio-economic conditions.

58. The Parties did take this course ; they even dealt with those aspects in
extenso. They exchanged lengthy argument on whether the fishermen of
one nationality or the other were first on the scene in the waters of the area.
They argued over the importance of the catches of the fisheries, particu-
larly those of Georges Bank, for the port activity, ship-building, food
industry and dependent industries of the land areas around the Gulf of
Maine, and of the neighbouring areas. They also argued as to their role for
the food supplies of their populations and for their exports. Comparative
analyses were made of the respective importance of the resources drawn


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 278

from those fisheries for what was called the one-dimensional economy of
Lunenburg County and for the diversified, urbanized economy of Mas-
sachusetts. On either side, statistics, tables and graphics were produced in
this connection. On one side, gloomy predictions were put forward regard-
ing the consequences for the Nova Scotian economy of exclusion of Can-
adian fishermen from the Georges Bank fisheries ; the other side empha-
sized the deleterious effect on the conservation of the Bank’s fish stocks
that would result from failure to ensure a system of single-State manage-
ment. The Chamber is bound to point out that the Parties sometimes gave
the impression of over-emphasizing these prospects, for it must not be
forgotten that the institution by these two North American States of a
200-mile exclusive fishery zone only dates back eight years, and that
previously in that zone, which at the time was still high seas, American and
Canadian fishing boats plied their trade alongside large high-sea fishing
fleets from distant countries. And the eviction of the latter — the justifi-
cation given for which was the need to avoid the over-fishing to which their
presence contributed — was carried out without apparent concern for the
repercussions on certain coastal areas and industries of the countries in
question.

59. However, the crux of the matter lies elsewhere. It should be empha-
sized that these fishing aspects, and others relating to activities in the fields
of oil exploration, scientific research, or common defence arrangements,
may require an examination of valid considerations of a political and
economic character. The Chamber is however bound by its Statute, and
required by the Parties, not to take a decision ex aequo et bono, but to
achieve a result on the basis of law. The Chamber is, furthermore, con-
vinced that for the purposes of such a delimitation operation as is here
required, international law, as will be shown below, does no more than lay
down in general that equitable criteria are to be applied, criteria which are
not spelled out but which are essentially to be determined in relation to
what may be properly called the geographical features of the area. It will
only be when the Chamber has, on the basis of these criteria, envisaged the
drawing of a delimitation line, that it may and should — still in conformity
with a rule of law — bring in other criteria which may also be taken into
account in order to be sure of reaching an equitable result.


60. The dispute between Canada and the United States, now referred to
the Chamber for judgment, is of recent origin — although the United States
has suggested that the dispute could be traced back to the attitude of the
Parties at the time of the Truman Proclamations in 1945. By these pro-
clamations, published on 28 September 1945, the United States asserted its


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 279

jurisdiction over the natural resources of the continental shelf under the
high seas contiguous to its coasts, and announced the establishment of
conservation zones for the protection of fisheries in certain areas of the
high seas contiguous to the United States. The United States emphasizes
that these Proclamations were shown to Canada in advance of their being
issued and Canada made no objection to them, either then or since ; and
that the United States made it clear at the time that, in its view, the
continental shelf extended to the 100-fathoms depth line. The Chamber
will return to this question in paragraphs 153 ff., below.

61. Infact, this dispute first developed in relation to the continental shelf
of what is now the delimitation area, and did so as soon as exploration for
hydrocarbon resources was begun on each side, particularly in the subsoil
of certain parts of Georges Bank. Exploration for hydrocarbon resources
of the continental shelf in the Gulf of Maine area began in the 1960s. The
United States ratified the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental
Shelf in 1961 and became a party when it came into force in 1964. Canada,
confronted by constitutional difficulties related to its federal structure, did
not ratify the Convention until 1970, so that at the time its first exploration
permits were issued, it was not a party. The Canadian Government
accompanied its ratification by a declaration which the United States did
not accept, but which did not prevent the entry into force of the Conven-
tion as between the two countries. In 1953, the United States had enacted
the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the primary text governing activi-
ties on its continental shelf, but because the status of Georges Bank as the
principal fishing bank on the East Coast raised important environmental
concerns, exploration proceeded slowly and development has been defer-
red. The first United States permits for geophysical exploration in this area
were issued in 1964. On the Canadian side, the first regulations authorizing
oil and gas operations in off-shore areas were issued in 1960 (Canada Oil
and Gas Regulations), and in 1964 the Canadian Government began to
issue exploration permits in the Gulf of Maine area. Canada has made it
clear that when issuing such permits, in the absence of any delimitation of
the continental shelf agreed with the United States, it treated the equi-
distance line as a working boundary, drawing its inspiration from Article 6
of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, at least to the extent of
including, in any permits issued extending to areas beyond that line, a
caveat to the effect that the permit was issued “subject to the lands
contained in the grid areas being Canadian lands”. Before the Chamber,
Canada described the delimitation line which it had in mind, and consid-
ered that it had respected, as a “strict equidistance” line. There is no need
to pass comment upon that definition for the time being ; the Chamber will
come back to the point when considering directly the various methods that
could in principle be applied to the delimitation.


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 280

62. The question of the line used by the United States as a working limit
in the direction of Canada for the issue of permits in this area is contro-
verted between the Parties. Canada has claimed that a de facto equidistance
line was used by the United States Bureau of Land Management (the
so-called “BLM line”) or by companies to whom United States permits
were granted (the so-called “company median line”). The United States
has denied that these lines had any official status or even existence. The
Chamber will return to this point in connection with the arguments as to
the relevance of the conduct of the Parties (Section V, paragraphs 126 ff.,
below).

63. In 1965, the issue of Canadian exploration permits gave rise to an
exchange of correspondence, initially between a Mr. Hoffman, whose
position was that of Assistant Director for Lands and Minerals of the
United States Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the
Interior, and a Mr. Hunt, whose position was Chief of the Resources
Division of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources
of Canada. The correspondence began with a request by the Bureau of
Land Management for information as to the location of Canadian oil and
gas exploratory permits. Reliance has been placed by Canada on this
correspondence as constituting or indicating acquiescence by or estoppel
against the United States ; however the Chamber will not examine these
exchanges at this stage, or discuss the significance attributed to them
during the case by Canada, which has been contested by the United States.
The Chamber will come back to them when examining the state of the law
in force between the Parties. It could not, however, be said that a dispute
had at that time already crystallized between the two States.

64. On 16 August 1966, the United States Embassy in Ottawa requested
information from the Canadian Department of Mines and Technical Sur-
veys as to Canadian hydrocarbon exploration on the Pacific Coast and in
the Gulf of Maine area. On 30 August 1966 a reply from the Under-
Secretary of the Canadian Department of External Affairs outlined the
relevant Canadian policies and practices and enclosed a map showing the
sea-bed area covered by the Canadian permits, but not indicating whether
any activity by Canadian permittees was in progress or imminent in that
area. After certain diplomatic consultations and contacts in 1966-1968,
including a United States aide-mémoire of 10 May 1968 suggesting that
negotiations be opened and that there be a temporary suspension of
activities on the northern half of Georges Bank, the United States on 5
November 1969 presented a diplomatic Note requesting a moratorium on
mineral explorations and exploitation on Georges Bank. That Note con-
tained a formal reservation of United States rights and stated that :

“until the exact location of the United States-Canada Continental
Shelf boundary is agreed upon, the United States cannot acquiesce


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 281

in any Canadian authorization of exploration or exploitation of the
natural resources of the Georges Bank Continental Shelf”.

On 1 December 1969, Canada replied observing that the United States had
not previously protested against Canadian oil and gas permits. While
accepting the proposal that negotiations on the delimitation of the conti-
nental shelf should be undertaken as suggested by the United States,
Canada declined to agree to a moratorium. The Chamber considers that it
was at this stage — i.e., after the American diplomatic Note of 5 November
1969 refusing to acquiesce in any authorization given by Canada to explore
or exploit the natural resources of Georges Bank, and after Canada’s reply
of 1 December 1969, refusing, inter alia, to agree to any kind of moratorium
— that the existence of the dispute became clearly established. It may
however be useful to note once again that, at that time, it was still only a
dispute relating to the continental shelf.

65. On 21 February 1970, the United States Government recorded in the
Federal Register that the United States had protested against Canadian
authorizations relating to Georges Bank. Formal negotiations between the
United States and Canada on the continental shelf boundary began in
Ottawa on 9 July 1970. The Canadian position was that no special cir-
cumstances existed in the area and the boundary should thus be the
equidistance line, as contemplated by Article 6 of the 1958 Geneva Con-
vention on the Continental Shelf to which Canada had just become a party.
When ratifying the Convention, Canada had appended a declaration to the
effect that, in its view :

“the presence of an accidental feature such as a depression or channel
in a submerged area should not be regarded as constituting an inter-
ruption in the natural prolongation”.

The United States formally objected to this declaration on 16 July 1970.
The United States position in the negotiations asserted the inequitableness
of the equidistance line in view of the existence of special circumstances
and that the boundary should follow the Northeast Channel. No drilling
activities were authorized by either State at this time, but seismic surveys
were carried out on Georges Bank by United States companies in 1968,
1969 and 1975.

66. Various exchanges of diplomatic correspondence took place in 1974.
On 18 January 1974, the United States informed Canada (among others) of
United States legislation concerning the American lobster (homarus ameri-
canus), based upon Article 2, paragraph 4, of the 1958 Geneva Convention
on the Continental Shelf (concerning the living resources of the shelf), and
gave notice that fishing for American lobster by foreign nationals on the
United States continental shelf was prohibited. The boundary indicated by


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 282

the United States for purposes of enforcement of this legislation was the
100-fathom contour of Georges Bank, and this line has been referred to in
these proceedings as the “lobster line”. In September 1974, however, in
order to improve the prospects for negotiation, the United States informed
Canada that it would not enforce the requirements of the lobster law
against Canadian fishermen. The lobster-protection legislation remained
in force until it was superseded by the declaration of the general 200-mile
fishery zone (paragraph 68, below). On 17 September 1974 Canada for-
mally notified the United States of its reservation concerning continental
shelf exploration activities under a permit (No. OCS E-1-74) issued by the
United States to Digicon Inc. In reply, the Department of State referred to
its Note of 5 November 1969, and asserted that the areas subject to the
permit in question were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

67. On 15 May 1975, the United States notified Canada of its plans to
issue a Call for Nominations — the first step towards the granting of oil and
gas leases — in respect of areas on Georges Bank ; by a Note dated 3 June
1975, Canada took the position that it could not acquiesce in acts by the
United States intended to constitute an exercise of jurisdiction in respect of
any part of the continental shelf under Canadian jurisdiction. In 1976, 206
tracts of sea-bed on Georges Bank were selected for “intensive study” in
the process of preparing the draft environmental impact statement before
leasing could be carried out ; 28 of these tracts were on the northeastern
part of Georges Bank, in the area claimed as Canadian continental shelf.
Canada protested on 2 February 1976, and on 10 February 1976 the
United States restated its position that all the tracts being studied were on
the United States continental shelf ; however the disputed tracts were
temporarily withdrawn in December 1976 from the proposed sale of leases,
in order to avoid making the negotiations more difficult. The United States
has explained that, under its policy of restraint, the leases granted were
restricted to the undisputed portions of Georges Bank. At this time there
were also exploratory negotiations in progress, beginning on 15 December
1975 and continuing into 1976, both on continental shelf delimitation and
co-operative fisheries arrangements and on zones of shared hydrocarbon
resources ; but no basis for solution of the boundary problem was
found.

68. The situation thus remained more or less unchanged when, around
the turn of the year 1976-1977, some new events occurred and added to the
continental shelf dimension of the dispute a new dimension concerning the
waters and their living resources. Early in 1977, basing themselves on the
consensus meanwhile achieved at the Third United Nations Conference on
the Law of the Sea, the two States, at an interval of three months, each
proceeded to establish a 200-mile fishery zone off its shores, the United


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 283

States on 13 April 1976, with the adoption of the Fishery Conservation and
Management Act which came into force on 1 March 1977, and Canada on
1 November by the publication of the text of a proposed Order in Council
under the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act, effective 1 January 1977.
This Order defined the limits for the future Canadian zone ; a notice in the
United States Federal Register on 4 November 1976 stated the limits of the
United States 200-mile fishery zone and continental shelf in areas bor-
dering Canada. Thus the dispute which had previously been confined to
the continental shelf boundary issue was automatically enlarged to include
the issue of the boundary to be established in the superjacent waters. That
only made the negotiations between the two Parties more arduous. Later,
on 10 March 1983, in the course of the present proceedings, the United
States was to proclaim an exclusive economic zone, which coincided with
the previously constituted fishing zone, but this did not of course modify
the terms of the Special Agreement.

69. Negotiations at this time were concentrated on the establishment of
interim fishery arrangements, and on 24 February 1977 an Interim Recip-
rocal Fisheries Agreement was signed, and was provisionally implemented
pending its entry into force on 26 July 1977. This Agreement provided for
the preservation of the “existing patterns” of fisheries of the east and west
coast of each State, both within and beyond the boundary regions ; on the
Atlantic coast, the method used in the Agreement was to incorporate the
1976 quotas set by the International Commission for the Northwest
Atlantic Fisheries (ICNAF) as the ceiling for trans-boundary fishing
privileges. The Agreement expired at the end of 1977, but its terms and
conditions were maintained de facto pending negotiations on its renewal ;
agreement was reached for its renewal in an amended form, but as a result
of the occurrence of a number of serious disputes during its provisional
implementation, the new Agreement never entered into force. On 2 June
1978 its provisional implementation was suspended, and trans-boundary
fishing ceased. The two States have however maintained an interim régime
of flag-State enforcement procedures in the boundary regions along the
lines of the 1977 Agreement, first pending the entry into force of a 1979
Fisheries Agreement (paragraph 75, below), and subsequently, when that
Agreement failed to come into force, pending the present proceedings. On
27 July 1977 special negotiators were appointed by the Governments to
report on the principles of a comprehensive settlement on maritime boun-
daries and related matters as appropriate ; a joint report was presented in
October 1977.

70. It is important to stress that, within the dual dimension character-
izing the dispute between the two States following the proclamation by
each of them of an exclusive fishery zone, the United States attributed
importance in particular to the fishing aspect, whilst Canada long contin-
ued to give priority to the original aspect, i.e., the continental shelf. It was


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 284

therefore from this double perspective, involving both the delimitation of
the continental shelf and, more especially, its new intention to set up a
200-mile exclusive fishery zone, that the United States formalized its
position by publishing in the Federal Register of 4 November 1976 the
co-ordinates of a line delimiting both the continental shelf and the fishery
zones. This line generally corresponded to the line of greatest depth ; it
carefully separated, in the inner zone of the Gulf of Maine, the fishing
grounds of the northeastern part from those of the southwestern part, and
in the outer zone, Browns Bank from Georges Bank. Skirting the outer
edge of the latter Bank, it thus reached the slope of the continental margin
via the Northeast Channel. It is easy to discern the dominant idea underly-
ing this United States line.

71. Canada, on the other hand, having published on 1 November 1976
the co-ordinates of a line which, as has been seen, was described as strictly

sale on 31 January 1978 by the United States, should be withdrawn from
the sale ; these tracts lay to the south-west of the original equidistance line
claimed by Canada, but on the Canadian side of the revised line of 3
November 1977, which had not yet been made public. On 28 January 1978
the deletion of the tracts in question from the sale was announced, as being
“within the area claimed by Canada to be subject to negotiation between
the United States and Canada”, but the United States made it clear in a
Note of 3 February 1978 that it would not give any credence or recognition
to the new Canadian position. On 15 September 1978, Canada made public
its claim of 3 November 1977, by way of the publication in the Canada
Gazette of a proposed Order in Council extending the Canadian fishing
zone, which Order was published in final form on 25 January 1979. By a
Note of 20 September 1978, the United States reiterated its view that the
new Canadian claim was without foundation ; it asserted in the Note that
Georges Bank is a natural prolongation of United States territory, that in
view of the special circumstances in the Gulf of Maine area, the equidis-
tance line would not be in accordance with equitable principles, and that
there was no justification in international law for discounting the effect of
Cape Cod or Nantucket Island in determining the maritime boundary. The
United States objected further that expansion of the Canadian claim in the
midst of negotiations was not in keeping with the obligations of States
under the 1958 Geneva Convention, and indicated that it would continue
to exercise fisheries jurisdiction in the area of the expanded claim.

75. Since the submission, on 15 October 1977, of the joint report of the
two special negotiators (approved by both Governments on 21 October
1977), negotiations between them had continued, though only slowly and
with difficulty. In March 1979 agreement was reached to submit for the
approval of the Governments of Canada and the United States a package
of two linked treaties : the Treaty to Submit to Binding Dispute Settlement
the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine area, and
the Agreement on East Coast Fisheries Resources ; these two instruments
were signed on 29 March 1979, and it was also agreed that further
exchanges of diplomatic correspondence on the legal merits of the posi-


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 287

tions of the two Governments were not necessary in view of the package
proposed.

76. The two treaties were drawn so as to be interdependent, being
expressed to come into force together ; however ratification of them both
was not achieved. On 6 March 1981 the Fisheries Agreement was with-
drawn by the President of the United States from consideration by the
United States Senate, and proposals were made to Canada for amendment
of the boundary settlement Treaty so as to enable it to be put into force
independently. The United States Government gave the Canadian Gov-
ernment assurances that if the boundary settlement Treaty were ratified,
the United States would refrain from enforcement activities against Can-
adian fishing vessels in all areas claimed by Canada until the boundary was
established by adjudication. Instruments of ratification of the boundary
settlement Treaty were exchanged on 20 November 1981, and on 25
November 1981 the special agreement for the reference of the case to a
chamber of the Court was notified to the Registry.

77. The description, in terms of geographic co-ordinates, of the line
proposed has constituted part of the formal submissions of each Party (see
paragraphs 12 and 13, above). The Canadian line, which Canada describes,
as it did the one preceding it, as an equidistance line, consists of a line
constructed almost entirely from the nearest points of the baselines from
which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. In this instance, this
means solely islands, rocks or low-tide elevations. An exception is however
made for the basepoints selected on the coast of Massachusetts, which have
been transferred from the outer end of the peninsula of Cape Cod and
Nantucket Island, much further to the west, to the eastern end of the Cape
Cod Canal. This is the line which Canada notified to the United States on 3
November 1977 and made public in the Canada Gazette on 15 September
1978. The line which the United States puts forward as the appropriate
boundary is somewhat more complex in its construction, though its jus-
tification is simple : it is presented as a perpendicular to the general
direction of the coast from the starting-point agreed upon by the Parties,
adjusted to take account of the relevant circumstances of the area, i.e., to
avoid the splitting of fishing banks. It differs from the “Northeast Channel
line” — the line adopted by the United States on 4 November 1976 which,
as the United States has explained, generally followed the line of deepest
water through the Gulf of Maine basin and the Northeast Channel, and
was approximately equidistant between the 100-fathom depth contours
there. According to its authors, this initial line was based upon the
“equidistance/special circumstances” rule of Article 6 of the 1958 Geneva
Convention, taking into account, as special circumstances, the configura-
tion of the coasts, the location of the land boundary, the position of the
fishing banks in the area, and the Northeast Channel. In contrast, the


GULF OF MAINE (JUDGMENT) 288

perpendicular to the general direction of the coast, now advanced by the
United States, has been substituted for the line of 1976, firstly because the
earlier line was not as broad a claim as that to which the United States
believed it is legally entitled ; and secondly because of the considerable
development of the law between 1976 and the date of filing of the Mem-
orials. In reply to a question by a member of the Chamber, the United
States further drew attention to explanations of the line given in Depart-
ment of State Memoranda of 1976/1977, and explained that the Northeast
Channel line — which followed the line of deepest water from the inter-
national boundary terminus to the Atlantic Ocean — gave more effect to
the geological and geomorphological circumstances of the Gulf of Maine
area than proved, in the light of the Court’s 1982 Judgment on the Con-
tinental Shelf (Tunisia/ Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), to be warranted.

78. In sum, one may say that the two successive lines put forward by
Canada were both proposed delimitation lines drawn primarily with the
continental shelf in mind, even if they are both single boundaries which are
supposed to apply to the fishery zone also. The Two United States delimi-
tation lines, on the countrary, are both proposals for single-boundary lines
drawn up initially on the basis of different considerations, but both treat-
ing the fishery régime as essential. In any case, it is certain that the gap
between the Parties’ respective positions has become noticeably wider
between the moment when the dispute appeared in their relations and the
moment of its being referred for judgment to the Chamber. There was no
sight of any rapprochement during the proceedings, except for a certain
tendency on each side to stress the merits of its initial proposal and to
emphasize the intentions that had lain behind it. The submissions formu-
lated by both Canada and the United States at the end of the oral pro-
ceedings only served to confirm the line which each Party had presented in
its initial written submissions.
