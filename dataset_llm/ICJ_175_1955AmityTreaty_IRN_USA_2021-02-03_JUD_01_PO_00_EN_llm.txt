                    11 	                 1955 treaty of amity (judgment)

                    United States to withdraw from JCPOA does not preclude it from relating to
                    interpretation and application of Treaty of Amity — A dispute may relate to cer-
                    tain acts that fall within ambit of more than one instrument — The Court cannot
                    support argument that subject‑matter of Iran’s claims relates exclusively to
                    JCPOA and not to Treaty of Amity — First preliminary objection to jurisdiction
                    cannot be upheld.


                       Second preliminary objection to jurisdiction: “third country measures” — The
                    Court must ascertain whether acts of which Applicant complains fall within provi-
                    sions of treaty containing compromissory clause — “Third country measures”
                    objection does not concern all of Iran’s claims but only majority of them — Were
                    the Court to uphold second objection to jurisdiction the proceedings would not be
                    terminated — Disagreement between the Parties about relevance of concept of
                    “third country measures” — Disagreement between the Parties as regards territo-
                    rial scope and ambit of provisions of Treaty of Amity allegedly breached by
                    United States — Fact that some impugned measures directly targeted third States,
                    their nationals or companies, does not automatically exclude them from ambit of
                    Treaty of Amity — Second preliminary objection relates to the scope of certain
                    obligations relied upon by Applicant — Also raises legal and factual questions
                    which are properly a matter for the merits — Second preliminary objection to
                    jurisdiction cannot be upheld.

                       Admissibility.
                       Preliminary objection to admissibility of Iran’s Application: alleged abuse of
                    process — Claim based on valid title of jurisdiction can be rejected on ground of
                    abuse of process only in exceptional circumstances — No such exceptional circum-
                    stances in present case — Preliminary objection to admissibility rejected.

                      Article XX, paragraph 1 (b) and (d), of Treaty of Amity does not affect the
                    Court’s jurisdiction but affords a possible defence on the merits — Treaty of Amity
                    does not preclude application of measures “relating to fissionable materials”
                    under Article XX, paragraph 1 (b) — Similarly, it does not preclude application of
                    measures deemed necessary to protect a State’s “essential security interests”
                    ­
                    under Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) — A decision concerning these matters requires
                    analysis of issues of law and fact that should be left to the merits — Arguments
                    based on these provisions cannot provide basis for preliminary objections but may
                    be presented at the merits stage — Preliminary objections based on Article XX,
                    paragraph 1 (b) and (d), of Treaty of Amity rejected.
