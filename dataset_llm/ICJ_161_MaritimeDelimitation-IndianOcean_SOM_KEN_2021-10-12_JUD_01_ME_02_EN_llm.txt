                  1. I agree with most of the conclusions reached by the Court in the
                present Judgment.
                  2. I am of the opinion that, as the Court notes in paragraph 89 of the
                Judgment, Somalia has not acquiesced to the maritime boundary claimed
                by Kenya along the parallel of latitude and that, consequently, there is no
                boundary that has already been agreed between the Parties. I therefore
                voted in favour of subparagraph 1 of the operative clause, which states
                that there is no tacit agreement between the Parties in this regard.
                  3. Since it was thus for the Court itself to delimit the maritime areas
                belonging respectively to Somalia and Kenya, it proceeded to do so, in
                my view correctly on the majority of points.

                    4. I have no objection to the manner in which the Court fixed the starting-­
                point of the maritime boundary (in paragraphs 93 to 98). Nor do I dis-
                 agree with the section of the Judgment concerning the delimitation of the
                 territorial sea (paras. 99-118). I agree with the course of the median line,
                whose co-­ordinates are given in paragraph 117 and which is depicted in
                sketch-map No. 5 (p. 249). I therefore voted in favour of subpara-
                graphs 2 and 3 of the operative clause.
                    5. As regards the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and the
                 continental shelf within 200 nautical miles, I fully agree with the Court
                applying the “three-stage” methodology which is now well established in
                the jurisprudence, reaffirming on this occasion that while this method is
                not mandatory, it is nonetheless applied as a rule unless there are specific
                factors rendering it inappropriate in a given case — there being no such
                factors in this instance.
                    6. As for the manner in which the Court applies the three-stage
                ­methodology in this case, I have no criticism to make with regard to the
                 first and third stages. The construction of the provisional equidistance
                 line (paras. 142-146) is beyond reproach in my view, and I agree with the
                 co‑ordinates of that line as indicated in paragraph 146 and its course as
                 depicted in sketch-map No. 9 (p. 261). I also accept that the delimitation
                 line adopted by the Court, after adjustment of the provisional equidis-
                 tance line, is not invalidated by the final disproportionality test, since it
                 does not lead to any “significant disproportionality” between the ratio of
                 the lengths of the Parties’ respective relevant coasts and the ratio of the
                 relevant areas attributed to each of them.

                  7. Where I disagree is on the second stage of the process, the purpose
                of which is to ascertain whether there are factors requiring an adjustment

                of the provisional equidistance line and, if so, to make an appropriate
                adjustment taking account of the relevant circumstances (paras. 147-174).
                It is because I disagree with the choice, as the maritime boundary, of the
                “adjusted line” depicted in sketch-map No. 11 (p. 271) that I regretfully
                had to vote against subparagraph 4 of the operative clause, which deter-
                mines the course of the single maritime boundary within 200 nautical
                miles, and, consequently, against subparagraph 5, which extends that
                boundary beyond 200 nautical miles, along the same geodetic line, in
                order to delimit the continental shelf.
                   8. Before explaining why I disagree, I will state briefly that I have no
                objection to the way in which the Judgment deals with the specific ques-
                tions of law and fact relating to the determination of the boundary
                between the Parties on the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles,
                and that I also support the Court’s rejection (and the reasoning underpin-
                ning that rejection) of Somalia’s submissions requesting the Court to
                declare Kenya’s international responsibility engaged on account of that
                State’s violation of certain international obligations (which is why I voted
                in favour of subparagraph 6 of the operative clause).

                   9. Thus, my sole point of disagreement with the Judgment — though it
                relates to a matter of substance — concerns the Court’s examination of
                the circumstances warranting — or not — an adjustment of the provi-
                sional equidistance line, an examination that is described in paragraphs 147
                to 174 and constitutes the second stage of the traditional method.
                   10. The Court considered that an adjustment of the provisional equi-
                distance line by shifting it to the north — thus to the benefit of Kenya —
                was justified by the concavity of the East African coastline as a whole,
                from Somalia to Tanzania. It is argued that, owing to this concavity,
                Kenya, as a middle State, would be disadvantaged if a strict equidistance
                line were to be used to establish the maritime boundaries. More specifi-
                cally, if equidistance lines were adopted as the maritime boundaries
                between both Kenya and Somalia and Kenya and Tanzania, it would
                result in a cut-off effect for Kenya. Sketch-map No. 10 (p. 269) is intended
                to illustrate this situation by showing that “[t]he provisional equidistance
                line between Somalia and Kenya progressively narrows the coastal pro-
                jection of Kenya, substantially reducing its maritime entitlements within
                200 nautical miles” (para. 169), even if no account is taken of the bound-
                ary line agreed by means of a treaty between Kenya and Tanzania along
                the parallel of latitude.

                   11. I am not convinced.
                   I would first observe that, in order to detect a concavity that produces
                a cut-off effect justifying an adjustment of the equidistance line, the Court
                is obliged to move a considerable distance away from the relevant coasts,
                adopting what could be termed a “macro-­geographical” approach, i.e. by
                considering the concavity of the coastline “in a broader geographical con-
                figuration” than that of the States concerned (para. 164). Yet, in the case

                concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and
                Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea intervening), the Court
                made the following statement, which in my view could not be clearer:
                         “The Court does not deny that the concavity of the coastline may
                      be a circumstance relevant to delimitation, as it was held to be by the
                      Court in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases and as was also so held
                      by the Arbitral Tribunal in the case concerning the Delimitation of the
                      Maritime Boundary between Guinea and Guinea-­Bissau, decisions on
                      which Cameroon relies. Nevertheless the Court stresses that this can
                      only be the case when such concavity lies within the area to be delim-
                      ited.” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 445, para. 297.)
                   It is difficult, in the present case, to claim that the concavity of the
                coastline lies “within the area to be delimited”. An examination of the
                relevant coasts of Somalia and Kenya — as depicted, for example, in
                sketch-map No. 8 (p. 256) which precedes paragraph 141 of the Judg-
                ment — reveals no particular concavity, which, moreover, the Judgment
                acknow­ledges.

                   12. I accept that it is reasonable, in some cases, to take account not
                only of the coastal configuration of the two States parties to the proceed-
                ings, but also that of a third State (or several third States), when it is clear
                that those coasts may, by the projections they generate, have significant
                effects on the equity of the delimitation to be made between the two
                States directly concerned. This is the case when there are three adjacent
                States along a concave coastline, and the middle State, hemmed in by the
                two other States, finds itself deprived of a large part of its maritime areas
                by the strict application of the equidistance method. In such a situation,
                even if the case submitted for judicial or arbitral decision is between only
                two of the three States concerned, it would be difficult for the court or
                arbitration body not to take account of the configuration of the third
                State’s coastline. The Court is right, in this regard, to refer to the prece-
                dents of the Bangladesh/Myanmar and Bangladesh v. India cases, decided
                respectively by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and an
                arbitral tribunal (paragraph 166 of the Judgment).
                   13. But even if we agree to move away from the directly relevant coasts
                in order to take a general view of the region, by looking at the coastline
                as a whole from Somalia, in the north, to Tanzania, or even Mozam-
                bique, in the south, it is plain to see that the situation of Kenya, which is
                located more or less in the middle of this group, is in no way analogous
                to that of Bangladesh, which is enclaved between India and Myanmar
                within a deep concave bay, or to that of the German coastline between
                the Danish and Dutch coasts, such that the Court considered them
                together in the North Sea Continental Shelf case.

                   In the present case, there is no conspicuous concavity in the configura-
                tion of Somalia’s coast to the north of Kenya, or in the way in which the
                Somalian and Kenyan coastlines extend in broadly the same general
                direction. It is the coast of Tanzania to the south, and this coast alone,
                which is somewhat concave.
                   14. It is true that it is not the concavity of the coasts in itself that moti-
                vates the adjustment of the equidistance line carried out by the Court, but
                the “cut-off” effect it would produce for Kenya. However, the jurispru-
                dence clearly and consistently states that a cut-off effect is not in itself
                sufficient to justify the shifting of the provisional equidistance line; this is
                understandable, since any delimitation between two States whose mari-
                time projections overlap inevitably creates a cut-off effect for one of them
                or, more often than not, both.

                   It is only when the cut-off effect is “serious” or “significant” that there
                is cause to correct — or mitigate — it by adjusting the equidistance line,
                as shown by the jurisprudence rightly cited by the Court in paragraph 170
                of the Judgment.
                   15. I very much doubt that the “serious” criterion is met in this case.
                Sketch-map No. 10 (p. 269), which shows the maritime areas that would
                appertain to Kenya if both its northern and southern maritime boundar-
                ies were fixed using the equidistance method, does not in my view show a
                sufficiently serious cut-off to justify an adjustment on the scale of that
                adopted by the Court, which shifts the equidistance line between Somalia
                and Kenya northwards by approximately a third of the distance between
                that line and the parallel of latitude claimed by Kenya, without any valid
                legal basis, as the agreed boundary. Furthermore, it is patently clear that
                the cut-off effect for Kenya results mainly from the configuration of its
                coast in relation to that of Tanzania to the south, and in particular from
                the presence of the Tanzanian island of Pemba, which the Court mentions
                in paragraph 168 of the Judgment. Somalia thus finds itself deprived of
                part of its maritime rights for a cause that should normally be relevant
                only in the context of the delimitation of a maritime boundary between
                two other States.
                   The circumstances of the case did not, in my view, justify the adjust-
                ment made by the Court, if indeed any shift in the equidistance line were
                warranted, and I cannot support the solution that it adopted.
