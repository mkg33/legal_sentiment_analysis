   1. I have voted in favour of the decision in the Judgment to the effect
that sovereignty over Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and
South Cay lies with the Republic of Honduras (subparagraph (1) of the
operative clause), as it is my view — in the light of the oral arguments, as
well as the evidence and information submitted by the Parties — that
these islands, all lying north of the 15th parallel, belong to Honduras for
three reasons : (a) Honduras possesses a legal title to the islands pursu-
ant to the uti possidetis juris position in 1821, which applies as between
the Parties ; (b) the post-colonial effectivités exercised by Honduras à
titre de souverain over the islands and in the territorial sea around them
and the absence of effectivités of Nicaragua ; and (c) Nicaragua’s acqui-
escence in Honduras’s sovereignty over the islands until the belated asser-
tion of a claim in the Memorial filed by the Applicant in the present
proceedings on 21 March 2001.
   2. Thus, in my view, the legal basis for Honduras’s sovereignty over
the islands is threefold. However, according to the reasoning set out in
the Judgment, Honduran sovereignty over the islands is based solely on
the post-colonial effectivités. As is explained in that reasoning, the major-
ity deems that the evidence is insufficient to allow for ascertaining which



of the two Parties inherited the Spanish title to the islands by operation
of the principle of uti possidetis juris, and that there is no proof of any
acquiescence by Nicaragua in Honduras’s sovereignty over the islands. I
disagree with the negative findings of the majority in these respects,
whilst agreeing that Honduras also has sovereignty over the islands based
on the post-colonial effectivités.
   3. It follows that the discussion below concerning the “territorial dis-
pute” is the statement of a separate, rather than a dissenting, opinion.
The reason why the present opinion is a “dissenting opinion” lies else-
where, namely in the “maritime delimitation”, because on this latter sub-
ject I am in utter disagreement, save on one point, with the majority’s
decisions and supporting reasoning, and this explains my vote against
subparagraphs (2) and (3) of the operative clause of the Judgment.

   4. The point in question, and I acknowledge its importance, concerns
the delimitation of the territorial sea surrounding the islands effected by
the Judgment, as this delimitation is in full accord with the relevant pro-
visions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in
force between the Parties. Had there been a separate vote on that section
of the single maritime boundary, I would have voted in favour of it. Thus
my vote against subparagraph (3) as a whole must be understood as a
qualified one, since I fully endorse the route of the delimitation line
around the islands.
   5. Finally, I voted in favour of subparagraph (4) of the operative
clause, as I am of the opinion, given the circumstances of the case, that
the best solution is for the Parties to agree on the course of the delimita-
tion line in the territorial seas between the endpoint of the land boundary
established by the 1906 Arbitral Award and the starting-point of the sin-
gle maritime boundary determined by the present Judgment.

                       I. THE TERRITORIAL DISPUTE

A. The Applicable Law for Determining Sovereignty over the Disputed
        Islands : Uti Possidetis Juris, Post-colonial Effectivités
                           and Acquiescence
   6. Confronted with repeated attempts by the Applicant to have the
island dispute settled through the application of the law of the sea, the
Judgment rightly reaffirms that the question of sovereignty over the four
islands in dispute, located north of the 15th parallel, must be resolved in
accordance with international law on the acquisition of land territories.
And, in that field, it is no longer possible to question the role of the prin-
ciple of uti possidetis juris, as the dispute over the islands can be traced
back to the decolonization which took place in 1821 in Central America,
when the Republic of Nicaragua and the Republic of Honduras pro-
claimed their independence from Spain. Simple geographic adjacency,

   7. According to the Judgment, the post-colonial effectivités demon-
strated by Honduras attest to the intent and will of the Respondent to act
à titre de souverain and constitute in the present case a sufficient and
effective manifestation of State authority over the four islands. In con-
trast, the Court found no evidence of any intent or will on the part of
Nicaragua to act à titre de souverain with regard to the disputed islands,
nor any evidence of the effective exercise or demonstration of its author-
ity over any one of the four islands concerned.
   8. The Judgment’s finding is based on generally accepted principles
articulated in the Permanent Court’s decision in the case concerning the
Legal Status of Eastern Greenland, and on the present Court’s recent
jurisprudence on the subject of small islands that are intermittently
inhabited, uninhabited or of slight economic importance (Qit’at Jaradah ;
Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan).
   9. I subscribe wholeheartedly to that finding, since the evidence pre-
sented to the Court of post-colonial effectivités concerning the islands
weighs heavily in favour of Honduras. While the various evidentiary
offerings are variable in number and probative value, as a whole they
provide ample proof of Honduras’s intent and will to act à titre de sou-
verain and of the effective exercise and manifestation of its authority over
the islands and in the adjacent waters. Confronted with the Respondent’s
post-colonial effectivités, the Applicant was unable to prove the existence
of a single Nicaraguan post-colonial effectivité in respect of the contested
islands.

       C. Honduras’s Uti Possidetis Juris in the Disputed Islands
   11. Upon independence, the Parties freely accepted the uti possidetis
juris principle, which had been formulated a few years earlier following a
political initiative by Simon Bolivar. It was supposed to act as an objec-
tive criterion to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the territorial issues
already outstanding at the time or which could arise in the future for the
new Republics. Both the Republic of Honduras and the Republic of


                 DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                 785

Nicaragua declared themselves to be successor States to the Spanish
Crown with regard to the former Spanish colonial administrative unit on
whose territory they were respectively established — namely the former
province of Honduras for the Republic of Honduras and the former
province of Nicaragua for the Republic of Nicaragua — initially as con-
stituent Republics of the Federal Republic of Central America. The dis-
solution of the Federation in 1838-1840 did not lead to any territorial
changes for either of the Parties to the present case.

   12. The province of Honduras and the province of Nicaragua were
both, prior to 1821, part of the same, broader colonial administrative
unit, the Captaincy-General of Guatemala, which in turn was part of the
Vice-Royalty of New Spain (Mexico). As was observed in the Arbitral
Award made on 23 December 1906 by Alfonso XIII, the King of Spain,
in the border dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua :

    “the Spanish provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua were gradually
    developing by historical evolution in such a manner as to be finally
    formed into two distinct administrations (intendencias) under the
    Captaincy-General of Guatemala by virtue of the prescriptions of
    the Royal Regulations of Provincial Intendants of New Spain of
    1786, which were applied to Guatemala and under whose régime
    they came as administered provinces till their emancipation from
    Spain in 1821” (United Nations, Reports of International Arbitral
    Awards (RIAA), Vol. XI, p. 112).
   13. On succeeding to independence, the Republic of Honduras and the
Republic of Nicaragua incorporated the uti possidetis juris principle into
their respective constitutions and into their treaties. Thus, for example,
Article II, paragraph 3, of the Gámez-Bonilla Treaty of 7 October 1894 —
the basis of the delimitation carried out in 1900-1904 by the Mixed Com-
mission established by Article I of that Treaty and, later, of that estab-
lished by the Arbitral Award made by the King of Spain on 23 Decem-
ber 1906 — pithily expresses the very core of the uti possidetis juris
principle as follows :
      “It is to be understood that each Republic is owner of the territory
    which at the date of independence constituted, respectively, the
    provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua.” (Arbitral Award Made by
    the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v. Nicaragua),
    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, p. 199.)

                                    *
  14. During the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth
century, uti possidetis juris was viewed by European legal scholars as a
regional doctrine or principle specific to relations between the Latin
American republics alone, with, in Europe, considerable resistance to


                  DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                   786

universal application of the principle as a positive norm of general interna-
tional law. Certain scholarly criticisms made at the time of the Award of
30 June 1865 by Isabella II, the Queen of Spain, in the Aves Island case
between the Netherlands and Venezuela reflect very accurately such sen-
timent (see P. Lapradelle et Politis, Recueil des arbitrages internationaux,
Vol. 2, pp. 404-421).
   15. At the same time, a number of arbitral awards rejected arguments
which, in the final analysis, were based on the uti possidetis juris princi-
ple, in favour of alleged effectivités as far-fetched as they were limited,
such as declaring sovereignty over an island from aboard a merchant ship
cruising some half a mile off the island in question, without leaving any
sign of sovereignty on the island (see the Arbitral Award of 28 Janu-
ary 1931 concerning the dispute between France and Mexico regarding
sovereignty over Clipperton Island, Revue générale de droit international
public, 1932, Vol. 39, pp. 129-132). Even much more recently, in the Bea-
gle Channel case between Argentina and Chile (1977), an arbitral tribunal
composed of Members of the International Court of Justice characterized
uti possidetis juris as a “doctrine” and not a “principle” (United Nations,
RIAA, Vol. XXI, p. 81, para. 9).

   16. However, once the intangibility of boundaries inherited upon
decolonization had gained general acceptance among African States, rec-
ognition of the principle of uti possidetis juris became so widespread that
in 1986 a Chamber of the International Court of Justice was able to
state :
    “Uti possidetis . . . is therefore a principle of a general kind which is
    logically connected with this form of decolonization wherever it
    occurs.” (Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali), Judg-
    ment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 566, para. 23.)
In 1992, another Chamber of the Court was prompted to apply the uti
possidetis juris principle in the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dis-
pute (El Salvador/Honduras : Nicaragua intervening)), at the same time
clarifying a number of questions of interest, in particular regarding the
territorial, island and maritime scope of the principle and the inherent
consequences of its application by international courts and tribunals
(Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 351). In 1994, in the Territorial Dis-
pute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad) case, the two Parties were in agree-
ment that, by virtue of the uti possidetis juris principle, Chad and Libya
inherited the frontiers resulting from colonization by France and Italy
respectively.
   17. More recently, in 2005, the principle was applied by another
Chamber of the Court in the case concerning the Frontier Dispute (Benin/
Niger) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 90). Elsewhere, in the case
concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between
Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain) (Merits, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 2001, p. 40), Bahrain also raised the uti possidetis juris principle


                  DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                   787

in respect of the island part of the dispute, but there was no need for the
Court to apply it because the case did not involve State succession. Fur-
thermore, over recent decades, the practical usefulness of the principle
has given rise to legal writings in favour of extending its application to
cases of State succession other than those resulting from decolonization
(for example, situations arising from the dissolution of a federal State).
   18. However, that kind of problem does not arise in the present case,
which concerns a precise instance of decolonization : the succession of
States which took place on 15 September 1821, when the former Spanish
provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua became independent sovereign
States.

                                     *
   19. The Judgment confirms that uti possidetis juris is no longer one of
those regional norms whose substance and existence must be demon-
strated by the party relying on it. While the Court thus recognizes (juris
novit curiae) uti possidetis juris as a principle of general international
law, the present Judgment also confirms the difficulties still encountered
in applying that principle to a particular area when the internal law
referred to by the Latin genitive juris is an historical jus such as that
which the Spanish Crown applied in America over more than three cen-
turies.
   20. The Judgment also confirms that the uti possidetis juris principle
refers to a notion of possession understood as possession of a right or
legal title established within the legal order of the predecessor State,
regardless of whether the territory in question was occupied or not. Fur-
thermore, according to the Judgment, the uti possidetis juris principle is
just as relevant to seeking title to a territory as it is to determining the
position of boundaries, which is in accordance with practice. In other
words, it covers disputes over delimitation in the strict sense as well as
those as to the holder of title to a particular land, island or maritime area
(disputes over attribution).

  21. The uti possidetis juris principle is thus perfectly applicable to
determining sovereignty over the disputed islands in the present case, as
expressed in the Judgment as follows :
       “If the islands are not terra nullius, as both Parties acknowledge
    and as is generally recognized, it must be assumed that they had
    been under the rule of the Spanish Crown. However, it does not nec-
    essarily follow that the successor to the disputed islands could only
    be Honduras, being the only State formally to have claimed such
    status.” (Judgment, para. 158.)


                                     *

                   DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                     788

   22. It is from this point — i.e., the issue of whether Spain had attrib-
uted the disputed islands to the province of Honduras or to that of Nica-
ragua — that my views part company with those of the majority. Our
differences thus concern the production of evidence of such attribution
and, in particular, how such evidence can be better appreciated in the
light of the nature of the original title of the Spanish Crown in its Ameri-
can territories and the characteristics and goals of its American legisla-
tion.
   23. In this respect, it is appropriate to bear in mind what was said by
a Chamber of the Court in 1992 :
     “it has to be remembered that no question of international bounda-
     ries could ever have occurred to the minds of those servants of the
     Spanish Crown who established administrative boundaries ; uti pos-
     sidetis juris is essentially a retrospective principle, investing as inter-
     national boundaries administrative limits intended originally for
     quite other purposes” (Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute
     (El Salvador/Honduras ; Nicaragua intervening), Judgment, I.C.J.
     Reports 1992, p. 388, para. 43).
   24. Where the uti possidetis juris position must be proved retroac-
tively, it is not always possible to obtain legislative or like documents
specifying the ownership or extent of the territories in question or show-
ing the exact location of provincial boundaries. It then becomes neces-
sary, in attempting to reconstruct the position, to take into consideration
all the evidence and additional information made available through his-
torical and logical interpretation. I would add that evidence in respect of
the territorial facet of uti possidetis juris is often very useful in clarifying
the delimitation aspect and vice versa.
   25. However, in the present case, identifying and proving title to the
disputed islands pursuant to uti possidetis juris is greatly facilitated by
the fact, in particular, that the King of Spain defined as follows the ter-
ritories of the provinces of Nicaragua and Honduras on the eve of inde-
pendence in the reasoning supporting his Arbitral Award of 23 Decem-
ber 1906, made on the basis of the principle of uti possidetis juris as set
out in the Gámez-Bonilla Treaty of 1894 :

  Province of Nicaragua
        “[O]n the organization of the Government and Administration of
     Nicaragua in accordance with the Royal Administrative Statutes of
     1786 it consisted of the five districts of Leon, Matagalpa, El Realejo,
     Subtiaga, and Nicoya, not comprising in this division nor in that
     proposed in 1788 by the Governor and Intendant Don Juan de Ayssa
     territories to the north and west of Cape Gracias a Dios, which are
     at the present day claimed by the Republic of Nicaragua, there being
     no record either that the jurisdiction of the diocese of Nicaragua
     reached to that Cape, and whereas it is worthy of note that the last


               DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                789

  Governor and Intendant of Nicaragua, Don Miguel González Sara-
  via, in describing the province which had been under his rule in his
  book Bosquejo Político Estadístico de Nicaragua, published in
  1824 stated that the divisionary line of said Province on the north
  runs from the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific to the River Perlas on
  the Northern Sea (Atlantic).
     [T]he Commission of investigation has not found that the expand-
  ing influence of Nicaragua has extended to the north of Cape Gra-
  cias a Dios, and therefore not reached Cape Camarón ; and that in
  no map, geographical description or other document of those exam-
  ined by said Commission is there any mention that Nicaragua had
  extended to said Cape Camarón, and there is no reason therefore to
  select said Cape as a frontier boundary with Honduras on the Atlan-
  tic Coast, as is claimed by Nicaragua.” (Recueil international des
  traités du XXe siècle, Descamps et Renault, 1906, pp. 1033-1034 ;
  English translation of the Award Made by the King of Spain, as
  appeared in British and Foreign State Papers, Vol. 100, 1906-1907,
  quoted in I.C.J. Pleadings, Arbitral Award Made by the King of
  Spain on 23 December 1906, Vol. I, p. 22.)
Province of Honduras
     “[T]he demarcation fixed for the Province or District of Comaya-
  gua or Honduras, by virtue of the Royal Decree of the 24 July 1791
  continued to be the same at the time when the Provinces of Hondu-
  ras and Nicaragua achieved independence, because though by Royal
  Decree of the 24 January 1818 the King sanctioned the re-establish-
  ment of the chief municipality of Tegucigalpa with a certain degree
  of autonomy as to its administration, said chief municipality contin-
  ued to form a district of the Province of Comayagua or Honduras,
  subject to the political chief of the province ; and in that capacity
  took part in the election, 5 November 1820, of a Deputy to the
  Spanish Cortes and a substitute Deputy for the Province of Comaya-
  gua, and likewise took part together with the other districts of Gra-
  cias, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro with Olanchito and Trujillo, Tencoa
  and Comayagua, in the election of the Provincial Council of Hon-
  duras, said election having taken place on the 6 November of the
  same year, 1820.” (Ibid., pp. 21-22.)
     “[T]hough at some time it may have been believed that the juris-
  diction of Honduras reached to the south of Cape Gracias a Dios,
  the Commission of investigation finds that said expansion of terri-
  tory was never clearly defined, and in any case was only ephemeral
  below the township and port of Cape Gracias a Dios, whilst on the
  other hand the influence of Nicaragua has been extended and exer-
  cised in a real and permanent manner towards the afore-mentioned
  Cape Gracias a Dios, and therefore it is not equitable that the com-
  mon boundary on the Atlantic Coast should be Sandy Bay as
  claimed by Honduras.” (Ibid., p. 22.)


                  DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                  790

  26. The validity and binding nature for the Parties of the Arbitral
Award made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 were confirmed
by the Judgment of the International Court of Justice of 18 Novem-
ber 1960. In the present case, Honduras relied upon both those decisions
as evidence to support its argument that it possesses sovereign title to the
disputed islands pursuant to uti possidetis juris, which can be readily un-
derstood by recalling what the Court said in its reasoning in the 1960
Judgment :

       “Nicaragua contends that the arbitrator fixed what he regarded as
    a natural boundary line without taking into account the Laws and
    Royal Warrants of the Spanish State which established the Spanish
    administrative divisions before the date of Independence. In the
    judgment of the Court this complaint is without foundation inas-
    much as the decision of the arbitrator is based on the historical and
    legal considerations (derecho histórico) in accordance with para-
    graphs 3 and 4 of Article II [of the Gámez-Bonilla Treaty].” (Arbi-
    tral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Hon-
    duras v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, p. 215 ; empha-
    sis added.)

   27. Further, the substance of the evidence and information supporting
those two decisions is both considerable in quantity and unassailable in
quality and authoritativeness, making it an essential element, in my view,
in a judicial determination of the uti possidetis juris situation of the
islands disputed by the Parties. I must therefore give it due consideration
in this opinion. Such a choice is a necessary one, moreover, as indicated
by the jurisprudence in the case concerning the Land, Island and Mari-
time Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras ; Nicaragua intervening) :


    “in the previous Latin American boundary arbitrations it is the
    award that is now determinative, even though it be based upon a
    view of the uti possidetis juris position. The award’s view of the uti
    possidetis juris position prevails and cannot now be questioned
    juridically, even if it could be questioned historically”. (Judgment,
    I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 401, para. 67.)



   28. Honduras also relies on the Royal Warrants of 23 August 1745
and 30 November 1803, as well as the documentation relating to the 1906
Arbitration published in I.C.J. Pleadings, Arbitral Award Made by the
King of Spain on 23 December 1906, for example the information con-
tained in the “Report of the Commission of Investigation of the Question
of the Boundary between the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua sub-
mitted to His Majesty Alfonso XIII, Arbitrator, on 22 July 1906”, which


                  DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                    791

was appended to Honduras’s Reply in the case judged by the Court in
1960 (Vol. I, Ann. XI, p. 621).

                                      *
   29. Thus, to determine whether sovereignty over the disputed islands
belongs to Honduras or Nicaragua, the Court must begin with the assess-
ment of the uti possidetis juris position of 1821 made by the 1906 Arbitral
Award. The islands concerned are not mentioned in the operative part of
the Award, but the delimitation of the land boundary between the Parties
established by the Award makes it possible to identify precisely which, in
the relevant area, are the coasts belonging to Honduras and which to
Nicaragua. The Award states that :
       “The extreme common boundary point on the coast of the Atlan-
    tic will be the mouth of the River Coco, Segovia or Wanks, where it
    flows out in the sea close to Cape Gracias a Dios, taking as the
    mouth of the river that of its principal arm between Hara and the
    Island of San Pío where said Cape is situated, leaving to Honduras
    the islets and shoals existing within said principal arm before reach-
    ing the harbour bar, and retaining for Nicaragua the southern shore
    of the said principal mouth with the said Island of San Pío, and also
    the bay and the town of Cape Gracias a Dios and the arm or estuary
    called Gracias which flows to Gracias a Dios Bay, between the main-
    land and the said Island of San Pío.” (Arbitral Award Made by the
    King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v. Nicaragua),
    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, p. 202.)
Further, the Court’s Judgment of 1960 stipulated that :
       “The operative clause of the Award, as already indicated, directs
    that ‘starting from the mouth of the Segovia or Coco the frontier
    line will follow the vaguada or thalweg of this river upstream’. It is
    obvious that in this context the thalweg was contemplated in the
    Award as constituting the boundary between the two States even at
    the ‘mouth of the river’. In the opinion of the Court, the determina-
    tion of the boundary in this section should give rise to no difficulty.”
    (Ibid., p. 216.)
   30. It is therefore clear that, according to the uti possidetis juris posi-
tion as established by the Arbitral Award with the force of res judicata,
the coast of Honduras stretches northwards from the extreme common
point of the land boundary on the Atlantic coast, situated in the mouth
of the principal arm of the River Coco where it flows out in the sea close
to Cape Gracias a Dios, up to the boundary with Guatemala, and the
coast of Nicaragua extends to the south of the same extreme common
boundary point up to the boundary with Costa Rica.
   31. The establishment of the endpoint of the land boundary in the
mouth of the principal arm of the River Coco where it flows into the sea


                 DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                 792

close to Cape Gracias a Dios determines precisely what were the Parties’
coastlines in 1821 and, accordingly, the reference point allowing for un-
problematic application of the notion of “adjacent island” under histori-
cal Spanish law. Such a clear situation did not exist for the islands in
dispute between El Salvador and Honduras in the waters of the historic
Bay of Fonseca referred to in the Judgment. The relationship between the
coasts of the three riparian States in the Bay of Fonseca was not as
apparent and clear-cut as that existing between the coast of Honduras
and Nicaragua in the present case.
   32. However, what is of interest in the relevant quotation given by the
Judgment is the confirmation that
    “when the principle of the uti possidetis juris is involved, the jus
    referred to is not international law but the constitutional or admin-
    istrative law of the pre-independence sovereign” (Land, Island and
    Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras ; Nicaragua inter-
    vening), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 559, para. 333).
And the jus applied by the Spanish Crown in its American territories
made use of a notion of “adjacent islands”, as a general criterion for
attributing islands to one or other colonial district or province, whose
scope is different from that of the notion of “adjacent island” in contem-
porary international law.

                                    *
   33. Under historical Spanish law as applied by the Spanish Crown to
its American territories, the notion of “adjacent island” was considerably
broader and more flexible than that of “coastal island” in contemporary
international law. The 1865 Arbitral Award in the Aves Island (Nether-
lands/Venezuela) case demonstrates that the notion of “adjacent island”
in Spanish colonial law also covered small islands a long way from the
coast, whether or not they were suitable for human habitation or pos-
sessed an economic activity or strategic importance. Aves Island (Bird
Island) was a small, low-lying rock, located in the middle of the Carib-
bean Sea, incapable of sustaining permanent habitation and which had
never really been occupied. When it was discovered by the Spanish, it was
initially included in the territories of the former Audiencia of Santo
Domingo and then transferred to the Audiencia of Caracas (Royal Order
of 13 June 1786), despite its distance from the coast of the Captaincy-
General of Venezuela (see P. Lapradelle et Politis, Recueil des arbitrages
internationaux, Vol. 2, pp. 404-406). Clipperton Island, which was also
discovered by the Spanish, lies a very long way from the Mexican coast ;
nevertheless, it was claimed by Mexico as the successor to Spain (Revue
générale de droit international public, 1932, Vol. 39, p. 130).

   34. The San Andrés Islands are also situated a considerable distance

agree with the finding in paragraph 163 of the present Judgment.

   35. It goes without saying that the general criterion for the attribution
of the islands mentioned above was merely a kind of residual rule in that
it could be set aside at any time by a specific normative provision to the
contrary enacted by the King. By way of example, there was the Royal
Warrant of 1803 on the islands of San Andrés or the Royal Order of
13 June 1786 on Aves Island. But Nicaragua has offered no evidence of
any specific decision by the King departing from that general criterion in
favour of the province of Nicaragua in respect of the islands involved in
the present case. What Nicaragua has argued in this case is that it was
impossible to settle the issue of sovereignty over the cays on the basis of
the uti possidetis juris of 1821.
   36. The Spanish Crown used a particularly broad and flexible notion
of “adjacent island”, an expression which occurs very often in its over-
seas legislative texts, both for practical reasons and as a matter of prin-
ciple. In the first place, it sought to protect the integrity of its original
title to vast areas — defined by parallels and meridians — which had
been set aside for it by Papal Bulls and treaties with Portugal, i.e., “all
lands discovered and yet to be discovered” within those areas. Secondly,
exploration of the huge expanse of the Americas could only be carried
out by stages, and the undertaking lasted for centuries. Finally, the risk
had to be avoided of other Powers taking control of territories that were
unexplored, unknown, sparsely populated or difficult to defend. And in
that respect, the “islands” were certainly the most exposed territories,
especially those a long way from the coasts or from Spanish jurisdictional
waters.
   37. In any event, the role and rule-making importance of the broad
and flexible concept of “adjacent island” in Spanish colonial law cannot
be doubted. The treaties concluded by Spain in the nineteenth century
with the new Republics, including the Republic of Nicaragua (1856) and
the Republic of Honduras (1860), attest to that : indeed, they confirm the
relinquishment by Spain of its previous title not only to the mainland ter-
ritories of the province of Nicaragua and the province of Honduras, but
also to the island territory of both provinces as it existed in 1821. Fur-


                   DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                    794

thermore, the Constitutions of the Republic of Honduras and the Repub-
lic of Nicaragua also include the expression “adjacent islands” in their
respective definitions of national territory.

   38. The 1906 Arbitral Award made by the King of Spain delimited a
section of the land boundary between the two Parties, but the decision
also, barring evidence to the contrary, inevitably determined sovereignty
over the island possessions and the Spanish jurisdictional waters adjacent
to the mainland. Why ? Because in delimiting the land boundary, the
Award defined the mainland coast of Honduras in the area concerned as
being situated north of the mouth of the River Coco, close to Cape Gra-
cias a Dios, i.e., north of approximately the 15th parallel, and that of
Nicaragua as being located south of the said river mouth and the 15th
parallel.
   39. Consequently, the Arbitral Award of 1906 makes it possible to
give a legal answer, on the basis of the uti possidetis juris of 1821, to the
question of sovereignty over the islands in dispute between the Parties,
since the four cays concerned lie offshore north of the 15th parallel and
in the vicinity of Honduras’s mainland coast, and closer to that coast
than to the Nicaraguan mainland coast south of the 15th parallel. In such
a situation, if the general criterion for the attribution of “adjacent islands”
in historical Spanish law is taken into consideration, as it should be, there
can be no possible doubt that the cays belong to Honduras. The conduct
of the Parties during the arbitration proceedings bears out such a conclu-
sion. It therefore follows that I cannot accept the finding to the contrary
by the majority of the Court set out in paragraph 167 of the Judgment.

                                      *
   40. In the arbitration by the King of Spain, Nicaragua sought to obtain
from the Arbitrator a boundary line running along the 85th meridian west,
making it into a sort of land, island and maritime boundary with Hondu-
ras. Indeed, in its submissions concerning the last part of the boundary
line, Nicaragua asked the Arbitrator for the frontier line to continue
     “along the middle of the river until it meets the meridian which
     passes through Cape Camarón and from that meridian until it loses
     itself in the sea, leaving to Nicaragua Swan Island” (I.C.J. Plead-
     ings, Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 Decem-
     ber 1906, Vol. I, p. 624).
The origin of that submission can be traced back to a proposal made by
Nicaragua to the Mixed Commission established pursuant to the Gámez-
Bonilla Treaty (for the reasoning advanced by Nicaragua at the time and
Honduras’s reply within the Mixed Commission, see ibid., pp. 246 and
248 ; see also in the present case CMH, Vol. 1, Plate 9).
   41. If the Arbitrator had accepted Nicaragua’s submission, the disputed
islands in the present case would have been “adjacent islands” to the main-


                  DISPUTE (DISS. OP. TORRES BERNÁRDEZ)                    795

land coast of the province of Nicaragua and, consequently, islands of the
Republic of Nicaragua from 1821 by virtue of the uti possidetis juris. How-
ever, the King of Spain rejected Nicaragua’s submission. The Arbitrator’s
decision was, as we have just said, to fix the extreme common boundary
point of the two Republics in the mouth of the principal arm of the
River Coco, where it flows into the sea, close to Cape Gracias a Dios —
that is to say practically on the 15th parallel North, and not to the north or
the south of that parallel — because, as observed in the Arbitral Award of
1906, the “documents” described Cape Gracias a Dios as the boundary
point of the “jurisdictions” which the Royal Decrees of 1745 assigned to
the Governors of the provinces of Honduras (Juan de Vera) and Nicara-
gua (Alonso Fernández de Heredia) (Recueil international des traités du
XXe siècle, Descamps et Renault, 1906, p. 1031).
   42. It is surprising that the majority does not draw any conclusions in
terms of the production of evidence from the combined effect of (a) the
1906 Arbitral Award’s adoption as a limit, on the basis of the uti possi-
detis juris, of the parallel at Cape Gracias a Dios, and (b) its rejection of
the Cape Camarón meridian advanced by Nicaragua. On the contrary,
according to the Judgment, the provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua
appear to have had, in reality, neither coastlines, nor territorial seas, nor
their own adjacent islands, which are said to have been under the control
of the joint higher colonial administrative unit, namely the Captaincy-
General of Guatemala. This argument — often repeated in legal and
arbitral proceedings relating to Central America, for want of anything
better — may also be answered by the reasoning of the Arbitral Award
made by the King of Spain in 1906, where it is observed that :
    “when by virtue of the Treaty with Great Britain in 1786 the British
    evacuated the country of the Mosquitos, at the same time that new
    Regulations were made for the port of Trujillo, it was likewise ordained
    to raise four new Spanish settlements on the Mosquito Coast in
    Rio Tinto, Cape Gracias á Dios, Blewfields and the mouth of the
    River San Juan, although it is nevertheless true that these settlements
    remained directly subject to the Captain-General’s command of Guate-
    mala, both parties agreed to recognize that this fact in no way altered
    the territories of the provinces of Nicaragua and Honduras, the latter
    Republic having shown by means of certified copies of despatches and
    accounts both before and after 1791 the Intendant Governorship of
    Comayagua superintended everything appertaining to its competence in
    Trujillo, Rio Tinto and Cape Gracias á Dios” (Recueil international des
    traités du XXe siècle, Descamps et Renault, 1906, p. 1031 ; English
    translation of the Award Made by the King of Spain, as appeared in
    British and Foreign State Papers, Vol. 100, 1906-1907, quoted in the
    Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Hon-
    duras v. Nicaragua), Application Instituting Proceedings, Ann. II).

   43. It thus transpires from the King of Spain’s Arbitral Award that,
north of the 15th parallel, the coastline and, consequently, the islands
adjacent to it belong to Honduras, according to the principle of the uti
possidetis juris of 1821 ; and that south of that parallel, the coastline and,
consequently, the islands adjacent to it belong to Nicaragua, since neither
of the Parties has produced before the Court a royal decision to the con-
trary.
   44. Therefore, in application of the uti possidetis juris principle, sov-
ereignty over the island features south of the 15th parallel North, such as
