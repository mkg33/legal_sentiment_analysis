                        7. I see the extent of the power of the Contracting Government to
                     grant a special permit and the extent of the power of the Court to review
                     the grant as being essentially interrelated. The wider the power of the
                     Contracting Government the more limited the power of the Court to
                     review. For me, three features of the power conferred on Contracting
                     Governments by Article VIII (I) of the Convention are significant. The
                     first is that the wording of the provision at its core is not subjective. It
                     does not say that a Contracting Government may grant a special permit
                     for “what it considers to be” scientific research. The non‑appearance of
                     those words is emphasized by the subjective wording appearing at the end
                     of that sentence — “as the Contracting Government thinks fit”. Such
                     wording was, for instance, in issue in the Certain Questions of Mutual
                     Assistance in Criminal Matters case, where the Court nevertheless consid-
                     ered that it had some power of review ((Djibouti v. France), Judgment,
                     I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 229, para. 145). That case is helpful in a second
                     and more important way since the assessment there by the relevant State
                     authority was based on that State’s own assessment of prejudice to its
                     “essential interests”. The assessment here, by contrast, relates to a much
                     more concrete matter — a programme for the purposes of scientific
                     research relating to whales and associated matters. A third feature is the
                     common interest of all the Contracting Governments in the operation of
                     the Convention with the related roles of the IWC and its Scientific Com-
                     mittee. Those features all indicate for me real limits on the power of the
                     Contracting Government to grant a special permit. A fourth significant
                     matter bearing directly on the Court’s exercise of its power of review in
                     this case is the extensive body of information in the record before it about
                     the process which led to the range of decisions to establish the
                     JARPA II programme and about its implementation.

                     the Court, I formulate it in this way : Is the Contracting Government’s
                     decision to award a special permit objectively justifiable in the sense that
                     the decision is supported by coherent scientific reasoning ? The test does
                     not require that the programme be “justified”, rather, that on the record
                     it is justifiable. Nor is it for the Court to decide on the scientific merit of
                     the programme’s objectives nor whether its design and implementation
                     are the best possible means of achieving those objectives. But it does have
                     the role of assessing, in the light of the features of the power mentioned
                     in the previous paragraph, the evidence to see whether it demonstrates
                     coherent scientific reasoning supporting central features of the pro-
                     gramme. Such tests, like that stated by the Court, become clearer as they
                     are applied to the facts in issue.

                        9. Subject to one matter of emphasis, I have nothing to add to the
                     reasons given in support of the conclusions reached by the Court relating
                     to the decisions taken by the Japanese authorities regarding the use of
                     lethal methods as opposed to non-lethal ones (paras. 128‑144) and the
                     determination of the sample sizes (paras. 147‑198) ; and relating to the
                     comparison of the sample size to the actual take (paras. 199‑212). The
                     matter of emphasis is that for me the evidence demonstrates a failure by
                     the Japanese authorities even to address central matters involved in the
                     initial design and ongoing implementation of the programme.

                        10. In respect of the decisions regarding the use of lethal methods and
                     non‑lethal ones, I see as critical the failure of Japan to provide any evi-
                     dence of any studies which it undertook of the use of non‑lethal methods
                     through the long period running from the planning of the programme to
                     the present day (see in particular paragraphs 136‑141). The Court did, by
                     contrast, receive evidence from the two experts called by Australia about
                     the enhancement and wider use over that time of non‑lethal methods
                     which were capable of being used for at least some of the objectives of the
                     programme.
                        11. So far as the determination of the sample sizes is concerned, the
                     lack of any clear explanation in the record for the choices of a 12‑year
                     research period for two of the species and of six years for the other means,
                     as I see the matter, that those aspects of the decision which are critical for
                     the sizes of the samples of the different species are not supported by
                     coherent scientific reasoning. Among the objectives of the programme are
                     inter-species competition and ecosystem research (paras. 176‑178). A sim-
                     ilar lack of explanation appears in respect of the choice of annual sample
                     sizes of 50 for each of the humpback and fin species when the Research

                     Plan for the programme called for a take of at least 131 of each species
                     for the purpose of one of the objectives (para. 179).

                        12. I next see as significant the essential failure of Japan to explain in a
                     persuasive manner the big increase in the target for minke whales from
                     JARPA to JARPA II. On the one hand, it said that the new objectives
                     were a major reason, when they do not appear to be clearly distinct from
                     the objectives of JARPA as they existed in the last part of that pro-
                     gramme ; but, on the other, it emphasized the need for continuity in mov-
                     ing from the first to the second programme (paras. 147‑156). It does not
                     appear to me to be scientifically credible to maintain both of those argu-
                     ments at one and the same time.
                        13. Finally, I consider the difference between the sample size and the
                     actual take. I see it as significant that, while Japan has continued to issue
                     special permits for the taking of the same numbers of the three species
                     throughout the programme, except for 2005 and 2006 in respect of fin
                     and humpback whales, it has never reported to the IWC and in particular
                     to the Scientific Committee on the consequences of the much reduced
                     takes of minke whales and fin whales and the nil take of humpback
                     whales for the design and implementation of the programme
                     (paras. 209‑212). The Annexes to Japan’s Counter‑Memorial in the part
                     concerned with documents which it issued (Anns. 133‑159) include only
                     three possibly relevant documents submitted to the IWC or its Scien-
                     tific Committee (Anns. 152, 153 and 156) and none on its face addresses
                     those changes and the possible consequences for the research. Only one of
                     them dates from the time of the full‑scale operation of JARPA II and
                     does no more than list publications arising from JARPA II as well as
                     from JARPA. That failure is to be seen in the context of the requirements
                     of paragraph 30 of the Schedule and the duty of co‑operation with the
                     IWC and its Scientific Committee which, as the Court notes, both Parties
                     and the intervening State recognize (paras. 83 and 240).

                        14. To summarize, the evidence before the Court, as I read it, does not
                     show that the Japanese authorities in planning and implementing the pro-
                     gramme have given any real consideration or indeed any consideration at
                     all to the central elements of the programme discussed above. Accord-
                     ingly, and for the reasons also given by the Court, I conclude that the
                     programme does not fall within the scope of Article VIII (1) and that, as
                     a consequence, the actions of Japan, taken in terms of the programme,
                     for the killing, taking and treating of whales under it, breach para-
                     graph 10 (e), paragraph 10 (d) and paragraph 7 (b) of the Schedule.
