1. At the beginning of his separate opinion in the Corfu Channel case,
Judge A. Alvarez, alluding to the fundamental changes which have taken
place in every sphere of human activity in recent decades, and especially
in international affairs and international law, wrote:

“It is therefore necessary to consider what is the present state of
that law. We must examine it in connection with the questions
raised by the dispute submitted to the Court. That does not mean
that this Court should pronounce on all the legal issues which those
questions connote; but it seems desirable that one of the judges, at
least, should examine them, and that is the task I have set myself in
this individual opinion.” (I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 39.)

I subscribe to this statement, the more so since the legal questions
raised by the case which has been submitted to the Court cannot but feel
the effects of the great renovating movement in international law which is
evident in the relations between nations and in the activities of inter-
national institutions. The development which the modern world is
witnessing affects the very structures of international law—including the
concept of sovereignty—and even its main sources, namely treaties,
custom and the general principles of law recognized by the nations. More
than one concept, principle or legal norm of the older classical law has
been called into question anew since international co-operation has
become common practice, since law has become imbued with morality,
and—a point of particular importance—since a considerable number of
States have acquired independence and sovereignty, or have siezed them
by main force, and have entered into the world community of nations.
Linked to this development, which it will be necessary to touch upon, to
this dynamism of the law which, it has been said, is a continual creation,
is the idea which must be formed of the international responsibility of
States, and its corollary, diplomatic protection, upon which the Court is
called upon to pronounce.

2. In order to make an exhaustive study of Belgium’s jus standi in
judicio which had been the subject of a preliminary objection, it was
recognized by the Judgment of 24 July 1964 as indispensable to refer to
certain points of fact and of law relating to the merits of the case, al-
though jus standi does not thereby lose its character as an objection.

Belgium has however questioned whether, in view of the subject of the



dispute between the Parties, which it contends deals only with the con-
ditions and limits of the international responsibility of a State towards
the foreign shareholders in a commercial holding company, it is possible
to speak of a preliminary objection on this point. In other words, what is
being debated as a preliminary issue is, it is said, international responsi-
bility, rather than diplomatic protection.

In order to reply to this question, it is sufficient to add to the arguments
appearing in the aforementioned Judgment that the right of diplomatic
protection, so far as it materializes in a legal action, is to be distinguished
from the substantive right which the applicant State claims to have re-
established. The question thus involves the distinction between the subject-
matter of the action and the subject-matter of the right claimed, a dis-
tinction about which legal writers are generally in agreement !. An objec-
tion, considered in opposition to the setting in motion of a legal action,
should not be confused with a defence concerning the right at issue. There
would in fact be an internal contradiction in the fact of confusing two
different things in the concept of a claim, namely its admissibility and its
validity. Proof that an applicant has the status required to exercise legal
power, or that he has a right entitling him to bring the matter before a
court, may, as in the present case, involve raising questions which are not
unrelated to the merits, but it cannot have any influence on the nature of
the action, or the nature of the objection to the exercise thereof.

At all events, the joinder of the objection to the merits justifies, so far
as this may be necessary, extending the present study beyond diplomatic
protection to include international responsibility.

3. That much having been said, the solution to the problem of jus
standi, which calls in question the principle of international responsi-
bility and the rules of diplomatic and judicial protection designed to give
effect to that principle, is clearly linked to the overall problem of the
development of modern international law in the face of recent trans-
formations in international life. This is a burning question of today, the
more complex in that it is conditioned by the essential needs of various
peoples, ever since nations have emerged from dependence with inter-
ests which are manifold and often difficult to reconcile among themselves
or with those of the other nations of the world. This problem must there-
fore not be lost sight of throughout the present opinion.

x * +
The radical transformations which have occurred in economic affairs
in the last half-century, the constantly increasing expansion which has
marked the recent decades in a world undergoing rapid social and political
development, and the new problems to which these changes have given
rise, call for a corresponding development of juridical structures. The

law, a rigid conservative kind of law, cannot adapt the emerging reality
to sacrosanct rules rooted in the remote past. It must, on the contrary,
adapt itself to the imperious needs of an international society which is
moving towards universalism; it must adapt itself thereto in order to
avoid confrontation between peoples, and lest it lose its footing in the
upward march of progress towards better justice and the common aspira-
tion towards the ideals of prosperity and peace.

It is well known that the established lead taken by facts and events over
the law has had to be corrected more than once in the past 2. In the sphere
of international law, the adaptation of law to factual situations, rendered
necessary by the political change which had world-wide repercussions
in the middle of this century, was largely accomplished by the solemn
enunciation of the principles and purposes of the United Nations. The
implementation of these has however been more effective within the
political organs of the world Organization than it has been in the domain
of international tribunals where problems have arisen on the legal level
as a result of the breach between law and social reality. Thus it is in the
interests of justice and of law that these problems should be approached
with a clear vision of the meaning of history and an overall picture of a
world from which no-one should henceforth be excluded, no matter how
late he has come on the scene.

This situation could however not escape the foresight of the Inter-
national Court of Justice. Thus the Advisory Opinion which it delivered
in 1949, in connection with the reparation for injuries suffered in the
service of the United Nations, must be given its full significance; it stated
that: “Throughout its history, the development of international law has
been influenced by the requirements of international life 3.”

This observation is more topical than ever. International life is being
influenced by those States which have now rounded out the circle of the
community of nations, increasing the number thereof almost threefold.
International law cannot leave out of account the aspirations of the world
in which henceforth it has its existence, and it is significant that these
States are manifesting a certain amount of impatience tinged with ap-
prehension.

We shall see later what their attitude has been with regard to the rules
concerning the responsibility of States and diplomatic protection.

supplemented the formalistic quiritary law, which had lagged behind the development
of the quasi-international structures of the Emipire; by the blossoming of Moslem
law, freed from all outgrown formalism and all illusory symbolism, which set its
seal on the basic transformation of legal concepts in most of the countries under its
sway; and nearer to our own day, in the United Kingdom and those countries
which adopted its law, with the institution of equity which plays an important part
in making up for the insufficiencies of the common law; lastly, by the complete
renewal of law in the Socialist countries in order to keep pace with the advent of a
new ideology and a new way of life which have broken radically with the past.

4. The problems confronting the world, now that a large-scale political
emancipation of the dependent peoples has been carried out, are those
relating to the establishment of economic and social justice and to develop-
ment. According to one of the great African leaders, President L. S.
Senghor, “legal independence without economic independence is but a
new form of dependency, worse than the first because it is less obvious” *.
The Director-General of FAO recently warned the world about the
dangers of a world-wide famine in the next 24 to 28 years, unless pro-
duction is increased in the developing countries. And more recently
the Symposium of African archbishops and bishops, which was brought
to a close on 1 August 1969 by the Sovereign Pontiff, roundly denounced
the increase in the riches of some through the exploitation of the poverty
of others °.

This problem arises particularly in connection with the great economic,
commercial and financial undertakings which have multiplied and grown
beyond the confines of their respective countries in such a way as to
necessitate a parallel development of international law. International law
should certainly avoid trying to fit their action into outworn forms; it
should work to bring about a just protection of their interests in the bitter
but beneficient struggle of international competition ©.

On the other hand, the law should be no less concerned with the in-
terests of the countries to which those powerful undertakings and the
companies controlling them—trusts or holding companies of pyramidal
structure—extend their activities, thereby certainly rendering appreciable

Reference may also be made to the conclusions of E. McWhinney who writes:
“It becomes clear that the development and completion of a viable system of
international ordre public in the last third of the century will depend to a
considerable extent upon the efforts made to bridge the gap in prosperity that
exists between on the one hand the countries of the Soviet bloc and the West,
and the Third World on the other” (Latin America, Africa and Asia). Revue
générale de droit international public, 1968, p. 341. [Translation by the Registry}).

6 Cf. what was said by Mr. Haroldo Valladäo, the then President of the Session of
the Institut de droit international, referring to—

‘the power of the international companies with investments in the developing
countries, [which] has given rise to a special treatment for such investments”.
(Annuaire de l’Institut de droit international, 1967, 11, p. 432 [Translation by the
Registry].)

service to the economy of the host countries, but also exposing that weaker
economy to dangers which it ought to be spared. The States of the Third
World showed insight when they agreed to insert in the 1960 Declaration
on the Grant of Independence the provision:

“affirming that peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of
their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obliga-
tions arising out of international economic co-operation, based upon
the principle of mutual benefit and international law”. (UN Doc.
A/4684, p. 66.)

One cannot help thinking, in this connection, of the large companies
which continue to undertake the exploitation of the natural resources of
the less developed countries, including their agricultural, timber and
mineral wealth, their oil production, and also their transport and other
public or municipal services. An equitable sharing of the profits is
mandatory. The anxieties of the countries whose resources are being
exploited by means of foreign technical and financial co-operation are
deeply felt, as will be seen below in connection with the application of
diplomatic protection and its possible extension, as in the present case, to
new situations, with a view to the increased protection of foreign in-
terests.

The development of international law cannot therefore have as its sole
or principal object the protection of foreign nationals and of the inter-
national economic activities of the industrialized Powers. It must set itself
an objective which is more comprehensive and more just, and a more
equitable and more humanitarian ideal, in which the material and in-
tangible interests of the weaker and deprived peoples are factors to be

taken into account.

5. In this connection, it is essential to stress the trends of Latin-
American law and that of Asia and Africa, and their undeniable in-
fluence on the development of traditional international law.

It seems indeed that among the principles and norms which have
sprung from the regional law peculiar to Latin America are the norms and
principles whose aim is to protect countries in that part of the world
against the more powerful industrialized States of North America and
Europe.

An Afro-Asian law also seems to be developing as a result of the same
preoccupations, springing from the same causes. In the field of the respon-
sibility of States and of diplomatic protection, the same points of view
have been adopted in the countries of the three continents, thus initiating
a form of co-operation which will not be of slight effect on the renewal
of law ,

6% This co-operation received an initial implementation, as regards the effect of


BARCELONA TRACTION (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 291

The first reaction to the rules of traditional law came however from
the countries of Latin America; witness the vehement speech made by
Mr. Seijas, a former Venezuelan minister, at the 1891 Session of the
Institut de droit international at Hamburg, which was no mere display of
bad temper. Evidence of this too is the appearance of the Calvo Clause,
excluding recourse to international adjudication in favour of internal
remedies, on which the jurists of Latin America have never compromised,
because of their lack of confidence in diplomatic protection as conceived
by traditional law and the practices of western nations. This reaction on
the part of the Latin American States would, moreover, explain their
opposition from 1948 onwards to the draft insurance guarantee agree-
ment proposed by the United States, providing for the exercise of diplo-
matic protection by that power without local remedies having been ex-
hausted 7.

This attitude on the part of the Hispanic States, which is shared by the
Afro-Asian States, is the more readily understandable if the extra-legal
forms and means to which diplomatic protection formerly had recourse
are borne in mind. It will be recalled that the claims of great States and
their nationals abroad often led, during the period preceding the renewal
of the law consequent upon two world wars and the creation of a means
of international adjudication, to acute conflicts and to acts of deliberate
violence going so far as armed intervention and permanent occupation 2,
or to demonstrations of force °, against which the Drago doctrine, which
was endorsed by the Pan-American Conference of 1906 and has since
become one of the basic principles of Latin American international law,
has, since 1926, reacted not without success. Recourse to force, subject to
an offer of arbitration, was nevertheless tolerated by The Hague Peace
Conference of 1907, which admitted intervention sub modo by virtue of
the Porter Convention, against which Convention Drago and his Latin
American colleagues vainly protested at the Conference. This was not the

economic facts on international law, at the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development held in Geneva in 1964, where 77 Latin American, African and
Asian States resolved to meet and negotiate through the intermediary of common
spokesmen.

7 Mexico had been forced to agree in the 1923 Convention with the United
States not to avail itself of the condition of the prior exhaustion of local remedies.

See in this connection the relevant speeches to the Institut de droit international by
Mr. Haroldo Valladäo and Mr. Kamil Yasseen and by Mr. Jiménez de Aréchaga,
who rightly points to the discrimination which the exclusion of prior recourse to
local remedies would entail (Annuaire de l’Institut de droit international, 1967, II
pp. 431, 432, 435-436).

bellion of 1900, of Tunisia from 1881 to 1956, of Egypt from 1882 to 1954 and of

of the ephemeral Mexican Empire (P. C. Jessup, A Modern Law of Nations, p. 113).

least of the contradictions which attended it, contradictions which be-
speak the still predominant influence of the colonialist era. Accordingly,
one is entitled to suspect certain arbitral decisions of having been agreed
to or accepted under duress, those decisions having been preceded by
ultimata or menaces or by a deployment of force more or less in the spirit
of the said Conference, which was struggling to free itself from a tyran-
nical tradition 1°.

If the Drago doctrine has finally triumphed, and if the Porter Conven-
tion, on the insistence of Mexico, expressing Latin American opinion at
the Chapultepec Conference in 1945, is now recognized as incompatible
with the terms of Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, it is never-
theless the case that many decisions have not avoided all confusion be-
tween reparation sticto sensu, as in private municipal law, and the
“satisfaction” demanded by powerful States, which gives reparation
lato sensu the character of a measure aimed at deterrence or punish-
ment !°. This right to punish, which is arrogated to themselves by certain
States, and to which such eminent writers as Bluntschli, Liszt and Fau-
chille, as well as a 1927 resolution of the Institut de droit international
have lent their authority, seems to have been rejected by Anzilotti, who
noted that in all forms of reaction against the unlawful act there were
present ““... an element of satisfaction and an element of reparation,
the notion of punishment of the unlawful act and that of reparation for
the wrong suffered” !!. Thus, the opposition of Latin American or Afro-
Asian jurists to the western conception of responsibility and diplomatic
protection is founded not only on memories of a painful past, but also
on serious apprehensions.

The development of Latin American thought concerning diplomatic
protection and its limits must be particularly stressed in the present dis-
cussion, on account of the influence which it can have on the develop-
ment of that institution. This thought is at present centred on the fol-
lowing aspects of the problem:

A. The 20 States of South and Central America all reject the rule laid
down by Vatel and endorsed by the Permanent Court of International
Justice, according to which the right of diplomatic protection is “to
ensure, in the person of its subjects, respect for the rules of international
law”. They hold it to be a fiction, which one of their most eminent jurists,

Asian States and one African State.

Garcia Robles, has described as “a product of Hegelian influence,
resulting from the expansionism of the nineteenth century” 2. And all
these States, at inter-American conferences, in the writings of publicists,
in the positions adopted by governments, are united in their efforts for
its elimination, on the understanding that the individual’s status as a
subject of the law is to be recognized, thus enabling him to seek legal
redress himself, and not under the cloak of his national State 1%, But
before what tribunal? Before an American regional tribunal. The resolu-
tion submitted to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires and
adopted almost unanimously reads: “American legal controversies should
be decided by American judges... and a correct understanding of acts
pertaining to the Americas is more readily to be obtained by Americans
themselves”.

Since the same causes produce the same effects, the States of the
Organization of African Unity wrote into the Addis Ababa Charter the
same objective of the creation of a regional tribunal 13.

The countries of Latin America have gone further still. In 1948 they
unanimously adopted a resolution at Bogota whereby they undertook
not to bring a claim before a court of international jurisdiction, not ex-
cluding the International Court of Justice 3,

B. The States of Latin America remain firmly attached to the Calvo
Clause, which they habitually insert in contracts entered into with
foreign undertakings. Their constitutions and laws generally make it
compulsory. Their doctrine with regard thereto, founded upon the two
principles of equality between States and non-intervention, was forcefully
expressed by Judge Guerrero, a former President of the Court, in the
report which he submitted on behalf of the Subcommittee set up by the
Committee of Experts of the League of Nations to study the respons-
ibility of States. Several non-American countries were not hostile to this
point of view. China, Holland and Finland were frankly favourable to it.

!? At the Third Session of the Inter-American Bar Association, Mr. Garcia
Robles won over to the Latin American cause Mr. F. R. Coudert, the North
American President of the Association, and all its members. ‘

122 The status of the individual as a subject of the law, which has its supporters
outside America, was to a certain extent recognized in the 1926 award by the
Mexican-American Commission in the North American Dredging Company case.

!3 E, McWhinney has pointed out that—

“there has in the past been a notable reluctance on the part of numerous States,
and, in particular, of the new States, to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice, because those States have felt that the Court
would apply the old rules, in the elaboration and development of which they
had not participated and a great number of which they regarded as unreason-
able or unjust” (op. cit, p. 331 [Translation by the Registry]).

138 <The High Contracting Parties bind themselves not to make diplomatic
representations in order to protect their nationals, or to refer a controversy to a
court of international jurisdiction for that purpose, when the said nationals have
had available the means to place their case before competent domestic courts of the
respective State.” (Art. VII of the Pact of Bogotd, 1948.)


BARCELONA TRACTION (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 294

Finally, the United States, which had found in Borchard a vigorous
defender of the thesis that the individual cannot dispose of a right which,
according to Vatelian doctrine, is that of the State and not his own,
allowed itself to be won over, with the inauguration of the “good neigh-
bour” policy of F. D. Roosevelt, to the doctrine of its southern neigh-
bours 4.

C. The Calvo clause, which on the other side of the Atlantic is re-
garded merely as a compromise, was destined to prepare the way for the
adoption of the Calvo doctrine, which is aimed at nothing less than the
abolition of unilateral diplomatic protection in order to substitute for it
a protection exercised by the collectivity on the basis of human rights.

The path towards this unconcealed objective is certainly a long and
arduous one; its success seems bound up with the progress of mankind
towards an inter-American or international organization less removed
than the United Nations from the concept of the Super-State.

*
* *

It was the more necessary to recall these features of American law in
that other States are treading the same path towards the limitation of
diplomatic protection. The States of Africa and of Asia, since they too
have come to participate in international life, share the same concerns,—
as witness the proceedings of the International Law Commission. At its
Ninth Session in 1957, Mr. Padilla Nervo stated that:

“...the history of the institution of State responsibility was the
history of the obstacles placed in the way of the new Latin American
countries—obstacles to the defence of their . . . independence, to the
ownership and development of their resources, and to their social
integration”.

And he added:

“With State responsibility . . . international rules were established,
not merely without reference to small States but against them 5,”

And Mr. El-Erian, of the United Arab Republic, stressed the twofold
consequence of the privileged condition accorded to nationals of Western
countries in their relations with the countries of Africa or Asia, which on

14 See also the important award in the North American Dredging Company case
in 1926 between the United States and Mexico, which took a clear step in this
direction and has since become an authoritative precedent. The Calvo Clause was
unanimously upheld in order to dismiss the claim, notwithstanding the provisions
of the 1923 Treaty exonerating the claimant from having to exhaust local remedies.
The scope of the clause is, however, limited to the individuals right and leaves
untouched that of the State in the event of a violation of international law.

the one hand had led to the system of capitulations and on the other
afforded a pretext for intervention in the domestic affairs of States 1,

The similarity of the essential views and objectives of the States of the
three continents of America, Africa and Asia, and the action they are
able to take to develop a positive international law of world-wide ambit,
will tend to direct them toward a universalist concept of law and bring
them back to a system of international adjudication which will no longer
be of an exclusive nature but will, through its effective composition, meet
the wishes expressed in the United Nations Charter, which would have it
represent the main legal systems and principal forms of civilization of the
world.

It is in the light of these preliminary considerations that the connected
problem of diplomatic protection and the jus stand: of the applicant State
should have been approached.

6. It is generally recognized that ‘the attribution of nationality to a
company, or the recognition of its legal allegiance, on the basis of its
siège social or of the law of the place of formation or registration, confer
upon the national State of the company, by virtue of a rule of law en-
shrined in jurisprudence and of a constant practice V7, the right to take
action for the reparation of damage resulting, to the prejudice of the
.company, from an international tort.

Is it, however, necessary in addition that there should exist between the
national State and the company a link of effectiveness, consisting of a
substantial participation in the company by national capital or of control
of the company’s management? Since intervention by a State in favour of
its nationals is a discretionary act, the practice of States which take up a
case for their nationals only on this condition does not give rise to a legal
obligation. Furthermore, no less than a dozen arbitral awards reported
by Mr. J. de Hochepied *® have held that the nationality of the company
alone justified diplomatic intervention. As for those arbitral or judicial
decisions that might be cited in support of the concept of effectiveness or
connection (Canevaro, I'm Alone, Nottebohm cases), they do not amount
to precedents affording any analogy based upon essential factors with

.the question of the nationality of companies in international law. It will be
observed in particular that the Notrebohm Judgment had to determine a
conflict of a particular kind, that of dual nationality. It was based upon
concrete facts peculiar to the situation of the former German citizen
Nottebohm and his endeavours to “substitute for his status as a national

16 Ibid, p. 161. See also S. Prakash Sinha, New Nations and the Law of Nations,

#7 This practice goes back to the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the
United Kingdom intervened with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies on behalf of
19 companies, and it was endorsed by the Committee of Experts of the League of
Nations in 1927. With respect to the jurisprudence, in addition to a number of
arbitral awards at the turn of the century, see the Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway
case, P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 76, p. 16.

of a belligerent State that of a national of a neutral State, with the sole
aim of thus coming within the protection of Liechtenstein” 82, Does not
this reasoning in the Judgment seem to fall into line with the practice of
-the courts or of the administration, taking into account the motive for
the act, of ignoring changes of nationality effected for the purpose of
obtaining, for example, a divorce, or changes of religion or belief in order
to overcome an obstacle to a marriage or to an election, in a State where
seats in the elected chambers are distributed between members of the
country’s various religions and beliefs.

The right of protection of the company by its national State being the
rule, does this right leave room, in appropriate circumstances, for an
action by the national State of the shareholders?

This question relates, within the framework of the third preliminary
objection, to the basic legal condition governing the exercise of inter-
national judicial protection, in other words, to the existence of a rule of
law which would, in the instant case, authorize recourse to a judicial
action. It is of a preliminary nature in relation to the fourth preliminary
objection, concerning the exhaustion of local remedies, as well as to the
other questions raised by the third objection, namely the nationality of
the claim and the connected question of the continuity of the nationality
and that of legal owners and nominees. It is in fact the legal rule which, in
appropriate cases, gives access to the Court. In the absence of this rule,
access to the judicial tribunal is denied the claimant, even if his claim be
absolutely justified from the point of view of such other questions as
might be raised at this preliminary stage of the proceedings.

Since, however, the Court has affirmed the preliminary character of
the question of the possible existence of the legal rule, could it embark
upon one or other of the subsidiary questions and yet manage to avoid, in
the rigour of would-be logical reasoning, disregarding its first decision
and, as it were, going back on itself? That decision had the unavoidable
consequence of putting an end to the proceedings, and it is not open to
anyone to restore it to life in order to embark upon a new discussion which
would not only be obiter dicta, but would be reasoning based upon an
hypothesis which the Court has already rejected, and which would in-
troduce an internal contradiction into the judgment.

This being my point of view on the problem, my separate opinion will
deal only with the legal question the solution of which has of itself, to my
mind, led to the rejection of Belgium’s Application.

7. The question occasions no difficulty if the members of the company
or shareholders complain, ut singuli, of direct damage, as is generally the
case in municipal law; if, in other words, he is injured with respect to
his subjective interests, as distinct from those of the company: e.g., in

18% J.C.J. Reports 1955, p. 26.


BARCELONA TRACTION (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 297

the case of individual despoilment or discriminatory measures. He is then
in the position of any individual claiming the diplomatic or jurisdictional
protection of the State of which he is a national 1°.

But what will be the position if the shareholder’s claim relates to an
indirect injury resulting from a measure which affects the company as
such? The charges which may be expressed as denials of justice, abuse of
right or misuse of power are those which, according to Belgium, affected
the company, beginning with the refusal to allocate foreign currency and
the bankruptcy judgment. It is no longer a question of the corporate
action to be exercised on behalf of the company, but of proceedings
limited to the right or legal interest of the shareholder, to the extent that
he is indirectly injured as a result of a measure affecting the company.

Since the theory of the reality of the personality of companies has
generally been abandoned in favour of the theory of artificial or juridical
personality, it has seemed to certain writers that arbitral awards have taken
a line which, whilst rejecting this fiction to the extent that it is absolute or
excessive, has opened a fresh perspective which is in conformity with the
international character assumed by numerous companies. As between the
right and the fiction, which thus stand opposed io each other, which must
give way? Are we not faced with one of those cases where the adjustment
of law to the reality of human affairs and to the sense of justice must carry
the day?

There is no doubt that the personality attributed to the group of
corporate interests was so attributed with a view to giving to the elements
contained therein and bonded together thereby, common means of action
and effective protection. Accordingly, the moment that that protection
proves insufficient, or even harmful, in the field of international relation-
ships, should not legal personality give way, to the extent that this is
necessary and possible, in favour of a more realistic concept and one which
is more in accordance with the nature of things, that of corporate reality,
in order to leave individuals and capital appropriately revealed, in the
interest of the community and in their own interest?

Is there not ground for thinking that it is above all in the world of
fiction that value-judgments, applied to the law, should be based upon
teleological considerations? Jhering stated that: “The end in view is the
creator of all law.” Let us also recall the proposition of Saleilles, put
forward half a century ago, and which is more mandatory than ever:
“Nothing is important”, he wrote, “other than the object to be attained;
often our most learned constructions serve only to compromise the
realization thereof.” Curiously enough, one of those learned constructions
is the legal fiction. À fiction is indeed “a representation which is con-
trary to the truth”. P. Roubier, to whom I owe this formula, recommends

19 Cf. I. Brownlie, op. cit., p. 401.

“direct enquiry as to what is the object of the legal rule which has thus
been laid down in this dissimulated form 2°”.

It might therefore be considered that the fact of maintaining the fiction
of juristic personality contrary to the avowed interest of its component
parts would create a situation contrary to the object thereof.

And in fact, however stubborn the fiction of juristic personality may be,
as fictions generally are, the diplomatic practice of the creditor Powers
and of capital-exporting countries, as well as certain arbitral decisions,
have not, after the hesitation prior to the First World War, been slow in
accepting, though not without a certain amount of circumspection, the
rule which permits the interests of members or shareholders to be dis-
sociated from the abstract personality covering them and given indepen-
dent consideration—though only where, since the company has the
nationality of the respondent State, an action in the name of the company
could naturally not be brought against the latter except by local means of
redress.

8. However, this arbitral jurisprudence, upon which international
courts have not yet had to pronounce, is neither unanimous nor decisive
on all points,

In the first place, we must leave out of consideration awards given ex
aequo et bono, which are not merely without relevance to the present case,
but are clearly out of place in this discussion. Thus, it should be recalled
that the Special Agreement between the United States and Chile in the
Alsop case empowered the arbitrator to decide in equity and as amiable
compositeur. The same was the case with the awards delivered on the
basis of the 1923 General Convention between the United States and
Mexico, which empowered the arbitral tribunals it set up to decide in
accordance with justice and equity, a customary expression for authori-
zing decisions ex aequo et bono.

Nor can account be taken of awards dealing with partnerships, since
the personality of the members is not absorbed into the corporate person-
ality, as the personality of the shareholders would be in the case of a
joint-stock company 2!; nor of awards dealing with companies described
as “defunct”, or which were obligatorily judged according to the terms of
the Special Agreement 2, nor, finally, of awards couched in uncertain or
ambiguous terms, nor of awards—in particular those given by heads of
State Z—where the absence of reasons for the decision deprives such
awards of any absolute relevance.

The same should be the case for awards suspected of having been given
under the influence of other than juridical motives, or which were pre-
ceded by a demonstration of power, or by threats on the part of a State
which trusted in the force of its arms at least as much as in the force of
its rights 24.

In any case, arbitral precedents and diplomatic practice, supported by
part of Western legal writing, do not amount to, as has been said, “a
coherent body of doctrine”, and consequently do not seem to constitute
a custom to the effect that diplomatic protection, and its judicial sequel,
might cover damage caused by the national State of a company to share-
holders who were aliens in relation to the company. Thus it appears that
it is in treaty law that the protection of foreign investments must be
sought, whether it be a question of companies which have been obliged
to adopt the nationality of the host country, or of nationalizations, “the
scandal of the beginning of the century”, which followed one another at a
rapid rate ever since the First World War, on the part of almost all
countries.

9. Be this first hypothesis as it may, namely that of the shareholders
who have suffered from the activities of the national State of the company,
the problem now to be approached is that of whether diplomatic pro-
tection of shareholders is capable of being extended to the situation
where the damge is attributable to a third State, as in the present case.

It is of course necessary to exclude at the very outset the possibility of
the national State of the shareholders substituting itself for the national
State of the company for the defence of the latter, as Belgium claimed to
do in its Application filed on 23 September 1958. A bond of legal alle-
giance connecting the company to the protecting State is a sine qua non %,
and this does not exist in this case. The problem must be kept confined
within the field of protection of the shareholders themselves. Inter-
national jurisprudence could not adopt the diplomatic practice by which
Belgium seems first to have been inspired, which was that which has been
tried more than once by certain Powers, and which may not be uncon-
nected with the outdated theory of control: first by the United States in
the Chilean Alsop Company, in which the award was given in 1911; then
by the same Government in the Armes automatiques Lewis case, since
from 1927 to 1933 Great Britain had untiringly opposed the action of the
United States, which was the national State of the shareholders, acting
for the protection of the company, which had been formed under Belgian
law; then again by Germany when in 1935 it claimed the right to protect
a Mexican company, and finally by France and Great Britain in the

dispute concerning the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956, when
those two powers thought they could intervene, as national States of the
shareholders, in defence of a company whose original régime attributed
Egyptian nationality to it. In each of these cases, this was to disregard the
essential condition of the bond of nationality or allegiance between the
State intervening and the entity in whose name it was intervening. The
concept of effectiveness, which is not legally required for attribution of
nationality to a company, as a condition of diplomatic protection, cannot
operate either to transfer to the national State of the shareholders the
right of diplomatic protection of the company itself, which right is an
attribute of the company’s national State. It has of course been pointed
out that it was with shareholders’ representatives that the United Arab
Republic negotiated an agreement concerning the Egyptian Suez Canal
Company, as Mr. E. Lauterpacht reports. But those negotiations do not
involve recognition of the right to bring an action at law ; they amount to an
ex gratia action, not implying any legal responsibility, as was the case of
the provisions of the Agreement of 8 September 1923 between the Uni-
ted States and Mexico which set up the Special Claims Commission.

Thus Belgium refrained, in its Application of 19 June 1962, from
claiming to protect the Barcelona Traction company, contrary to what it
had done in its first Application, already quoted, of 23 September 1958,
and limited its claim from then on to the protection of the shareholders
of its own nationality. Since this latter Application was deemed to have
lapsed as a result of its withdrawal by the applicant Government, and
that Government furthermore made no mention of it in its final sub-
missions, the Court only has to deal with the new Application, in-
dependently of the earlier one. This was the effect of the decision of the
German-Mexican Commission when it accepted the fresh submissions
presented by Germany on behalf of German shareholders, after the
error which it had made by claiming the right to protect the Mexican
company itself 2.

10. Since the right of the State to protect its nationals who have been
injured by acts, decisions, omissions or measures contrary to inter-
national law, and imputable to another State, is undeniable, it would be
useful to seek to ascertain the nature or legal foundation thereof, in
order to deduce from it the legal consequences and the extent of its
application raised by the present case. The question upon which it would
be useful to pronouce is that of whether diplomatic protection derives
from a general principle of law recognized by the nations (Article 38,
para. 1 (c), of the Court’s Statute) or from an international custom
(para. 1 (b) of that Article).

taken any stand on this point, when it stated, with some emphasis, in an
axiomatic form that diplomatic protection “is an elementary principle of
international law”. One cannot hazard a guess as to the sense in which the
expression “elementary principle” was taken, given as it is without any
other qualification. And when other judgments have referred to this
precedent, they do not seem to have been any more explicit. The ter-
minology of the two international Courts does not permit of there being
attributed to them, on this point, an opinion which they seem designedly
to have kept in petto, following a prudent practice which has already been
remarked on .

It is true that a special tribunal, the Mixed Claims Commission
{United States and Germany), set up as a result of the First World War,
decided in more than one case—namely the Vinland, Standard Oil, Sun
Oil and Pierce Oil cases—that the intervention of the national State of
the shareholders “is based on a general principle which such State would
have relied on even in the absence of preliminary agreement”. However,
that Commission did not explain whether it understood by “general
principle” a general principle of law recognized by the nations, or a
principle drawn directly from the idea of law. It is nonetheless the case
that its jurisprudence, although approved by some authors, though not
many, has not been corroborated by other jurisdictions. The opinions of
legal writers are also divided. Nor was this the first nor the only time that
a rule of international law has been considered by some to be a custom-
ary norm, and by others to be a general principle of law recognized by
the nations, and by others again to be a principle drawn directly from the
idea of law. The problem would obviously not be resolved were one to
content oneself with the observation that the frontiers between these
various concepts are still blurred or uncertain. This is the case of the
rule of exhaustion of local remedies, which is the subject-matter of the
fourth preliminary objection in the present case, and which is based
now on the one, now on the other, of the first two concepts #. Further-
more, the principle of protection of human rights, which will be referred
to below, has been considered to be capable of constituting a legal norm
at one and the same time on the basis of the three principal sources of
international law, namely: international conventions, international
custom, and the general principles of law 3.

11. If my view is accepted, that diplomatic protection and the possible
right of the shareholder do not derive from a principle of international
law recognized by the nations, it remains to be considered whether the
