I have voted in favour of most of the operative part of the Judgment,
principally because I concur with the Court’s finding, in response to the
questions submitted to it in the Special Agreement, that Hungary was not
entitled to suspend and subsequently to abandon in 1989 the works on
the Nagymaros Project and on the part of the Gabéikovo Project on the
Danube river for which it was responsible under the 1977 Treaty, that the
Treaty continues to be in force and consequently governs the relationship
between the Parties.

In making such a finding the Court not only reached the right decision
in my view, but reached a decision which is in accordance with the 1977
Treaty, and is consistent with the jurisprudence of the Court as well as
the general principles of international law. Foremost among these prin-
ciples is that of pacta sunt servanda which forms an integral part of inter-
national law. Any finding to the contrary would have been tantamount to
denying respect for obligations arising from treaties, and would also have
undermined one of the fundamental principles and objectives of the
United Nations Charter calling upon States “to establish conditions
under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties

. can be maintained”, and “to achieve international co-operation in
solving problems of an economic, social . . . character”.

taken by the Parties prior to the conclusion of the Treaty. The Treaty
itself, in its Articles 15, 19 and 20, imposed strict obligations regarding



the protection of the environment which were to be met and complied
with by the contracting parties in the construction and operation of the
Project.

When in 1989 Hungary, concerned about the effects of the Project on
its natural environment, suspended and later abandoned works for which
it was responsible under the 1977 Treaty this was tantamount to a viola-
tion not only of the Treaty itself but of the principle of pacta sunt ser-
vanda.

The Court in its Judgment, quite rightly in my view, acknowledges
Hungary’s genuine concerns about the effect of the Project on its natural
environment. However, after careful consideration of the conflicting evi-
dence, it reached the conclusion that it was not necessary to determine
which of these points of view was scientifically better founded in order to
answer the question put to it in the Special Agreement. Hungary had not
established to the satisfaction of the Court that the construction of the
Project would have led to the consequences it alleged. Further, even
though such damages might occur, they did not appear imminent in
terms of the law, and could otherwise have been prevented or redressed.
The Court, moreover, stated that such uncertainties as might have existed
and had raised environmental concerns in Hungary could otherwise have
been addressed without having to resort to unilateral suspension and ter-
mination of the Treaty. In effect, the evidence was not of such a nature as
to entitle Hungary to unilaterally suspend and later terminate the Treaty
on grounds of ecological necessity. In the Court’s view, to allow that
would not only destabilize the security of treaty relations but would also
severely undermine the principle of pacta sunt servanda.

I also concur with the Court’s findings that Czechoslovakia was
entitled to proceed, in November 1991, to Variant C in so far as it then
confined itself to undertaking works which did not predetermine its final
decision. On the other hand, I cannot concur with the Court’s finding
that Czechoslovakia was not entitled to put Variant C into operation
from October 1992. The Court reached this latter conclusion after hold-

It is against this background that the Court also reaffirmed the prin-
ciple of international law that, subject to the appropriate limitations, a
State party to a treaty, when confronted with a refusal by the other party
to perform its part of an agreed project, is free to act on its own territory
and within its own jurisdiction so as to realize the original object and
purpose of the treaty, thereby limiting for itself the damage sustained
and, ultimately, the compensatory damages to be paid by the other party.

The Court also found that, in operating Variant C, Slovakia essentially
appropriated for its own use and benefit between 80 and 90 per cent of
the waters of the Danube before returning them to the main bed of the
river downstream of Gabéikovo. This act, in the Court's view, deprived
Hungary of its right to an equitable share of the natural resources of the
river, this being not only a shared international watercourse but an inter-
national boundary river.

In the light of these findings, the Court concluded that Czechoslovakia,
by putting into operation Variant C, did not apply the Treaty, but, on the
contrary, violated certain of its express provisions and in so doing com-
mitted an internationally wrongful act. In its reasoning, the Court stated
that it had placed emphasis on the “putting into operation” of Variant C,
the unlawfulness residing in the damming of the Danube.

This finding by the Court calls for comment. In the first place, it is to
be recalled that the Court found that Hungary’s suspension and uni-
lateral termination of the Treaty was unlawful. Secondly, the Court held
that a State party confronted, as Czechoslovakia was, with a refusal by
the other party to perform its part of an agreed project is entitled to act
on its own territory and within its own jurisdiction so as to realize the
object and purpose of the treaty. This notwithstanding, the Court took
exception to the fact that Variant C did not meet the requirements of
Articles 1, 8, 9 and 10 of the 1977 Treaty regarding a “single and opera-
tional system of locks”, “joint ownership” and “use and benefits of the
system of locks in equal measure”. In its view, “by definition all this
could not be carried out by unilateral measure”. This stricture of Variant
C is not, in my respectful opinion, warranted. The unilateral suspension
and termination of the Treaty and the works for which Hungary was
responsible under it had amounted not only to a repudiation of the
Treaty; it frustrated the realization of the Project as a single and opera-
tional system of works, jointly owned and used for the benefit of the con-
tracting parties in equal measure. As a result of Hungary’s acts, the
objective of the original Project could only have been achieved by Slo-
vakia alone operating it; according to the material before the Court,
Variant C constituted the minimum modification of the original Project
necessary to enable the aim and objective of the original Project to be



realized. It should be recalled that but for the suspension and abandon-
ment of the works, there would have been no Variant C, and without
Variant C, the objective of the act of Hungary which the Court has quali-
fied as unlawful would have been realized thus defeating the object and
purpose of the Treaty. In my view Variant C was therefore a genuine
application of the Treaty and it was indispensable for the realization of
its object and purpose. If it had not proceeded to its construction,
according to the material before the Court, Czechoslovakia would have
been stranded with a largely finished but inoperative system, which had
been very expensive both in terms of cost of construction and in terms of
acquiring the necessary land. The environmental benefits in terms of
flood control, which was a primary object and purpose of the Treaty,
would not have been attained. Additionally, the unfinished state of the
constructions would have exposed them to further deterioration through
continued inoperation.

Variant C was also held to be unlawful by the Court because, in its
opinion, Czechoslovakia, by diverting the waters of the Danube to oper-
ate Variant C, unilaterally assumed control of a shared resource and
thereby deprived Hungary of its right to an equitable share of the natural
resources of the river — with the continuing effects of the diversion of

While it is acknowledged that the waters of rivers must not be used in
such a way as to cause injury to other States and in the absence of any
settled rules an equitable solution must be sought (case of the Diversion
of Water from the Meuse, Judgment, 1937, P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 70),
this rule applies where a treaty is absent. In the case under consideration
Article 14, paragraph 2, of the 1977 Treaty provides that the contracting
parties may, without giving prior notice, both withdraw from the Hun-
garian-Czechoslovak section of the Danube, and subsequently make use
of the quantities of water specified in the water balance of the approved
Joint Contractual Plan. Thus, the withdrawal of excess quantities of
water from the Hungarian-Czechoslovak section of the Danube to oper-
ate the Gabtikovo section of the system was contemplated with compen-
sation to the other party in the form of an increased share of electric
power. In other words, Hungary had agreed within the context of the
Project to the diversion of the Danube (and, in the Joint Contractual
Plan, to a provisional measure of withdrawal of water from the Danube).
Accordingly, it would appear that the normal entitlement of the Parties



to an equitable and reasonable share of the water of the Danube under
general international law was duly modified by the 1977 Treaty which
considered the Project as a lex specialis. Slovakia was thus entitled to
divert enough water to operate Variant C, and more especially so if, with-
out such diversion, Variant C could not have been put into productive
use. It is difficult to appreciate the Court’s finding that this action was
unlawful in the absence of an explanation as to how Variant C should
have been put into operation. On the contrary, the Court would appear
to be saying by implication that, if Variant C had been operated on the
basis of a 50-50 sharing of the waters of the Danube, it would have been
lawful. However, the Court has not established that a 50-50 ratio of use
would have been sufficient to operate Variant C optimally. Nor could the
Court say that the obligations of the Parties under the Treaty had been
infringed or that the achievement of the objectives of the Treaty had been
defeated by the diversion. In the case concerning the Diversion of Water
from the Meuse, the Court found that, in the absence of a provision
requiring the consent of Belgium, “the Netherlands are entitled . . . to
dispose of the waters of the Meuse at Maestricht” provided that the treaty
obligations incumbent on it were not ignored (Judgment, 1937, P.C.LJ.,
Series A/B, No. 70, p. 30). Applying this test in the circumstances which
arose, Variant C can be said to have been permitted by the 1977 Treaty
as a reasonable method of implementing it. Consequently Variant C did
not violate the rights of Hungary and was consonant with the objectives

In the light of the foregoing considerations, I take the view that the
operation of Variant C should have been considered as a genuine attempt
by an injured party to secure the achievement of the agreed objectives of
the 1977 Treaty, in ways not only consistent with that Treaty but with
international law and equity.
