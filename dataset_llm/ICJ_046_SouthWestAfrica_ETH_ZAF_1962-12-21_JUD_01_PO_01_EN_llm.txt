The Court concludes that Article 7 of the Mandate is a treaty or
convention still in force within the meaning of Article 37 of the
Statute of the Court and that the dispute is one which is envisaged
in the said Article 7 and cannot be settled by negotiation. Conse-
quently the Court is competent to hear the dispute on the merits.

finds that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the merits of the
dispute.

Although the interest of the Governments of Liberia and Ethiopia
that the Court should pass upon the violations by South Africa of
the Mandate for South West Africa alleged by those Governments
is entirely comprehensible, it is not possible for me to follow the
reasoning of the Court which leadsit to hold that it has jurisdiction.

Can it readily be found that the Mandate is a “treaty or conven-
tion” within the meaning of Article 37 of the Statute of the Inter-
national Court of Justice; that the Mandate, as a “treaty”, survived
the collapse of the League of Nations (of which the formal act of
“dissolution” of the League of Nations was the result); that
Article 7 of the Mandate—assuming the Mandate to be in force—



can be relied on by States none of which is a “Member of the
League of Nations”, that organization no longer being in existence?

It appears to me that any attempt to give an affirmative answer
to these questions, and they are not the only ones which arise, must
necessarily be based on arguments which, from the standpoint of
law, do not seem to me to have sufficient weight.

In these circumstances it is not possible for me to concur in the
Court’s conclusion. To be upheld, the Court’s jurisdiction must be
very clearly and unequivocally established, and that does not seem
to me to be the case here.
