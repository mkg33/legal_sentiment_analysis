   1. This declaration explains my vote on the alleged complicity of the
Respondent, in breach of Article III (e) of the Genocide Convention, in
the genocide committed at Srebrenica in July 1995. In summary, my posi-
tion on the law is that the Respondent, as an alleged accomplice, must be
proved to have knowledge of the genocidal intent of the principal perpe-
trator (but need not share that intent) and, with that knowledge, to have
provided aid and assistance to the perpetrator. My position on the facts
is that those two elements are proved to the necessary standard.

   2. The reasons for my conclusion on the law that it is sufficient in
terms of Article III (e) to establish that the accomplice knew that the
principal perpetrator had genocidal intent, relate to the definition and the
nature of complicity in unlawful acts, the purpose of the prohibition on
complicity in genocide, and the case law.

   3. Dictionary definitions of “complicity” and “(ac)complice” provide
both narrower and broader meanings. To put the matter in legal terms,
the narrower meaning appears to equate complicity with aiding and abet-
ting (or assisting) while the broader meaning also includes a co-author or
co-perpetrator of the offence. Thus the Oxford English Dictionary (OED
Online, 2nd ed., 1989) defines “complice” as “[o]ne associated in any
affair with another, the latter being regarded as the principal”, and also
as a “confederate” or “comrade”, words apt to include a co-perpetrator.
And Le Petit Robert (electronic version, version 2, 2001) defines “com-
plicité” as participation by intentional assistance in the breach committed
by another and in terms of agreement or entente. Legal dictionaries
also include narrower and broader approaches. Gérard Cornu, Vocabu-
laire Juridique (7th ed., 2005, p. 188), drawing on Articles 121-6 and
121-7 of the French Penal Code, defines “complicité” as a contribution
to the realization of a breach by aid or assistance to the author of
the offence, or by instigation ; a “complice” in his definition is contrasted
with a principal author or co-author ; see similarly Jean Salmon,
Dictionnaire de droit international public (2001, pp. 218-219).
Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed., Vol. 11, para. 43), says that
persons are accomplices if they are participants in the offence charged,



whether as principals, procurers, aiders or abettors. Mellinkoff’s Diction-
ary of American Legal Usage (1992, p. 463), defines “accomplice” as “a
general term for a person who participates with others in the commission
of a crime, whether as principal or accessory”, with the last word
being equated with “someone who aids and abets”. My final reference
is to a publication of the United Nations Office at Geneva, Law
Terminology in English, French and Spanish (1990, p. 196). It help-
fully distinguishes between the broader and narrower sense of “complice” ;
in the broader sense, the accomplice is the person who participates in
the crime or wrong of another, including as a co-author ; and in the
narrower, by contrast to a co-author, the person who participates as an
accessory.




  4. As those definitions show, complicity is often equated in whole or in
part with aiding and abetting. The present aspect of the case is concerned
with complicity only in the sense of aiding and abetting. I agree with the
Court that the Applicant has not established that the Respondent is in
breach of its obligation, as a principal, not to commit genocide. I now
turn to the mental element required if complicity in this more restricted
sense is to be established.

   5. In many national legal systems aiders and abettors need only be
aware that they are aiding the principal perpetrator in the commission of
its offence by their contribution (see e.g. the law of France, Germany,
Switzerland, England, Canada, Australia and some of the states of the
United States referred to in Prosecutor v. Krstić, IT 98-33-A, Judgment
of 19 April 2004, para. 141). More significantly, the Appeals Chamber of
the ICTY in Krstić, following earlier decisions, has ruled consistently
with that body of national law that “an individual who aids and abets a
specific intent offense may be held responsible if he assists the commis-
sion of the crime knowing the intent behind the crime” (Krstić, para. 140).
Having recalled that consistent jurisprudence and principle, the Chamber
applied it to the prohibition of genocide stated in its Statute, the wording
of which is taken directly from Article II of the Genocide Convention.


  6. That understanding of the mental element required by complicity
when it is limited to aiding and abetting serves the purpose of sanctioning
the actions of those who knowingly assist the unlawful act of the primary
perpetrator, knowing in particular of the primary perpetrator’s genocidal




intent. The necessary intent of the aider and abettor is the intent to pro-
vide the means by which the perpetrator may realize his own intent to
commit genocide. As Judge Shahabuddeen said in paragraph 67 of his
opinion in Krstić, those preparing the text of the Genocide Convention
could not have failed to criminalize the actions of the commercial sup-
pliers of poisonous gas who knew of the intent of the purchasers to use
the gas for the purpose of destroying a national, ethnical, racial or reli-
gious group, even if the suppliers themselves did not share that intent.
   7. It is true that the Appeals Chamber in Krstić did go on to suggest
that, for complicity to be established in some circumstances, the accom-
plice had to share the principal’s intent (Prosecutor v. Krstić, IT 98-33-A,
Judgment of 19 April 2004, para. 142). But, because that suggestion is
expressly limited to conduct broader than aiding and abetting, as well as
being unnecessary for the decision in that case (as the Chamber acknowl-
edges at footnote 247), it is irrelevant to the present case. Further, the
two reasons the Chamber gives for its suggestion are unpersuasive. The
first reason — the natural reading of Article III (e) — is merely asserted.
Moreover, that reading would necessarily have to apply to aiding and
abetting as well as to the broader matters encompassed within Arti-
cle III (e), an application which would contradict the Chamber’s main
ruling that knowledge is sufficient for aiding and abetting. That problem
also arises with the second argument based on an examination of the
drafting history in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly in 1948.
In any event, that history is better read as requiring that the alleged
accomplice know that the principal perpetrator has the necessary intent,
not that the alleged accomplice share it (United Nations, Official Records
of the General Assembly, Third Session, Sixth Committee, Summary
Records of the 87th meeting, pp. 254-259). The discussion on the pro-
posed amendment (which was to add the word “deliberate” before “com-
plicity” but which was withdrawn on the basis that complicity in geno-
cide must be “deliberate”) indicates that the actions had to be “deliberate”
in the sense of knowing of the perpetrator’s intent ; the intent did not
have to be shared.

   8. I now turn to the facts and to the question whether the Applicant
has shown that the Respondent, knowing of the perpetrator’s genocidal
intent, continued to supply the perpetrators with the means to facilitate
the realization of that intent. There can be no possible dispute about that
supply and its continuation. It is seen in the very extensive involvement

  9. But did the Respondent have the necessary knowledge in the very
short time the Srebrenica massacre was undertaken, essentially from 13
to 16 July 1995 ? My primary specific source in answering that question is
the 1999 Report of the United Nations Secretary-General, “The Fall of
Srebrenica” (A/54/549, Ch. VIII) ; see paragraphs 228-230 of the Judg-
ment of the Court.


   16. Accordingly, I conclude that the Respondent was complicit in the
genocide committed at Srebrenica in July 1995 in breach of Article
III (e) of the Genocide Convention.
