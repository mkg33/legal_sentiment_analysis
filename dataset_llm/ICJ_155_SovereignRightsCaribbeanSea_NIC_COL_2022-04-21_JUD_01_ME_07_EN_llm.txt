                      1. I am in agreement with the Court’s finding that Colombia has
                    breached Nicaragua’s sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone
                    (hereinafter “EEZ”). In this opinion I make some observations on the
                    Court’s treatment of a coastal State’s sovereign rights in its EEZ. I treat
                    Articles 56, 58, 61, 62, 69, 70 and 73 as reflecting customary international
                    law.

                       2. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter
                    “UNCLOS” or “the Convention” or “the Montego Bay Convention”)
                    makes two novel and monumental contributions to the law of the sea in
                    its adoption of the concepts of an exclusive economic zone and the
                    ­common heritage of mankind. This case concerns the nature and scope of
                     the rights and obligations of States in the EEZ under customary law.

                       3. The EEZ was a revolutionary concept that had received such wide-
                    spread acceptance by States that in 1985, three years after the adoption of
                    the Montego Bay Convention, the Court in Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/
                    Malta determined that it had achieved the status of a rule of customary
                    international law 1. In a real sense the EEZ was the central pillar in the

                       4. During the UNCLOS negotiations, a principal issue was whether
                    the EEZ was a zone of the high seas or a zone of national jurisdiction.
                    The Montego Bay Convention does not answer this question directly. It
                    provides a set of interlocking rights and duties to govern the relationship
                    between the coastal State and other States in relation to the EEZ.

                       5. Article 56 (2) of the Convention provides that the coastal State must
                    exercise its sovereign rights and perform its duties in the EEZ “hav[ing]
                    due regard to the rights and duties of other States”. However, Arti-
                    cle 58 (3) of the Convention also provides that “[i]n exercising their rights
                    and performing their duties under this Convention in the exclusive eco-
                    nomic zone, States shall have due regard to the rights and duties of the
                    coastal State”. By these provisions, the Montego Bay Convention
                    attempts to strike a balance between the rights and duties of the coastal
                    State in the EEZ and the rights — especially freedom of navigation and
                       1 Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1985,

                    p. 33, para. 34.

                    overflight — and duties of other States in that zone. The many cases
                    that have been decided in relation to the EEZ have not succeeded
                    in unravelling the mysteries of the phrase “due regard”. An important
                    issue is whether the “due regard” provision gives rise to procedural or
                    substantive obligations. The balance between the coastal States’ rights,
                    jurisdiction and duties in the EEZ on the one hand and the rights and
                    duties of other States in that zone on the other is indeed a very delicate
                    one.

                       6. The EEZ is a zone sui generis and its special character is described
                    in Article 55 of the Convention, which provides that it is
                          “an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the
                          specific legal régime established in this Part, under which the rights
                          and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of
                          other States are governed by the relevant provisions of this Conven-
                          tion”.
                       7. Some commentators 2 maintain that Article 56 is a “relevant provi-
                    sion” within the meaning of Article 58 (1) of the Convention, which pro-
                    vides that “in the exclusive economic zone, all States, whether coastal or
                    landlocked, enjoy, subject to the relevant provisions of this Convention,
                    the freedoms referred to in article 87 of navigation and overflight”. If this
                    interpretation is correct, the freedom of navigation of other States in the
                    EEZ would be enjoyed, subject to the coastal State’s sovereign rights in
                    its EEZ to explore, exploit, conserve and manage its living and non-­living
                    resources; in effect, the freedoms enjoyed by other States in the EEZ
                    would be subordinated to the coastal State’s sovereign rights in that zone.
                    It was never the intention in the negotiations of the Convention to address
                    the relationship between the sovereign rights of the coastal State in
                    its EEZ and the rights and duties of other States in that zone in any-
                    thing as stark and categorical as a “subject to” formulation. This rela-

                          the other provisions of the Convention. The difference is that these freedoms are
                          subject to measures relating to the sovereign rights of the coastal State in the zone,
                          and they are not subject to such measures or those rights beyond the zone”; 

                    Sea (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press, 2015: page 135 refers to the “subject to” provi-
                    sion in Article 58 (1) as creating a rebuttable presumption in favour of the coastal State in
                    the event of a conflict between the sovereign rights of the coastal State and the enjoyment
                    by other States of the four high seas freedoms set out in that Article.

                       8. Case law does not appear to support the conclusion that Article 56
                    is a relevant provision within the meaning of Article 58 (1) of the Mon-
                    tego Bay Convention. In its Judgment in M/V “Virginia G”, the Interna-
                    tional Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (hereinafter “ITLOS” or the
                    “Tribunal”) had to consider Panama’s submission that bunkering fell
                    “within the category of freedom of navigation and other internationally
                    lawful uses of the sea related to that freedom in terms of Article 58 (1)” 3.
                    The Tribunal held that Article 58 “is to be read together with article 56”.
                    It rejected Panama’s argument, holding that, in exercise of its sovereign
                    rights to conserve and manage the living resources in its EEZ, the coastal
                    State was entitled under Article 56 (1) to adopt measures to control bun-
                    kering of fishing vessels in that zone. The Tribunal arrived at this decision
                    without making any mention of Article 56 as a relevant provision for the
                    purposes of Article 58 (1). It is reasonable to conclude that the Tribunal
                    arrived at its decision by applying the general rule of interpretation set
                    out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (here-
                    inafter the “VCLT”). By this process, the Tribunal decided that the nature
                    of the sovereign rights enjoyed by coastal States in their EEZs was such
                    that the coastal State was entitled to adopt measures in respect of bunker-
                    ing of fishing vessels in their EEZs. If the enjoyment of freedom of navi-
                    gation in the EEZ of a coastal State is subject to the sovereign rights of
                    the coastal State in that zone, a dispute concerning the two sets of rights
                    would always be resolved in favour of the coastal State’s sovereign rights,
                    because those rights would always prevail over freedom of navigation. It
                    is not merely, as one commentator maintains, that the “subject to” for-
                    mulation creates “a rebuttable presumption in favour of the coastal State
                    in the event of a conflict” between the two sets of rights 4; rather, it is that

                    the sovereign rights of the coastal State by making the enjoyment of that
                    freedom wholly dependent on the coastal State’s sovereign rights. A
                    rebuttable presumption might have been created if the phrase used in
                    Article 58 (1) was “taking into account” instead of “subject to”. In the
                    present case, in which the two sets of rights are pitted against each other,
                    the Court could readily have resolved Nicaragua’s claim — that Colom-
                    bia by its activities breached Nicaragua’s sovereign rights in its EEZ — in
                    favour of Nicaragua, on the basis that Colombia’s enjoyment of freedom
                    of navigation is subordinated to Nicaragua’s sovereign rights. But the
                    Court does not take that approach. It finds that freedom of navigation
                    does not permit Colombia to engage in the activities it carried out in

                    Nicaragua’s EEZ. In answering Nicaragua’s claim, the Court makes no
                    mention of Article 56 as a relevant provision for the purposes of Arti-
                    cle 58 (1). Moreover, the question whether, in exercising its rights and
                    performing its duties, Colombia has had due regard to the rights and
                    duties of Nicaragua does not arise, if Colombia’s freedom of navigation
                    is subject to Nicaragua’s sovereign rights. If the right of freedom of navi-
                    gation enjoyed by other States in a coastal State’s EEZ is subject to the
                    sovereign rights of the coastal State in that zone, the Convention would
                    provide a definitive answer to the question whether the zone is a zone of
                    the high seas or a zone of national jurisdiction. The Convention never
                    provided this answer in a clear and unambiguous way. The murky rela-
                    tionship between the two sets of rights is addressed by the equally murky
                    due-­regard obligations in Articles 56 (2) and 58 (3). An example of a “rel-

                    out in Nicaragua’s EEZ, breached Nicaragua’s sovereign rights under
                    Article 56 (1) (a) to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living and
                    non-­living resources in its EEZ. In general, Colombia answers this claim
                    by contending that its activities were carried out in exercise of its freedom
                    of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea under Arti-
                    cle 58 (1) of UNCLOS. The Court found that


                          “freedoms of navigation and overflight enjoyed by other States in the
                          exclusive economic zone of the coastal State, as reflected in Article 58
                          of UNCLOS, do not include rights relating to the exploration,
                          exploitation, conservation and management of the natural resources
                          of the maritime zone, nor do they give other States jurisdiction to
                          enforce conservation measures in the exclusive economic zone of the
                          coastal State. Such rights and jurisdiction are specifically reserved for

                             Articles 56 and 73 of UNCLOS.” (Judgment, para. 94.)

                    This conclusion would be more persuasive were it based on an analysis of
                    the nature and scope of the two sets of rights. The right to freedom of
                    navigation under Article 58 (1) does not exist in isolation or in the
                    abstract; the right is to freedom of navigation in the EEZ, and there is a
                    necessary and inevitable interaction between the two sets of rights. This
                    explains why the analysis would be strengthened by an examination of
                    the nature and scope of the two sets of rights; for example, the analysis
                    might show that the sovereign rights of the coastal State, despite being
                    sovereign, are so qualified as to allow for the types of activities carried
                    out by Colombia. On the contrary, however, it is argued in this opinion
                    that an analysis of the sovereign rights of the coastal State in its EEZ
                    shows that those rights are exclusive to the coastal State in the sense that
                    they may not be exercised by any other State without the consent of the
                    coastal State.

                    bia’s response call for an examination of the rights, duties and jurisdic-
                    tion of the coastal State in its EEZ, as well as the nature of the rights and
                    freedoms of other States in the zone.

                       11. Freedom of navigation can be traced to the right of unimpeded
                    navigation on the high seas that was trumpeted by Hugo Grotius in his
                    famous treatise Mare Liberum (1609) 5. In the Montego Bay Convention,
                    it is treated substantively in two provisions. Article 87 (1) provides that
                    “[t]he high seas are open to all States, whether coastal or landlocked.
                    Freedom of the high seas is exercised under the conditions laid down by
                    this Convention and by other rules of international law.” The Article then
                    lists six freedoms, the first three of which are freedom of navigation, free-
                    dom of overflight, and freedom to lay submarine cables. Article 58 (1)
                    provides that, in the EEZ,
                             “all States, whether coastal or land-­locked, enjoy, subject to the rel-
                             evant provisions of this Convention, the freedoms referred to in arti-
                             cle 87 of navigation and overflight and of the laying of submarine
                             cables and pipelines, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea
                             related to these freedoms, such as those associated with the operation
                             of ships, aircraft and submarine cables and pipelines, and compatible
                             with the other provisions of this Convention”.

                    416 	 sovereign rights and maritime spaces (sep. op. robinson)

                    As a result of the formulation of Article 58 (1), the freedom of fishing,
                    reflected in Article 87 (1) (e), is not among the high seas freedoms enjoyed
                    by a third State in the EEZ of a coastal State.
                       12. The phrase “freedom of navigation” must be interpreted in accor-
                    dance with the customary rules of interpretation. The ordinary meaning
                    of the term “navigation” is to be ascertained in the context in which it is
                    used in Articles 58 and 87 of the Montego Bay Convention, and in light
                    of the Convention’s object and purpose. Dictionaries give several mean-
                    ings of the word “navigation”. In the context in which the term is used in
                    these Articles, the most instructive meanings are the “passage of ships”
                    (Oxford English Dictionary) and the “movement of ships” (Collins Dic‑
                    tionary). In the context, therefore, of Part V of the Convention, and in
                    light of the object and purpose of the Convention, freedom of navigation
                    is the freedom enjoyed by a third State of the passage or movement of its
                    ships in the EEZ of a coastal State, without any entitlement on the part
                    of the coastal State to restrict that passage or movement in any way,
                    unless there is carried out on the ship an activity that interferes with the
                    enjoyment by the coastal State of its sovereign rights.

                    on the high seas under Article 87. This is so because the freedom is being
                    exercised in the EEZ of a coastal State and, naturally, the sovereign rights
                    of the coastal State to explore, exploit, conserve and manage its living
                    and non-­living resources will impact on a third State’s freedom of naviga-
                    tion in the zone. If there is carried out, on a ship passing or moving
                    through the EEZ of a coastal State, any activity that interferes with the
                    sovereign rights of the coastal State and which, therefore, is not directly
                    related to that passage or movement, that ship is not exercising freedom
                    of navigation under Article 58, and it would have violated the sovereign
                    rights of the coastal State. The Virginia Commentary observes that many
                    coastal States take the position that military activities are not protected
                    within the EEZ and that the coastal State may oppose such exercises by
                    foreign ships on the basis that they may affect the living resources or the
                    marine environment or the safety of navigation 6. The activities carried
                    out by Colombian naval vessels of harassing Nicaraguan fishermen and
                    stopping Nicaraguan fishing vessels or other Nicaraguan-­licensed vessels
                    in order to apply what Colombia considers to be proper conservation
                    methods, do not fall within the scope of the freedom of navigation under
                    Article 58 and would constitute a breach of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights
                    to explore, exploit, conserve and manage its natural resources, including
                    fishing.

                       14. There is evidence that on an occasion when Colombian military
                    vessels carried out patrols in Nicaragua’s EEZ, the Colombian President
                    asserted, “[w]e find ourselves patrolling and exercising sovereignty over
                    Colombian waters” (my emphasis); there is also evidence that at that time
                    the Colombians were in fact in Nicaragua’s EEZ. In such a situation, the
                    activity of patrolling has no direct relationship with the passage or move-
                    ment of the Colombian ship, and Colombia is not exercising freedom of
                    navigation; rather, it is engaging in intimidating conduct that flagrantly
                    interferes with Nicaragua’s exclusive sovereign rights in its EEZ for the
                    purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the living and
                    non-­living resources of the zone.

                    sovereign rights of a coastal State in its EEZ are such as to preclude
                    Colombia from engaging in the activities that it carried out in Nicara-
                    gua’s EEZ. In that regard, it should be determined whether the sovereign
                    rights of Nicaragua in its EEZ are exclusive in the sense that they may not
                    be exercised by any other State without the consent of Nicaragua as the
                    coastal State. If Nicaragua as the coastal State has exclusive sovereign
                    rights for the purpose of the exploration, exploitation, conservation and
                    management of the living and non-­living resources of the EEZ, this would
                    be a cogent basis for finding that Colombia’s interventionist activities in
                    Nicaragua’s EEZ breached Nicaragua’s sovereign rights in that zone.

                      17. It is not merely, as the Court holds, that rights relating to the
                    exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of the natural


                    resources of the EEZ, as well as the power to design conservation policies
                    for the zone, are “specifically reserved for the coastal State”; rather, it is
                    that they are exclusively reserved for the coastal State. The history of the
                    development of the concept of an EEZ, the negotiations preceding the

                       18. Undeniably, it was a developmental consideration that prompted
                    developing countries in the last part of the twentieth century to insist on
                    a zone of what was then the high seas as an area in which they would be
                    entitled to explore and exploit the living and non-­living resources. Thus,
                    in explaining the rationale behind the concept of the EEZ to the Asia-­
                    Africa Legal Consultative Group in 1971, Kenya pointed out that the
                    régime of the high seas benefited developed countries which, unlike devel-
                    oping countries, had ships that could carry out distant water fishing off
                    the coasts of developing countries in maritime areas that were then part
                    of the high seas. In the interest of their growth and development, those
                    developing States sought exclusive, not shared, sovereign rights in rela-
                    tion to fisheries. Indeed, from as far back as 1952, Chile, Ecuador and
                    Peru declared that they possessed “exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction
                    over the sea along the coasts of their respective countries to a minimum
                    distance of 200 nautical miles from their coasts” 7. Kenya’s proposal
                    in 1974 to the first session of the Conference was that



                          “in the exclusive economic zone a coastal State shall have sovereignty
                          over the living and non-­living resources. It shall have sovereign rights
                          for the purpose of regulation, control, exploration, exploitation, pro-
                          tection and preservation of all living and non-­living resources there-
                          in.” 8
                    The element of exclusivity was emphasized in the provision in Kenya’s
                    proposal that, “subject to Article 6” — relating to the rights of land-
                    locked and geographically disadvantaged States — “no other State has
                    the right to explore and exploit the resources therein without the consent
                    or agreement of the coastal States” 9. In fact, the near unanimity on the
                    concept of an EEZ establishing exclusive sovereign rights of the coastal

                        20. The Chamber of the Court acknowledged this element of
                    e­ xclusivity in the Gulf of Maine case. The Chamber spoke plainly when it
                     held:
                             “But after the coastal States had set up exclusive 200-mile fishery
                          zones, the situation radically altered. Third States and their nationals
                          found themselves deprived of any right of access to the sea areas
                          within those zones and of any position of advantage they might have
                          been able to achieve within them. As for the United States, any mere
                          factual predominance which it had been able to secure in the area was
                          transformed into a situation of legal monopoly to the extent that the
                          localities in question became legally part of its own exclusive fishery
                          zone.” 11

                    placed because, in its view, it merely stands for the proposition that pri-
                    vate practice has no impact on maritime delimitation and does not
                    address the impact of maritime delimitation on vested rights. However, a
                    careful reading of the Judgment shows that the Chamber did not accept
                    the argument for historic rights. The Chamber held that it would not
                    “ascribe any decisive weight, for the purposes of the delimitation it [was]
                    charged to carry out, to the antiquity or continuity of fishing activities
                    carried on in the past within that part of the delimitation area” 12. In its
                    delimitation of the exclusive fisheries zones the Chamber found such his-
                    toric rights — otherwise characterized as the factual predominance in the
                    area by United States fishermen — to be irrelevant. Ultimately, the

                    the living resources, but also an obligation under Article 61 to determine
                    the allowable catch and to ensure through proper conservation and man-
                    agement measures that the maintenance of the living resources in the EEZ
                    is not endangered by overexploitation. Article 62 also imposes on coastal
                    States the duty to promote the objective of optimum utilization of the
                    living resources in the EEZ, and to determine its capacity to harvest the
                    living resources; where it does not have the capacity to harvest the entire
                    allowable catch, Article 62 obliges the coastal State to give other States
                    access to the surplus of the allowable catch through agreements or other
                    arrangements and, in doing so, to have particular regard to the provisions
                    of Articles 69 and 70. These latter provisions give landlocked and
                    ­geographically disadvantaged States a right to participate on an equita-
                     ble basis in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the
                     living resources of the EEZ of coastal States. These agreements are
                     the only exception to the exclusivity of a coastal State’s sovereign rights
                     for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing its
                     ­living resources in its EEZ. Landlocked and geographically disadvan-
                      taged States have, by way of an agreement with the coastal State, a
                      right to participate on an equitable basis in the exploitation of an
                      appropriate part of the surplus of the allowable catch. There is no
                      ­
                      ­agreement or arrangement between Colombia and Nicaragua for Colom-
                       bia to have access to any surplus of the allowable catch in Nicaragua’s
                       EEZ.

                       are its sovereign rights to exploit, explore, conserve and manage those
                       resources; in particular, the obligation to conserve and manage the living
                       resources in a specific way is as exclusive to the coastal State as are its
                       sovereign rights to exploit and explore those resources. If a coastal State,
                       such as Nicaragua, does not conserve and manage its living resources so
                       that it is in a position to determine the allowable catch, as well as its
                       capacity to harvest its living resources and whether there is a surplus of
                       the allowable catch, its international responsibility may be engaged for
                       that failure. A landlocked or geographically disadvantaged State that is
                       unable “to participate” in “an appropriate part of the surplus”, because

                    there is no surplus on account of the coastal State’s mismanagement,
                    would be entitled to claim reparations for the coastal State’s breach.
                    Interference by another State, such as Colombia, in the conservation and
                    management of the living resources may impact adversely on the capacity
                    of the coastal State to discharge this obligation. Such interference engages
                    the international responsibility of that State as a breach of the Mon-
                    tego Bay Convention. This is all the more reason why the Convention
                    gives a coastal State, such as Nicaragua, exclusive sovereign rights over
                    the conservation and management of its living resources. A State’s per-
                    ception that a coastal State is not discharging its obligation to conserve
                    and manage its living resources, even if it is well founded, does not give it
                    the right to assume the responsibility of discharging those obligations.
                    Such a far-­reaching power would have had to be expressly provided for in
                    the Convention. No State may, consistently with the Convention, arro-
                    gate to itself the responsibility of conserving and managing the living
                    resources in the EEZ of a coastal State on the basis of its view that the
                    coastal State is not discharging its customary and conventional obliga-
                    tions in that regard. There is no warrant for interpreting the Montego Bay
                    Convention as giving such a State that power. That would be a certain
                    basis for confusion and, worse yet, conflict.

                    ereign right to conserve and manage the living resources of its EEZ is
                    provided in Article 73 (1), which reads as follows:

                            “The coastal State may, in the exercise of its sovereign rights to
                          explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the
                          exclusive economic zone, take such measures, including boarding,
                          inspection, arrest and judicial proceedings, as may be necessary to
                          ensure compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by it in
                          conformity with this Convention.”
                       25. This is an extensive and far-­reaching power that has been given to
                    the coastal State in its EEZ. In setting out this power Article 73 of the
                    Montego Bay Convention is merely interpreting Article 56 (1), which
                    attributes to the coastal State exclusive sovereign rights in its EEZ. Arti-
                    cle 73 of the Convention allows the coastal State to adopt any measure in

                    conformity with the provisions of the Convention. Importantly, the Arti-
                    cle sees the adoption of such measures as derived from the sovereign
                    rights of the coastal State; that is the significance of the phrase “in the
                    exercise of its sovereign rights”. It is by virtue of these sovereign rights
                    that the coastal State is given these broad and pervasive enforcement
                    powers in the conservation and management of its fisheries. The intention
                    of the drafters is to ensure that the coastal State is able to respond to the
                    conduct of any State that would adversely affect the enjoyment of its sov-

                    fisheries. If the coastal State has exclusive sovereign rights for the purpose
                    of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing its living and non-­
                    living resources, it is to be expected that it would also have the power to
                    adopt measures within the zone that would enable it to enjoy those rights.
                    The decision of ITLOS in M/V “Virginia G” illustrates very well not only
                    the extent of the coastal State’s sovereign rights in its EEZ, but also the
                    exclusivity of those rights. In M/V “Virginia G”, the Tribunal found that
                    the sovereign rights of a coastal State under Article 56 (1) (a) “encompas[s]
                    all rights necessary for and connected with the exploration, exploitation,
                    conservation and management of the natural resources, including the
                    right to take the necessary enforcement measures” 13. Such enforcement
                    rights would not have been given to the coastal State in its EEZ if other
                    States were also entitled to the same rights in the coastal State’s EEZ.
                    Therefore, the coastal State’s sovereign rights in its EEZ are properly
                    interpreted as exclusive to the coastal State in the sense that no other
                    State may exercise them without its consent.

                        26. It remains now to consider whether the jurisdiction of States over
                    vessels flying their flag is an exception to the exclusive sovereign rights of
                    the coastal State in its EEZ.
                        27. The Judgment refers to the ITLOS Tribunal’s finding in Request
                    for Advisory Opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission
                    that the flag State has “an obligation to ensure compliance by vessels
                    ­flying its flag with the relevant conservation measures concerning the liv-
                     ing resources enacted by the coastal State for its exclusive economic
                     zone” 14.
                        28. However, there is an important distinction between the rights and
                     duties of a flag State in the EEZ of a coastal State and the exclusive sov-
                     ereign rights of a coastal State in that zone. It is only the coastal State
                     that has the right and duty to devise and initiate conservation measures
                     for the protection and preservation of the marine environment in its EEZ,
                     including such measures concerning its living resources. This is clear from

                     exclusive obligation to adopt such measures may be seen as a corollary of
                     its exclusive right to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living
                     resources in its EEZ.

                       29. Under Article 92 of the Montego Bay Convention, ships are sub-
                    ject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the flag State on the high seas. Under
                    Article 94, every State must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control
                    in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.

                    exclusive economic zone in so far as they are not incompatible with this
                    Part”. Thus, while a flag State has exclusive jurisdiction over its ships on
                    the high seas, and may therefore set conservation standards for those
                    ships while they are on the high seas, in the EEZ it is the coastal State
                    that has the exclusive right and duty to set the applicable conservation
                    standards for the zone.
