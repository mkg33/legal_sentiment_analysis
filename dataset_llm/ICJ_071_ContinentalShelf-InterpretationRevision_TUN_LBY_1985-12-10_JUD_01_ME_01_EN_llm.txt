1. [have voted in favour of the operative clauses of the Judgment and I
subscribe to most of its reasoning. However, I am bound to dissent from
the conclusions reached in paragraphs 41, 42 and 43, which refer to what
the Court calls “a jurisdictional objection raised by Libya”.

10. To the Court it “is by no means clear” that Libya, by this statement,
“intended to waive a jurisdictional objection, based on Article 3” (para. 42,
in fine). 1 dissent on this point. This is for me a clear indication that Libya is
not insisting on the argument of lack of jurisdiction raised in the Obser-
vations. As I said before, Libya did not include this jurisdictional objection
in its submissions. Objections of this nature, should normally be raised in a
formal way, and they are not lightly to be presumed.

11. Despite this clear statement of intention to waive the objection, the
Court, however, goes into the question of the relationship between the
procedure contemplated by Article 3 of the Special Agreement and the
possibility of either Party to request an interpretation under Article 60 of
the Statute. The Court finds that Article 3 does not impair, in the circum-
stances of this case, the right of Tunisia, under Article 60 of the Statute, to
seise the Court unilaterally.

12. I am also of a different opinion on this point, and I regret that I do
not share the Court’s findings.

13. My reading of Article 3 of the Special Agreement leads me to the
conclusion that the Parties foresee a special procedure of coming to the
Court, before Article 60 of the Statute could be invoked ; it does not seem
to be the intention of the Parties to waive their rights under the Statute, but
to establish a previous procedure for coming to the Court, before they
decide to ask unilaterally for an interpretation. The purpose of Article 3 is
to oblige the Parties to make an effort to settle between themselves which
are the points of difference, before coming to the Court ; if such an effort
fails, the Parties then could ask unilaterally for an interpretation under
Article 60 of the Statute. Article 3 is not a bar, or a “block” — to use the
Court’s terminology —, to the procedure established in Article 60 of the



Statute, if one of the Parties chooses not to co-operate : it is only a
procedure that the Parties should try to follow, before coming to the Court.
The mechanism set up by the Parties provides for a serious effort to reach
an agreement, before coming to the Court. My reading of the documents
submitted by Libya, attached to its Observations, leads me to the conclu-
sion that Tunisia never concretely submitted to Libya what were the points
that it considered needed some explanation or clarification. To my mind,
because of this position of Tunisia, there has never been a serious effort to
try to settle between the Parties what were the points that needed expla-
nations or clarifications.

14. As to the Tunisian argument based on the overriding character of
Article 103 of the Charter, I would like simply to recall that this article
refers only to a conflict of “obligations”, not of rights. The subject has been
dealt with in detail by the most distinguished commentators on the Char-
ter. It would be an interesting juridical exercise to study whether States
may waive their rights under the Statute in a Special Agreement, but this
theoretical problem is not before the Court, because the Parties have
envisaged in their Special Agreement a procedure which requires, first, that
they should try and reach an agreement to seek “explanations and clari-
fications” before invoking Article 60, a procedure which, to my mind, is
not against any provision of the Statute.

15. For these reasons, I share the Libyan argument presented in its
Observations, and not the Court’s reasoning. I would like to add, returning
to the beginning of this opinion, that this proposition, if formally submit-
ted, will amount to the submission of an “exception d’incompétence”, a
preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the Court. As Libya
said in the Observations : “The Court does not possess jurisdiction to
admit the Tunisian request for interpretation.”

16. As I said before, Libya not only did not formally submit this pre-
liminary objection but specifically waived its right. In these circumstances,
I do not think it is for the Court to go into the analysis of the arguments
related to such objection, when the interested Party has waived its right to
invoke it ; this renunciation is tantamount to a very specific consent, and
as consent is the basis of the jurisdiction of this tribunal, the Court, in such
circumstances, could not but take judicial notice of the waiver.
