Jan Mayen must obviously be taken into consideration in delimiting the
maritime areas concerned. However, it should also be recognized that



Greenland — of the size of a continent — is facing a rather small island,
Jan Mayen. But it was emphasized in the case concerning the Continental
Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Maita) that in principle “there can be no
question of distributive justice” in such delimitation cases (I.C.J. Reports
1985, p. 40, para. 46), although application of the median line (equi-
distance line) approach in the circumstances of the present case might
possibly lead to inequitable results.

As stated in paragraph 90 of this Judgment, it lies within the Court's
measure of discretion in order to arrive at an equitable result to make
proper provisions for establishing a system for equitable access to the fish-
eries resources in the “area of overlapping claims”. In paragraphs 91-92
and on sketch-map 2, the Judgment has outlined the detailed division
between the two countries of the fishery zones in the area, giving the co-
ordinates of the relevant basepoints and baselines concerned. I endorse
these findings.
