   1. I concur in general with the conclusions that the Court has reached
in this case as contained in its operative clause (dispositif). This position
of mine applies both to the issue of jurisdiction and to the issues of
merits.
   2. However, I find some parts of the Judgment are not necessarily the
same as my own view in some important respects. I find this to be the
case, especially in relation to the issue of jus standi of the Respondent,
as contained in Section III of the Judgment on “The Court’s jurisdic-
tion”, and in relation to the issue of the application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (hereinafter
referred to as the “Genocide Convention”) to the Respondent, as
contained in Section IV of the Judgment on “The applicable law . . .”.
More specifically, it is my view that the Court’s pronouncement on
the issue of jus standi of the Respondent in the present case, to which
I agree, should be elaborated a little further to answer to some of the
points raised by the Parties, whereas the Court’s conclusion on the issue
of the application of the Genocide Convention to the Respondent,
to which I also agree, has been reached on grounds which I cannot
share.

   4. As the starting point for my examination of this issue, I wish to
make a few preliminary comments. First, I wish to make the point that
the Judgment of the Court in the 2004 Legality of Use of Force cases (see
Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, pp. 279 et seq.) should
be taken as one important point of reference for our consideration of the
present case, in spite of the fact that it is obviously a different case in the
technical sense. It is the most recent authoritative statement on the legal
position of this Court on a number of points relevant to the present case.
I do not accept as valid the approach advanced by the Applicant to the
effect that the Court in the present case would have to choose between
the two alternatives — (a) to harmonize a “vertical inconsistency”
between the 1996 Judgment on preliminary objections in the present case
and the present Judgment, or (b) to harmonize a “horizontal inconsist-
ency” between the Judgment on preliminary objections in the 2004 Legal-
ity of Use of Force cases and the present Judgment, and that the Court
should choose the first approach. These two, however, are not to be the
alternatives from which to choose one rather than the other. In my view,
the Court should proceed in the present Judgment on the basis that there
is no inconsistency between the 1996 Judgment and the 2004 Judgment.
   5. Second I regard the present phase of the proceedings, not as one
more additional argument on preliminary objections to the “jurisdiction”
— ratione personae — of the Court, but rather as a so far unexplored
phase of the proceedings, in which the Court would have to conduct an
examination into the allegation of some fundamental defect in the appli-
cation of the law of procedure of the Court that might vitiate the basis of
competence of the Court to deal with the present case on the merits. It is
my view that this issue of access to the Court is an issue separate from the
issues of jurisdiction in its specific sense, whether ratione personae, ratione
materiae, or ratione temporis, which are all issues relating to the scope of
the consent given by the parties under the relevant legal instruments (or
the relevant legal act in the case of forum prorogatum) in relation to a
concrete dispute.
   6. Finally, it is my view that for this reason the principle enunciated in
the case concerning the Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction of the ICAO
Council (hereinafter referred to as “ICAO Council” case) is simply irrele-
vant. I certainly endorse the principle enunciated in that Judgment to the
effect that “always” in this dictum means “always” in the sense of “at any
stage of the proceedings in the case” (Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
of the ICAO Council (India v. Pakistan), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972,
p. 52, para. 13). This, however, is stating the obvious and nothing more,
since the Court is ipso jure mandated, both as of right and as of duty, to
ascertain that it has jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings, to the
extent that the point at issue has not been raised earlier in the same pro-
ceedings and decided upon by the Court in a way which would constitute




res judicata. On the other hand, I submit that the issue raised in the “Ini-
tiative to the Court to Reconsider ex officio Jurisdiction over Yugosla-
via” (hereinafter referred to as the “Initiative”) of 4 May 2001 by Serbia
and Montenegro is not an issue of “jurisdiction” of such character in its
specific sense in which the term is used in the ICAO Council case.



  7. In the Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court clarified by its 2004
Judgment on preliminary objections the legal character of the “access to
the Court” in the following words :
      “[t]he question [in those cases] is whether as a matter of law Serbia
      and Montenegro was entitled to seise the Court as a party to the
      Statute at the time when it instituted proceedings” (see Legality of
      Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary
      Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 295, para. 36 ; empha-
      sis in the original),
and that this was a separate question from the issue of jurisdiction in a
specific case.
  The Court came out with the conclusion that
      “at the time of filing of its Application to institute the present pro-
      ceedings before the Court on 29 April 1999, the Applicant in the
      present case . . . was not a Member of the United Nations, and, con-
      sequently, was not, on that basis, a State party to the Statute of the
      International Court of Justice” (see ibid., p. 314, para. 91).





have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in the present case, by invok-
ing the principle of estoppel and/or the principle of acquiescence or
further to rely on the doctrine of forum prorogatum. The basic rationale
for this position would seem to be common in all of these arguments. It
rests on the proposition that the Respondent, by acting as if it did not
contest the jurisdiction of the Court for any other grounds than those
which it had specifically raised as the basis for objection to the jurisdic-
tion of the Court in the preliminary objections phase of the present case,
has to be regarded in law either as having accepted the jurisdiction of the
Court in the present case (the principle of acquiescence), or as having
been barred from raising a new ground which is the subject-matter of the
present démarche of the Respondent (the principle of estoppel), or as
having been deprived of the freedom to act in a different way (the prin-
ciple of good faith). Alternatively the Applicant further argues that the
Respondent has acted in fact in such a way as to be tantamount to con-
senting to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court in the present case (the
doctrine of forum prorogatum).
   10. These arguments, in a word, are based on one common presuppo-

      “it is the view of the Court that a distinction has to be made between
      a question of jurisdiction that relates to the consent of a party and
      the question of the right of a party to appear before the Court under
      the requirements of the Statute, which is not a matter of consent”
and
      “[t]he function of the Court to enquire into the matter and reach its
      own conclusion is thus mandatory upon the Court irrespective of the
      consent of the parties and is in no way incompatible with the prin-
      ciple that the jurisdiction of the Court depends on consent” (see
      Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Pre-
      liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 295, para. 36).

This position of the Court has to be accepted as an authoritative state-
ment of the law in dealing with the present case.

1996 Judgment on preliminary objections in its entirety constitutes res
judicata in the present case and thus prevents the Respondent from rais-
ing the issue of the access to the Court/jurisdiction ratione personae, as
contained in the new “Initiative” of the Respondent, at this stage of the
proceedings. It is my view, however, that an assertion of the principle of
res judicata with such a sweeping and general application cannot be
accepted as a valid construction of the principle of res judicata in inter-
national law.
   14. Article 60 of the Statute is generally regarded to be the provision in
the Statute that gives expression to the principle of res judicata as applied
to the International Court of Justice.
   The statement contained in Article 60 of the Statute has been inter-
preted as the practical embodiment within the Statute of the rule of res
judicata as “a general principle of law recognized by civilized nations”.
Thus, during the discussion in the Advisory Committee of Jurists con-
tracted with the task of drafting the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, it was suggested by one member of the Committee
(Lord Philimore) that

      “the general principles referred to in [the present Article 38] were
      these which were accepted by all nations in foro domestico, such as
      certain principles of procedure, the principle of good faith, and the
      principle of res judicata, etc.” (PCIJ, Advisory Committee of Jurists,
      Procès-Verbaux of the Proceedings of the Committee, 1920, p. 335).
Nevertheless, the jurisprudence of this Court, especially in its Advisory
Opinion in the case concerning the Effect of Awards of Compensation
Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred
to as the “Effects of Awards” case), makes it quite clear that the principle
contained in Article 60 of the Statute cannot be considered as an absolute
rule in relation to an international tribunal. The Court stated in that
Advisory Opinion that
      “[t]his rule . . . cannot . . . be considered as excluding the Tribunal
      from itself revising a judgment in special circumstances when new
      facts of decisive importance have been discovered” (Effects of Awards
      of Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribu-
      nal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 55).

issue is whether the problem of access to the Court, argued by the
Respondent extensively at the present phase of the proceedings on the
basis of its “Initiative” of 2001, is something which has been disposed of
by the Court in its 1996 Judgment dealing with preliminary objections to
the jurisdiction of the Court and should thus be regarded as falling within
the scope of res judicata — “that which has already been judged” — for
the purposes of the present case.
   17. It must be emphasized that in the present case the question of jus
standi of the Respondent/access of the Respondent to the Court was, as
a matter of fact, never an issue before the Court at the time of the 1996
Judgment — neither raised by the Applicant nor by the Respondent. In
the proceedings on preliminary objections, the Respondent raised seven
preliminary objections relating to the jurisdiction of the Court but did
not refer to this issue of access to the Court. On the basis of the argu-
ments of the parties, the 1996 Judgment made no mention of this aspect
of the problem of “jurisdiction” lato sensu, i.e., the problem of the “com-
petence” of the Court to entertain the case. The dispositif of the Judg-
ment was confined to specifically rejecting all six — one out of the seven
having been withdrawn — preliminary objections and on this basis pro-
ceeded to a finding that “on the basis of Article IX of the [Genocide]
Convention, [the Court] has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute”
(Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 623, para. 47 (2)
(a) (dispositif)).

decision on procedural issues, including the issues of jurisdiction. Clearly
the principle should be applicable to both. It is not even the question of
whether the 1996 Judgment as a general proposition constitutes res judi-
cata either. It does certainly constitute res judicata. On all these points, I
endorse the position taken by the Court in the present Judgment.

   21. The sole and crucial question is what is to be regarded as the exact
element of this 1996 Judgment that constitutes res judicata for the pur-
poses of the present Judgment.
   22. It could be said in this context that perhaps it was unfortunate that
in 2001 Serbia and Montenegro brought this very issue before the Court
in the form of an application for revision of the 1996 Judgment (Applica-
tion for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning
Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the

to as the “Revision of the 1996 Judgment” case), rather than in the form
of a request for interpretation of the 1996 Judgment. As the former was
strictly the question of the application of Article 61 of the Statute, the
Court — quite correctly in my view — gave its 2003 Judgment strictly
within the confines of the conditions set out in Article 61. If the issue had
been raised as a new dispute concerning the interpretation of the 1996
Judgment as to whether the Judgment covered the question of access of
the Respondent to the Court, i.e., as a “dispute as to the meaning or
scope of the judgment” under Article 60, the Court could have had the
opportunity in 2003 to address the present issue before the Court.
   23. Be that as it may, it would seem difficult to establish against the
background as reviewed above, that the Court in 1996, while fully aware
of the problem which it had already acknowledged in its Order of 8 April
1993 to exist and chosen to avoid to answer, did go, as a matter of fact,
into an examination of that issue, though without pronouncing upon it
expressis verbis in the Judgment, and came out with the “definitive deter-
mination” on that issue in the form of such dispositif. If that had been the
case, the conclusion would certainly be warranted that this specific aspect
of the problem would certainly be covered automatically by the appli-
cation of the res judicata principle.
   24. Under the actual circumstances of 1996 as revealed through the
examination of the factual background, however, I find it difficult to
accept the argument of the Applicant that the Court did decide, as a mat-
ter of fact, the issue of access to the Court and that therefore the issue
automatically falls within the purview of the 1996 Judgment as constitut-
ing an integral part of res judicata established by the 1996 Judgment and
is thus a priori precluded from the Court’s consideration at this stage.
   25. In fact, all these points are reflected in the conclusions that the
Court has drawn in its 2004 Judgment. In this sense what is stated above
represents nothing more than a reconfirmation of the points enunciated
by the Court in its 2004 Judgment.
   26. Having thus stated my basic position, nevertheless I have to pro-
ceed to point out that there is yet one more element which would require
further consideration by the Court on this question in the specific context
of the present case. And I believe that this element constitutes the critical
factor in distinguishing the present case from the 2004 Judgment on the
Legality of Use of Force cases. The essential element for distinguishing
the present case from the Legality of Use of Force cases in my view lies in
the difference in the time-frame in which the Court has to look at the
same problem of jus standi/access to the Court of Serbia and Montenegro
in the Legality of Use of Force cases and in the present case.
   27. In the Legality of Use of Force cases, the filing of the Application
took place on 29 April 1999, and on that day a request for the indication
of provisional measures of protection was submitted by the Applicant in
that case, Serbia and Montenegro. The Court, by its Order of 2 June




1999, rejected this request on the ground that it had no prima facie juris-
diction to entertain the cases (I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), p. 134, para. 26).
Nothing further came about in the proceedings of the Court on these
cases until well after 2000, when Serbia and Montenegro was admitted to
the United Nations. It was in 2004 that the Court had the opportunity,
for the first time on the occasion of its Judgment on Preliminary Objec-
tions in these cases, to engage in an overall examination of the question
of jurisdiction in relation to these cases, including the issue of the access
of the Applicant to the Court.
   28. Under these circumstances, the Court, for the first time in 2004,
was in a position to engage in an examination of the issue of jus standi of
the Applicant in the context of the issue of the legal status of the then
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (hereinafter referred to as “the FRY”)
from the viewpoint of whether the Applicant (i.e., Serbia and Montene-
gro) satisfied the conditions laid down in Articles 34 and 35 of the Statute
and whether the Court was open to the Applicant. In the Judgment itself
the Court declared for the first time in 2004 that
      “[o]nly if the answer to that question is in the affirmative will the
      Court have to deal with the issues relating to the conditions laid
      down in Articles 36 and 37 of the Statute of the Court” (see Legality
      of Use of Force, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports

tinguishes the 1996 Judgment from the 2004 Judgment, both relating to
the preliminary objections on jurisdiction.
   33. It is true that the 1996 Judgment did not make any express refer-
ence, nor any express “definitive determination” by the Court with regard
to the issue of the legal status of the Respondent vis-à-vis the Statute of
the Court. Nevertheless, it is simply impossible to think that the Court
was unaware of the issue surrounding the legal status of the Respondent
(the issue of jus standi/access to the Court) which had already been iden-
tified and expressly referred to in its Order of 1993. Under such circum-
stances, the conclusion is inescapable that whatever the view of the Court
may have been at the time of this 1996 Judgment on the issue of the legal
status of the FRY during the relevant period between 1993 and 1996, the
Court at the time of its 1996 Judgment at least did not put in question the
capacity of the FRY to have access to the Court under the Statute. Since
the issue of the capacity of a party to have the legal standing to appear
before the Court has to be regarded as a question which logically pre-
cedes the issues relating to jurisdiction stricto sensu — i.e., the issues
relating to jurisdiction ratione personae, ratione materiae and ratione
temporis under the relevant legal instruments that afford the basis for
jurisdiction of the Court in a concrete case — it would be impossible to

parties, as well as the Court itself, until 2000 long after the 1996 Judg-
ment, had been acting in reliance on the conclusion, induced by the
Court itself, that the Respondent did indeed have the capacity to appear
before the Court, and that this fact in itself constitutes an objective legal
situation which can no longer be ignored at this stage by the parties and
by the Court.
   37. In a nutshell, my view on this question is that the Court itself, and
not the Respondent, is precluded now from taking a different position at
this stage which would be diametrically opposed to the one that the
Court itself is deemed in law to have so definitively determined in the
present case. The principle of consistency as an essential prerequisite for
the stability of legal relations should support such an approach.

 III. THE NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION

   38. The Court, in paragraph 179 of the present Judgment, concludes
that
      “[i]t affirms that the Contracting Parties are bound by the obligation
      under the Convention not to commit, through their organs or per-
      sons or groups whose conduct is attributable to them, genocide and
      the other acts enumerated in Article III” (Judgment, para. 179 ;
      emphasis added).
   39. I agree with this finding of the Court in its present general formu-
lation, and on this basis have voted in favour of the items of the dispositif
relating to this point (dispositif, sub-paras. (2) to (5)).
   40. At the same time, however, I wish to register here my position that
while I accept the conclusion of the Court that the Respondent “through
[its] organs or persons or groups whose conduct is attributable to [it]”
(Judgment, para. 179) may not only incur international responsibility for
acts of genocide or the other acts enumerated in Article III committed by
such organs or persons or groups under international law, but also can be
held to account before this Court for such internationally wrongful acts
as falling within the jurisdiction of the Court under Article IX the Geno-
cide Convention, I cannot agree with the legal ground on which the Judg-
ment has arrived at this conclusion, inasmuch as the Judgment is pri-
marily based on its finding on the scope of Article I of the Convention.


  41. In the most crucial part of the Judgment which discusses this point
of direct responsibility of the State for genocide, the Judgment declares as
follows :
       “Under Article I [of the Genocide Convention] the States parties
     are bound to prevent such an act, which it describes as ‘a crime
     under international law’, being committed. The Article does not




      expressis verbis require States to refrain from themselves committing
      genocide. However, in the view of the Court, taking into account the
      established purpose of the Convention, the effect of Article I is to
      prohibit States from themselves committing genocide. Such a prohi-
      bition follows, first, from the fact that the Article categorizes geno-
      cide as ‘a crime under international law’ : by agreeing to such a
      categorization, the States parties must logically be undertaking not
      to commit the act described. Secondly, it follows from the expressly
      stated obligation to prevent the commission of acts of genocide.
      That obligation requires the States parties, inter alia, to employ the
      means at their disposal, in circumstances to be described more spe-
      cifically later in this Judgment, to prevent persons or groups not
      directly under their authority from committing an act of genocide or
      any of the other acts mentioned in Article III. It would be paradoxi-
      cal if States were thus under an obligation to prevent, so far as
      within their power, commission of genocide by persons over whom
      they have a certain influence, but were not forbidden to commit such
      acts through their own organs, or persons over whom they have such
      firm control that their conduct is attributable to the State concerned
      under international law. In short, the obligation to prevent genocide
      necessarily implies the prohibition of the commission of genocide.”
      (Judgment, para. 166 ; emphasis added.)



   42. In my view, there could be no question that under the general law
of State responsibility international responsibility could certainly be
incurred on the part of a State if an individual or an entity, acting as an
organ of that State or in any other matter which makes the act attribut-
able to the State, should be held responsible for this internationally
wrongful act.
   43. I also have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that the
underlying basic principle of the Genocide Convention is that genocide
as defined in the Convention is a heinous “crime under international law”
(Art. I), which the States members of the international community, col-
lectively as community and severally in their individual capacity, are obli-
gated to prevent and punish, and a fortiori to forego its commission by
themselves.
   44. But I do not believe that it follows from this general proposition
that the Convention, as such, therefore should by necessary implication
be deemed to impose upon States parties an obligation under Article I
that the State parties undertake not to commit an act of genocide and to
accept direct international responsibility for such an act and be held to
account under the Convention, despite the fact that the article does not
contain any provision imposing such an obligation upon the States
parties. The issue is not whether such an obligation on the part of States
exists in contemporary international law or not ; the issue is what is the




source of such obligation if it exists, for the purposes of the present
case.
   45. It seems to me absolutely clear from the very title and the whole
structure of the Convention that the object and purpose of the Conven-
tion is to make a solemn compact among the States parties to the Con-
vention to “confirm that genocide [as defined by the Convention] is a
crime under international law” and to “undertake to prevent and to pun-
ish” this international crime (Art. I), primarily focusing, as the concrete
means to carry out this undertaking, on prosecuting individuals who are
the actual culprits of the crime. We find no provisions in the Convention
which prescribe an undertaking on the part of the States parties that they
bind themselves to the obligation not to commit an act of genocide them-
selves and to assume direct responsibility directly for a breach of such
obligation under the Convention. Since the Convention is a solemn com-
pact among sovereign States, I do not believe that one can simply pre-
sume that such an undertaking is implicitly assumed by the States parties
to the Convention when the Convention itself is totally silent on that
point.
   46. As the Permanent Court of International Justice declared in its
famous dictum, it is one of the fundamental principles accepted in the
contemporary international legal order that :
         “International law governs relations between independent States.
      The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their
      own free will as expressed in conventions or by usages generally
      accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to
      regulate the relations between these co-existing independent commu-
      nities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restric-
      tions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed.”
      (“Lotus”, Judgment No. 9, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 10, p. 18 ;
      emphasis added.)
  47. In the same vein, the same Court stated, in the context of a case in
which the question at issue was whether the extent of autonomy granted
by one of the parties under a treaty could be inferred when the treaty in
question was silent, as follows :
      “the exercise of the [autonomous] powers necessitates the existence
      of a legal rule which cannot be inferred from the silence of the instru-
      ment from which the autonomy is derived, or from an interpretation
      designed to extend the autonomy by encroaching upon the operation
      of the sovereign power” (Interpretation of the Statute of the Memel
      Territory, Merits, Judgment, 1932, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 49,
      p. 313 ; emphasis added).
   48. Moreover, even if such a presumption were to be permissible in the
present context, it would certainly be a rebuttable presumption. And it
can indeed be rebutted in light of the legislative history of the Conven-
tion, as I am going to demonstrate in a moment.




   49. Needless to say, in making this point I do not mean to suggest for
a moment that under the current state of international law States are left
free to commit an act of genocide. Nothing could be further from my
own position on this question. The point is simply that the object and
purpose of the Convention is to pursue the question of preventing and
punishing the heinous act of genocide, which the international commu-
nity is unanimous in abhorring and condemning, through an approach of
treating it as an international crime and holding to account the individuals
who are actual culprits of genocide for their criminal responsibility.
   50. It is to be emphasized that this approach is also in line with the
approach adopted by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg,
which formed the crucial background for the Genocide Convention. The
Tribunal famously stated that “crimes against international law are com-
mitted by men, not by abstract entities” (Judgment of the International
Military Tribunal, Trial of Major War Criminals, 1947, Vol. 1, p. 223)
and went on to punish the individuals involved, rather than the State as
such.
   51. Needless to say, there is no question that a State, as a legal entity,
always acts in its name through individuals who are its organs and that
such acts of these individuals constitute in law acts of the State. As a
result, an act of such individuals acting as an organ of the State is to be
identified as an act of the State in whose name they are acting, and could
incur the international responsibility of the State concerned, if the act in
question is something which can be characterized as an internationally
wrongful act. Precisely for this reason, the Convention addresses that
very issue in its Article IV.
   52. But the issue here is a different one. Even granting that in a great
number of cases of genocide, it is the State which is the real culprit
behind the act even when the act in question is perpetrated as an act of
the individual involved acting as an organ of that State, the question to
ask in relation to the Convention is whether the Convention in its actual
structure takes the approach of directly holding the State to account for
the act which is declared to be an international crime under the Conven-
tion. In my view, the question to ascertain is which of the following three
approaches the Convention, in dealing with the act of genocide, is adopt-
ing as the effective means of achieving the object and purpose of the Con-
vention to prevent and punish genocide :

(a) an approach of holding the individual who actually had a hand in
    the act in question to account for a crime of genocide, which
    requires the existence of dolus specialis on the part of the culprit as
    a matter of criminal law ;
(b) an approach of holding the State, in whose name the individual has
    committed the act, to account for an internationally wrongful act,
    under the international law of State responsibility ; or
(c) an approach of holding both the individual and the State to account
    consecutively.




   In any case it is clear that the Convention has rejected yet another pos-
sibility, i.e., (d) an approach to hold the State directly to account for an
international crime of genocide, on the ostensible ground that a State
cannot commit a crime in the penal sense.
   53. On the basis of a natural interpretation of the provisions of the
Convention having regard to the object and purpose of the Convention
as reflected in its structure, and reinforced by its legislative history as
demonstrated by the travaux preparatoires, I am persuaded by the con-
clusion that — setting aside for the moment the legal implication which
came later to be introduced into the picture by an amendment to the
language of Article IX (a point I am going to deal with later in this
opinion) — all the evidence available to us points to the direction
that the Convention in its original scheme followed the approach (a),
i.e., the approach to pursue the goal of preventing and punishing and
thus banishing genocide as an “international crime”, primarily through
prosecuting the individuals who have committed the criminal act with
dolus specialis, whether acting in the capacity as organs of State or other-
wise. The provisions of Article IV clearly testify to this approach. Also
the emphasis on dolus specialis as one essential constituent element of
genocide as a crime specified in Article II also tends to confirm this inter-
pretation.

capacity as an organ of a State, amounts to an internationally wrongful
act in the eyes of international law, the law of State responsibility
attributes this act in question to the State for whom the individual has
acted as its organ, thus incurring international responsibility of the State
for that act. This, however, is a legal situation arising under the rules of
general international law and is separate from the question of the scope
of the obligations under the Convention as represented by the substantive
provisions of the Convention (i.e., Arts. I-VII). In other words, the
approach (b) would certainly be viable, based on the legal link that
could exist under general international law between the rights of the State
that suffers injury through its nationals who are victims of the crime of
genocide to seek remedy for this internationally wrongful act on the one
hand, and the obligations of the State for this internationally wrongful
