I respectfully agree with the first part of the Court’s decision, wherein
the Court dismisses Australia’s objection that no real dispute exists
between itself and Portugal. It is my view that such a real dispute does
exist and I support the Court’s Judgment on this point.

I am also in agreement with the Court’s observations in regard to the
right to self-determination of the people of East Timor, their right to per-
manent sovereignty over their natural resources, and the erga omnes
nature of these rights. The stress laid by the Court on self-determination
as “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”
(Judgment, para. 29) has my complete and unqualified support.

However, I regret that my conclusions in regard to the second part of
the Judgment differ from those of the great majority of my colleagues,
who have held that the Court cannot adjudicate on Portugal’s claim in
the absence of Indonesia. In deference to their opinion and in recognition
of the importance of the issue, I feel obliged to set out in some detail the
reasons for my conclusion that the absence of Indonesia does not prevent
the Court from considering Portugal’s claim.



necessitates a consideration of State obligations implicit in the principle
of self-determination, the very basis of nationhood of the majority of
Member States of the United Nations. It raises also the important juristic
question of the nature of international duties correlative to rights erga
omnes. Are they limited to mere compliance with specific directions and
prohibitions, or are they set in the context of an overarching principle,
transcending specific directions and prohibitions?

The jurisdictional objections raised by Australia require some consid-
eration also of the status and legal consequences of resolutions of the
General Assembly and the Security Council. In addition, there are several
questions relating to judicial propriety which were stressed by Australia
in its submissions.

Linkage between Jurisdiction and the Merits

Since these issues were fully argued by both sides, since they are all of
deep significance, and since the view I take crosses the jurisdictional
threshold into the substance of the case, my judicial duty compels me to
address these questions!. In any event, the view I take of the jurisdic-
tional objection upheld by the Court requires a consideration of all these
matters, quite apart from their relevance to the merits. There is in this
case such a close interlinkage between the preliminary objections and the
merits that the former cannot be considered apart from the latter.

At a meeting convened by the President of the Court on 1 June 1992,
in terms of Article 31 of the Rules of Court, the Parties agreed that ques-
tions raised by Australia regarding jurisdiction and admissibility were
inextricably linked to the merits, and should therefore be heard and
determined along with the merits. There was therefore a full hearing,
both on the preliminary issues and on the merits.

This was in line with the position stated in the Australian Counter-
Memorial that:

“these bars to the Court’s right to hear the claim are, in this case,
inextricably linked with the merits so that it could be difficult to deal
with them separately and to establish that they possess an exclu-
sively preliminary character” (Counter-Memorial, para. 20).

In the result, this case does not present that sharp division between
questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, and questions relating to the

! See Judge Jessup, in South West Africa: “Since it is my finding that the Court has
jurisdiction, . . . I consider it my judicial duty to examine the legal issues in this case . . .”

merits, that is often present in cases before this Court, such as the South
West Africa cases.

and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor”!.
The question of East Timor, still not the subject of the internationally
acceptable solution sought by the Secretary-General, receives continuing
attention in the reports of the Secretary-General. It is also kept by the
General Assembly as an item on its agenda from year to year.

Several resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly
refer to the circumstances in which the Portuguese withdrawal and the
Indonesian occupation occurred. It will suffice to refer at this point to
two Security Council resolutions — resolutions 384 and 389 of 22 Decem-
ber 1975 and 22 April 1976, respectively.

The first of these noted that General Assembly resolution 3485 (XXX)
of 12 December 1975 had requested the Committee of Twenty-Four (the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples) to send a fact-finding mission to East Timor, and expressed
grave concern at the deterioration of the situation in that Territory.

Portugal, claiming that it is still the administering Power of East
Timor, seeks relief in this case against Australia in relation to a Treaty
entered into on 11 December 1989 between Australia and Indonesia. The
Treaty related to the resources lying between the coastal littorals of East
Timor and Australia. This Treaty has been referred to in the proceedings
as the Timor Gap Treaty, from the circumstance that the delimitation of
the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesia stopped short on
either side of that portion of the shelf lying between the south coast of
East Timor and the north coast of Australia. This undelimited part of the



continental shelf is referred to as the Timor Gap (Memorial, Vol. I,
para. 2.01).

It should be added that the jurisdiction of this Court is based upon
Australia’s declaration under Article 36 (2) of the Statute, by which Aus-
tralia has submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court. Indonesia has not
filed a declaration under Article 36 (2).

The Timor Gap Treaty

This Treaty, entered into on 11 December 1989 between Australia and
Indonesia, is alleged by Portugal to infringe the rights of the people of
East Timor. It is titled “Treaty between Australia and the Republic of
Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between the Indonesian
Province of East Timor and northern Australia” (Application, Ann. 2,
text of the Agreement of 11 December 1989). The preamble recites the
desire of the Parties to

“enable the exploration for and exploitation of the petroleum
resources of the continental shelf of the area between the Indonesian
Province of East Timor and northern Australia yet to be the subject
of permanent continental shelf delimitation between the Contracting
States”.

These petroleum reserves have been estimated, according to Portugal, at
between 500 million and 5,000 million barrels!. Whatever their precise
extent, they may safely be assumed to be of considerable value.

Under the Treaty, a joint Australian/Indonesian régime was set up for
exploiting the oil resources on the continental shelf between Australia
and East Timor. The Treaty expressed the desire of the parties that
“exploration for and exploitation of these resources proceed without
delay”, and provided for a sharing of these resources as between the two

! Memorial, Vol. 1, para. 2.02 (citing Australian Yearbook of International Law, 1981-
1983, Vol. 10, p. 135). Some estimates, according to a source cited in the Portuguese
Memorial, arrive at a figure of “up to 7,000 million barrels, as well as a million barrels of
distillates” (Petroleum Gazette, No. 3, 1988, p. 18).



Governments in a Zone of Cooperation between the “Indonesian Prov-
ince of East Timor” and northern Australia, comprising three areas, A, B
and C, on the following basis:

“(a) In Area A, there shall be joint control by the Contracting
States of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum
resources, aimed at achieving optimum commercial utilization
thereof and equal sharing between the two Contracting States
of the benefits of the exploitation of petroleum resources, as
provided for in this Treaty;

(b) In Area B, Australia shall make certain notifications and share
with the Republic of Indonesia Resource Rent Tax collections
arising from petroleum production on the basis of Article 4 of
this Treaty; and

(c) In Area C, the Republic of Indonesia shall make certain noti-
fications and share with Australia Contractors’ Income Tax
collections arising from petroleum production on the basis of
Article 4 of this Treaty.” (Application, Ann. 2, text of the
Agreement of 11 December 1989, Art. 2.)

Article 33 provides that the Treaty shall remain in force for an initial
period of 40 years from the date of its entry into force. Unless the two
Contracting States agree otherwise, it shall continue in force after the ini-
tial 40-year term for successive terms of 20 years, unless by the end of
each term, including the initial term of 40 years, the two States have con-
cluded an agreement on the permanent continental shelf delimitation in
the area covered by the Zone of Cooperation.

The preambular paragraph to the Treaty recites that they are provi-
sional arrangements which “do not jeopardize or hamper the reaching of
final agreement on the delimitation of the continental shelf”.

To give effect to this Treaty, the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone
of Cooperation) Act 1990 (No. 36 of 1990) was passed by the Parliament
of Australia. Article 3 states that the object of the Act is to enable Aus-
tralia to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty. Under Article 8:

“A person must not undertake petroleum operations in Area A
of the Zone of Cooperation except under and in accordance with a
production sharing contract, or with the approval of the Joint
Authority” (Application, Ann. 2),

established under Article 7 of the Treaty.

The internal legislative measures taken by Australia for the implemen-
tation of the Treaty are among the acts which are alleged by Portugal to
infringe the rights of the people of Fast Timor, the powers of Portugal as



administering authority, the relevant Security Council resolutions and
the obligations incumbent on Member States to co-operate in good faith
with the United Nations.

Scheme of Opinion

This opinion will analyse in Part A the third party rule, concentrating
on what has been described as the principle in Monetary Gold Removed
from Rome in 1943, which has been urged by Australia as presenting a
preliminary objection to the Court’s jurisdiction. This principle is the
basis on which Portugal’s action is dismissed by the Court. The purpose
of this analysis is to ascertain whether Australia’s actions, taken by them-
selves, can be viewed as constituting a breach by Australia of its own
duties under international law, quite apart from the duties and actions of
Indonesia. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, an inde-
pendent cause of action would be maintainable against Australia, with-
out any necessity to pass judgment upon the legal duties and conduct of
Indonesia.

Part B will deal with the objection relating to Portugal’s status to insti-
tute these proceedings. Among the matters arising under this head are the
protective structure of the United Nations Charter in relation to non-self-
governing territories, the legal force of the relevant United Nations reso-
lutions, and the question whether Portugal needed prior United Nations
authorization to maintain this Application.

The question of jurisdiction depends on whether a cause of action can
be made out against Australia, based upon Australia’s individual obliga-
tions under international law, and Australia’s individual actions, quite
independently of Indonesia. For this purpose, it will be necessary in this
opinion to examine the rights of East Timor under international law, and
the international obligations of Australia in relation to those rights.

Part C therefore examines the rights of self-determination and perma-
nent sovereignty over natural resources enjoyed by the people of East
Timor. These are the principles on which Portugal’s substantive case
depends. Granted the applicability of these principles to East Timor, the
central question for determination is whether the actions of the Respon-
dent State are in accordance with those principles.

Part D will analyse the international obligations of Australia. It will
scrutinize the juristic nature of the general legal duties lying upon all
States in respect of self-determination, and the particular legal duties
lying upon Australia vis-à-vis East Timor. It will then examine whether,
through its conduct in entering into the Timor Gap Treaty, Australia was
in breach of its international legal duties.

Part E deals with matters relating to judicial propriety, on which a
many-faceted argument was presented by Australia. This opinion does



not deal with Australia’s submission regarding the absence of a jus-
ticiable dispute, as that has been dealt with in the Court’s Judgment.
However, it considers briefly some of Australia’s other contentions —
such as the contentions that the proceedings are a misuse of the processes
of the Court, that they have an illegitimate object, and that they have been
instituted before an inappropriate forum.


1. The Jurisdictional Issue

(1) The contentions of the Parties

In seeking relief against Australia in respect of this Treaty, is Portugal
entering judicial ground not traversable except in the presence of Indo-
nesia? Is this in fact a contest between Portugal and Indonesia under
guise of a contest with another State which is not the true respondent? If
the answers to these questions are in the affirmative, Australia’s submis-
sions must be accepted, and Portugal’s claim must be dismissed.

Australia invokes Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (1.C.J.
Reports 1954, p. 19) as a central authority on which it rests its contention
that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Portugal’s claim. Australia’s
contention is that a determination against Australia necessarily involves
as a prerequisite a determination against Indonesia in regard to the ille-
gality of its occupation of East Timor. Since Indonesia is not before the
Court, it is argued that the principle of Monetary Gold, which decided
that the Court could not adjudicate upon Italian and United Kingdom
claims to a certain quantity of Albanian gold in the absence of Albania,
operates as a jurisdictional barrier to Portugal’s claim.

Portugal, on the other hand, submits that its claim is not against Indo-
nesia, but against Australia, that the wrongdoing it alleges is not against
Indonesia, but against Australia, and that the totality of its case is made
up only of elements drawn from Australia’s own international obliga-
tions, and Australia’s own unilateral actions. It submits that Indonesia
may well be affected by the Judgment, but that it is Australia’s, and not
Indonesia’s, conduct that is the very subject-matter of the case.

(ii) The circumstances before the Court

The question of jurisdiction is not an isolated question of law, but a
mixed question of law and fact.



As observed in a well-known treatise on the Court’s power to deter-
mine its own jurisdiction:

“The power of the International Court to determine its jurisdic-
tion has therefore two aspects: the interpretation of the jurisdic-
tional instruments and the interpretation (and characterization) of
the facts of the dispute itself. In fact, the jurisdiction of the Court
can result only from the interaction of the elements involved in this
process.” !

It becomes necessary, therefore, as a backdrop to the ensuing discussion,
to refer briefly to some of the salient facts.

The circumstances which are either admitted by Australia, or manifest
on the documents, or of sufficient notoriety for the Court to take judicial
notice of them, are as follows:

(a) the people of East Timor have a right to self-determination which
Australia is obliged to recognize (see Part C below);

(b) the people of East Timor have a right to permanent sovereignty over
the natural resources of the Territory, which Australia is obliged to
recognize (for a fuller discussion, see Part C below);

(ec) among these resources are a share of the maritime resources of the
Timor Gap area, i.e., the portion of sea situated between the oppo-
site coasts of East Timor and Australia — a resource they share with
Australia;

(d) those resources continue to belong in law to East Timor, so long as
East Timor remains a non-self-governing territory;

(e) Australia has admitted throughout the case that East Timor still
remains a non-self-governing territory?;

(f) the United Nations still regards East Timor as a non-self-governing
territory;

(g) this area is extremely rich in oil and natural gas potential. Whatever
its extent, it forms in all probability the principal economic asset
of the East Timorese people, awaiting them at such time as they
achieve self-determination ;

! Ibrahim F. I. Shihata, The Power of the International Court to Determine Its Own
Jurisdiction, 1965, p. 299.
2 Australia’s agent stated in the proceedings, on 16 February 1995:

“Australia recognizes that the people of East Timor have the right to self-determi-
nation under Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter. East Timor remains a
non-self-governing territory under Chapter XI. Australia recognized this position
long before Portugal accepted it in 1974. It has repeated this position, both before
and after its recognition of Indonesian sovereignty and it says so now.” (CR 95/14,

p. 13.)

Portugal, the former colonial authority, has left the Territory, but is
still considered by the United Nations to be the administering
authority;

no other power has been recognized by the United Nations as
having authority over the Territory;

on 7 December 1975, Indonesian military forces occupied the Terri-
tory, and Indonesia is now in full control thereof;

Indonesia has not, to this date, been recognized by the United
Nations as having authority over the Territory, and, nearly twenty
years after the Indonesian occupation, the United Nations is
still engaged in a search for an “internationally acceptable solu-
tion to the question of East Timor” (Reply, Vol. II, Ann. 1.8,
para. 1);

Australia has entered into a Treaty with Indonesia, dividing between
Australia and Indonesia the resources of the Timor Gap area;

in that Treaty, Australia expressly recognizes East Timor as “the
Indonesian Province of East Timor”;

confronted with the legitimate need to exploit its own resources, and
needing, for this purpose, a treaty with the opposite coastal State,
Australia did not seek directions or authorization from the United
Nations before entering into this Treaty, despite the facts that East
Timor was still a non-self-governing territory, and that the United
Nations had not recognized the incorporation of the Territory into
Indonesia. No suggestion was made before the Court that any such
direction or authorization was sought;

this Treaty has been entered into for an initial period of 40 years,
with possible renewals for 20 years at a time;

the Treaty makes no provision for any proceeds of exploitation of
the area to be earmarked for the people of East Timor whenever
their status is determined;

the people of East Timor have never at any stage, either directly or
through any duly constituted legal representative, given their con-
sent to the Treaty;

while Australia is entitled to its share of the resources of the Timor
Gap area, no delimitation, in a manner recognized by law, has thus
far taken place between Australia and East Timor. Till such time,
the exact division between Australian and East Timorese resources
must remain unclear. The possibility must therefore exist of some
benefit to Australia from East Timorese resources which, upon
another division according to law, might have been allotted to East
Timor;

Australia has joined in a Treaty under which a non-renewable natu-
ral resource would, to the extent of its exploitation under the Treaty,
be permanently lost to the people of East Timor. Over a period of
40 years, the entire resource could well be lost for ever;

Portugal cannot, in law, obtain any financial benefits for itself from


this action, if successful, and will need to report to the United
Nations and to act under United Nations supervision.

The entirety of the opinion that follows does not travel beyond the cir-
cumstances itemized above.

(iii) Do the circumstances of the case attract any necessity to consider a
third State’s conduct?

It is against this specific background of admitted or manifest circum-
stances that the preliminary objection must be considered as to whether
the “Monetary Gold principle” presents a barrier to the consideration of
Portugal’s claim. It has been strenuously argued that Monetary Gold
does present such a barrier. Having regard to the multiplicity of circum-
stances set out above, which relate to Australia’s obligations and actions
alone, I regret very much that I am unable to agree. In my view, all the
essentials necessary for the Court to adjudicate upon Portugal’s claim
against Australia are present, without the need for any adjudication
against Indonesia.

Australia is party to a treaty which deals, inter alia, with resources
acknowledgedly belonging to the East Timorese people, who are acknow-
ledgedly a non-self-governing people. So long as they continue to be a
non-self-governing people, those resources will continue to belong to
them by incontrovertible principles of the law of nations. At such time as
they achieve self-determination, they may deal with these resources in
such manner as they freely choose. Until such time, the international
legal system protects their rights for them, and must take serious note of
any event by which their rights are disposed of, or otherwise dealt with,
without their consent. Indeed, the deepest significance of the right of a
non-self-governing people to permanent sovereignty over natural
resources lies in the fact that the international community is under an
obligation to protect these assets for them.

The Respondent fully acknowledges that East Timor is still a non-self-
governing territory and so, also, does the United Nations, which is the
appropriate authority on these matters. While the United Nations still
awaits “an internationally acceptable solution” to the question, the Court
must examine whether it accords with the international rule of law that
any Member State of the United Nations should be in a position:

(a) to enter into a treaty with another State, recognizing that the terri-
tory awaiting self-determination has been incorporated into another
State as a province of that State; and

(b) to be party to arrangements in that treaty which deal with the
resources of that territory, without the consent either of the people
of the territory, or of their authorized representative.



That is the dominant issue before the Court. It centres on the actions
of the Respondent and not of the third State.

In the light of the totality of incontrovertible circumstances outlined
earlier in this section, the Court does not need to enter into an enquiry
into the lawfulness of the conduct of that third State or of its presence in
East Timor.

If East Timor is still a non-self-governing territory, every member of
the community of nations, including Australia, is under a duty to recog-
nize its right to self-determination and permanent sovereignty over its
natural resources. If this is so, as is indubitably the case, the Court would
be in possession of all the factual material necessary for the Court to pro-
nounce upon the responsibility of the Respondent State, which is in fact
before it. Nor would it, in the slightest degree, be encroaching upon the
prohibited judicial territory of making a judicial determination in rela-
tion to an absent third party.

(iv) Is the Court under an obligation to reinvestigate matters dealt with in
the United Nations resolutions?

Australia submits that, despite the United Nations resolutions calling
upon the Government of Indonesia to withdraw its military forces from
East Timor, reaffirming the right of the people of East Timor to self-deter-
mination, and rejecting the claim that East Timor has been mcorporated
into Indonesia, the Court would itself have to determine the question of
the legality of Indonesia’s control over East Timor, were it to proceed with
this case. In the absence of such a determination, according to the Aus-
tralian submission, the Court cannot hold that Indonesia could not law-
fully enter into the Treaty and, without such a finding, the Court cannot
hold that Australia has acted wrongfully in entering into the Treaty.

To enter upon such an enquiry would be to enter upon an immense
factual and political investigation. It would call for an examination de
novo of voluminous evidence regarding the circumstances of Indonesia’s
military entry into and subsequent control over East Timor and of the
numerous intricate military, political and diplomatic activities involved in
any such military intervention, followed by continuing occupation. Upon
this evidentiary material, the Court would be required to reach a judicial
determination. Nor is it possible in any event to engage in such an
enquiry in the absence of Indonesia.

Such an argument disregards the fact that the materials essential to
decision are already before the Court. It disregards the practicalities of
the judicial process. It disregards the scheme of the United Nations Char-
ter which distributes appropriate tasks and responsibilities among the
principal organs of the United Nations. By postulating a virtual impos-
sibility as a prerequisite to justice, it denies justice, however legitimate the
claim.



The Court cannot be reduced to inaction in this fashion by throwing
upon it a burden duly discharged by the appropriate United Nations
organs, acting within their proper authority. Such a position seems too
artificial and removed from reality to be the law or the procedure under
which this Court functions.

Of course, this Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United
Nations, can in appropriate circumstances be called upon to consider
whether a particular organ of the United Nations has acted beyond its
authority or in a manner not authorized by law. Such issues have been
brought before this Court in cases such as Questions of Interpretation
and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial
Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom)
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America) (I.C.J. Reports
1992, p. 3 and p. 114, respectively). No suggestion has been made of any
such circumstances in the present case. The only grounds on which the
force of the resolutions has been attacked is that, owing to a supposedly
diminishing support for them upon a counting of votes and, owing to the
lapse of time since their adoption, they have in some way lost their
authority. There is no warrant in United Nations law for either of these
contentions, as more fully discussed later.

In short, the substantive and procedural principles governing this
Court’s jurisdiction cannot operate so restrictively as to prevent it from
reaching a determination in a case such as this, where all the ingredients
necessary to such a decision are before it and where that decision can be
reached without trespassing upon the rule enshrined in the Court’s Stat-
ute that its jurisdiction flows only from consent. That the judgment will
affect the interests of a third party State is not a factor which, according
to the well-established jurisprudence upon this matter, operates as a bar-
rier to jurisdiction. Such effects upon third parties are always part of the
judicial process and are manifesting themselves increasingly as the world
contracts into a more closely interknit community.

These aspects are more fully considered later in this opinion.

The purpose of the foregoing discussion has been to show that the cir-
cumstances of this case render the Monetary Gold principle inapplicable,
in that the claim against the Respondent State does not in any way neces-
sitate the investigation of the conduct of a third party State and, least of
all, a judicial finding against it.

However, in view of the great importance attached to it in the argu-
ment before the Court, and in deference to the Court’s reliance on the
principle, this opinion turns now to a more detailed consideration of the
Monetary Gold case to ascertain whether, even if it were applicable, it
would present any barrier to Portugal’s claim.



2. The Monetary Gold Principle

(1) Subject-matter

One of the matters at issue in Monetary Gold was whether Albanian
gold should be awarded to Italy on the basis of Albanian wrongdoing. It
was clearly impossible for the Court to determine this question in the
absence of Albania, whose property and wrongdoing were the very sub-
ject-matter on which the Italian claim was based.

The present case presents a totally different picture. The obligations
and the conduct of Indonesia are not the very subject-matter of this case.
The obligations and the conduct of Australia are, and Australia is before
the Court.

Independently of an enquiry into the conduct of Indonesia, the preced-
ing section of this opinion has shown that the Court has before it suffi-
cient materials relating to the duties, the responsibilities and the actions
of Australia, to enable it to make a pronouncement thereon. It does not
need to open up vast expanses of enquiry into Indonesia’s conduct, or
military operations or any other items which may have provoked inter-
national concern, to decide this matter. Far less does it need to adjudicate
upon these. The sharp focus upon Australia’s acts and responsibilities
which is necessary for a determination of these issues can only be blurred
by such an undertaking.

(ii) Parties

In Monetary Gold the two States between whose rights the Court was
called upon to adjudicate were Italy and Albania in the first claim, and
the United Kingdom and Albania in regard to the second (see para. (iv)
below). Albania, the State whose property was sought to be appropri-
ated, and whose wrongdoing was alleged, was not before the Court. In
the present case, unlike in Monetary Gold, no claim is made against an
absent third party. The two States between whose rights the Court has to
adjudicate are Portugal and Australia, both of whom are before the
Court.

In Certain Phosphaie Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Prelimi-
nary Objections (I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 240), likewise, the two parties
between whose rights the Court had to adjudicate were Australia and
Nauru, both parties before the Court. In both Nauru and the present
case, other parties are affected, but in neither case is that factor an
obstacle to jurisdiction.

(ii) Rationale

Two of the most often cited pronouncements of principle in Monetary
Gold are the following:



“In the present case, Albania’s legal interests would not only be
affected by a decision, but would form the very subject-matter of the
decision. In such a case, the Statute cannot be regarded, by implica-
tion, as authorizing proceedings to be continued in the absence of
Albania.” (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32.)

“Where, as in the present case, the vital issue to be settled con-
cerns the international responsibility of a third State, the Court can-
not, without the consent of that third State, give a decision on that
issue binding on any State, either the third State, or any of the
parties before it.” (Ibid, p. 33.)

The Court was stressing, quite naturally, that Albania’s interests would
not merely be affected by the decision, but would be the very subject-
matter of the decision, and that “the vital issue” to be settled concerned
the international responsibility of Albania itself. The generality of the
phraseology adopted by the Court has sometimes led to a tendency to
cite these passages as authority for propositions far wider than were war-
ranted by the extremely limited circumstances of the case — namely, that
Albanian property could not be appropriated on the basis of Albanian
wrongdoing in the absence of Albania. In the present case, no claim is
being made against Indonesia, no decision is sought against Indonesia,
and the vital issue is not the international responsibility of Indonesia.

Indonesia’s legal interests may be affected by the decision, but they are
not the very subject-matter of the decision, in the sense that Albanian
gold was the actual subject-matter of Monetary Gold.

The Court’s determinations on matters pertaining to Australia’s obli-
gations and actions may indeed have consequences, not only for Indo-
nesia but for other countries as well, for Australia has, in the course of
its submissions, informed the Court that several countries have dealt
with Indonesia in respect of East Timor (CR 95/10, pp. 20-21). If the
Judgment of the Court raises doubts about the validity of those treaties,
those other countries who have acted upon the validity of the treaty
may well be affected. Yet, it cannot be suggested that they be all joined,
or that, for that reason, the Court is not competent to hear the claim
before it.

The broad dicta in Monetary Gold must not be stretched beyond what
the context of the case allows.

(iv) Italian and United Kingdom claims distinguished

An analysis of the two claims in Monetary Gold brings its underlying
principle into clearer relief.

The first claim in Monetary Gold related to Italy’s contention that the
Albanian gold should be delivered to Italy in partial satisfaction of the
damage caused to Italy by the Albanian law of 13 January 1945, which



had expropriated certain Italian assets. The second related to Italy’s
claim to priority over the claim of the United Kingdom to receive the
gold in partial satisfaction of the Judgment in the Corfu Channel case.

The first claim, based upon an Albanian action alleged by Italy to be
wrongful, could not, quite clearly, be decided in the absence of Albania.
Albanian rights and Albanian wrongdoing were integral to its very sub-
stance. The judgment on this point was unanimous.

The decision on the second claim, though also soundly based on legal
principle, could perhaps be differentiated in the sense that, though the
competing claims here were between Italy and the United Kingdom, the
United Kingdom claim against Albania was already res judicata in terms
of the Judgment of this Court in the Corfu Channel case. Albania’s judg-
ment debt to the United Kingdom, being res judicata, did not need to be
proved afresh, and could not be contested by Albania. However, the fact
that Ttaly too had claims upon the gold raised questions of priority (see
I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 33) which complicated the issue.

It may be noted, in passing, that judgment on the second point was not
unanimous, for Judge Levi Carneiro registered a dissent, holding that the
Court could, and should, have adjudicated upon the second submission
of Italy, independently of the first, on the basis that the only States
directly interested in the question of the priority issue, namely, Italy and
the United Kingdom, were before the Court (ibid., p. 43, para. 7), and
that it could be resolved simply in the light of legal rules (ibid., para. 8).

(v) The third party principle and the judicial duty to decide

The opinion of Judge Carneiro is significant in that it represented a
concerned attempt to conserve the Court’s jurisdiction without violating
the third party rule. This points to an important concern, always before
the Court, that, while the third party rule is important, and must at all
times be respected, there is also another principle within which the Court
functions, namely, the judicial duty to decide the cases brought before it
within its jurisdictional competence.

As in many areas of the law, the dividing line between the operation of
the two competing principles is not always discernible with clarity. There
will in many cases be an area of doubt, in which the case could well fall
within the operation of one principle or the other. In these areas, the
Court is the judge of its own jurisdiction — a position expressly accorded
to it by Article 36 (6) of its Statute.

A distinguished line of precedents, stretching back to the Alabama
Arbitration (1872) and beyond !, has established that: “The fundamental

! For these precedents, see Ibrahim Shihata, op. cit., pp. 12 et seq.



principle of international law governing these aspects is that an interna-
tional tribunal is master of its own jurisdiction.” ! In exercising that juris-
diction, a tribunal will naturally not view the mere presence of a doubt,
however slight, as a reason for declining jurisdiction.

It is by striking a balance between these principles that the Court’s
jurisdiction can be best developed, rather than by focusing attention
upon the third party principle, to the exclusion of the other. While the
consensual principle must always furnish the basis of jurisdiction, “It is a
matter of common sense that too rigid an attraction to that principle will
paralyse any international tribunal.”* The inadequacies of Article 36 as it
exists3, and the need for “a well-defined functional and teleological
approach to questions of jurisdiction” * justify such an approach to the
problem”.

It was thus for very good reason that, in Military and Paramilitary
Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of
America), the Court expressed a note of caution against undue exten-
sions of Monetary Gold, in terms that its circumstances “probably repre-
sent the limit of the power of the Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdic-
tion” (I. C.J. Reports 1984, p. 431, para. 88; see, also, Certain Phosphate
Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992,
p. 260, and Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/
Honduras), Application to Intervene, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1990,
p. 116, para. 56)6.

As this Court observed in Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/
Malta), Application for Permission to Intervene: “it must be open to the
Court, and indeed its duty, to give the fullest decision it may in the cir-
cumstances of each case . . .” (LC.J. Reports 1984, p. 25, para. 40;
emphasis added). This compelling obligation to decide the dispute before
the Court distinguishes the judge, properly seised of jurisdiction, from
many other functionaries, who are not charged by their office with the
obligation to reach a decision on every contentious matter properly
referred to them within the scope of their authority. Literature on the
nature of the judicial function is replete with emphasis on the judicial
duty to decide. The Statute of the Court itself gives expression to this
concept in Article 38, which stipulates that the Court’s “function is to
decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are sub-

5 See, also, the discussion in Section 3 (vii) below.

6 See D. H. N. Johnson (“The Case of the Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in
1943”, International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 1955, Vol. 4, at p. 110) to the effect
that careful consideration should be given “before the already limited jurisdiction of the
Court is limited still further” by unduly wide interpretations of the third party rule.



mitted to it”! (emphasis added). Indeed, that is the function of the
Court, around which all the other provisions of the Statute are built”.

If, therefore, too restrictive an interpretation be given to the Court’s
jurisdiction, in consequence of which the Court does not decide a dispute
properly referred to it within its jurisdiction, there can be a non-perform-
ance of its express statutory obligation.

While it is important, then, that objections based on lack of third party
consent must receive the Court’s most anxious scrutiny, there is to be
weighed against it, in areas of doubt, the other consideration, equally
important, of the Court’s statutory duty to decide a dispute properly
brought before it within its judicial authority. Too strict an application of
the first principle can result in an infringement of the second.

In the international judicial system, an applicant seeking relief from
this Court has, in general, nowhere else to turn if the Court refuses to
hear it, unlike in a domestic jurisdiction where, despite a refusal by one
tribunal, there may well be other tribunals or authorities to whom the
petitioner may resort.

As Fitzmaurice observes:

“Since the national law will normally ensure that there is some
domestic forum competent to hear and determine all cases involving
breaches of that law, or the assertion of rights under it, it follows
that domestic jurisdictional issues are of secondary importance,
because a claimant who fails on jurisdictional grounds in one forum
can start again in the correct one. Thus, as a general rule, there is no
avoiding a determination on the merits if the claimant persists, and
the defendant obtains no ultimate advantage by raising jurisdic-
tional issues. It is far otherwise in the international field where a
jurisdictional objection, if successful, will normally dispose of the
case entirely, and rule out any further proceedings, not only before
the tribunal rendering the jurisdictional decision, but before any

! See Nuclear Tests ( Australia v. France) (I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 271) for a confirma-
tion of this principle, and for the limited circumstances in which the Court may legiti-
mately decline to decide, as where no dispute exists.

2 In The Republic of El Salvador v. The Republic of Nicaragua, the Central American
Court of Justice remarked, in regard to the third party rule, that:

“many questions that might arise among or between Central American Governments
would be excluded from its cognizance and decision if weight be given to the trivial
argument that a third nation . . . possesses interests connected with the matters or
questions in controversy.

To admit that argument would be to render almost negligible the judicial power of
the Court, since the fact of invoking interests connected with a third nation would
detract from the Court’s judicial mission . . .” (American Journal of International
Law, 1917, Vol. 11, p. 699.)



other. In the international field therefore, such issues assume a far
greater, and usually a fundamental importance.”!

It is an important circumstance relating to all jurisdictional questions
that this Court is the international system’s place of ultimate resort for
upholding the principles of international law, when all other instrumen-
talities fail.

(vi) The test of reasonableness

It is sought, in this case, to interpret Monetary Gold as meaning that
the Court has no jurisdiction because it cannot determine the question
before it, without first determining the legality or otherwise of Indo-
nesia’s presence in the Territory. In short, this proposition would mean
that, where a claim by State A against State B cannot be made good
without demonstrating, as a prerequisite, some wrongful conduct on the
part of State C, State B can avoid an enquiry into its own conduct, how-
ever wrongful, by pointing to C’s wrongdoing as a precondition to its
own liability.

A time-honoured test of the soundness of a legal interpretation is
whether it will lead to unreasonable, or indeed absurd, results. That this
proposition could lead to manifestly unreasonable results will be evident
from the following illustrations, in each of which A is the applicant State,
B the respondent, and C the third party State, whose wrongdoing must
be established as a precondition to the claim or the defence. In each illus-
tration, B has subscribed to the Court’s jurisdiction, but not C, for which
reason C is not before the Court:

— After A and B enter into a mutual defence pact, C commits an act of
aggression against A. B does not come to A’s relief. In an action by A
against B, it is necessary, preliminarily, for A to prove C’s act of
aggression”. Since C is not before the Court, A’s claim must be dis-
missed.

— Between A and C, there lies a narrow corridor of B’s territory. C dis-
charges a large quantity of radioactive waste into B, whence it flows
into A. A sues B. B seeks to prove that the matter is beyond its con-
trol, inasmuch as the noxious material has come from C and, once on
its territory, could not be contained. Since it is necessary for B to

1986, Vol. II, p. 438; emphasis in original.

prove this wrongful conduct on the part of C, B’s defence will be shut
out.

— In furtherance of B’s plans to gather military intelligence regarding
A, B persuades a potential ally, C, to overfly A’s territory for unlaw-
ful aerial surveillance. While overflying A’s territory, C’s plane crashes
over a crowded city, causing immense damage and loss of life. A
takes B to Court for damage caused. A is in possession of material
proving B’s instigation of C’s unlawful act. B can have the claim dis-
missed for lack of jurisdiction, on the basis that a precondition to the
claim is proof of C’s unlawful act.

— C makes a raid against A and plunders, inter alia, a historic object
belonging to A. B acquires the object from C. A sues B to recover it
and needs, as a prerequisite, to prove that it was the identical object
taken away in the raid by C. A cannot maintain the action in the
absence of C, for proof of C’s wrongdoing is a prerequisite to A’s
claim. (The example does not take into account any special treaty
provisions relating to the return of cultural or historical treasures.)

— À State corporation owned by A runs an industrial establishment in
the territory of C. C wrongfully confiscates its highly specialized plant
and factory, and invites B, which commands special expertise in the
relevant field, to participate in running it with C as a joint profit-shar-
ing venture. B agrees and participates. A sues B, alleging the illegality
of the whole enterprise. The claim must be rejected because the action
is not maintainable without proof of the wrongful act of C.

Examples could be multiplied.

In each case a third party’s wrongdoing must be established as a pre-
requisite to the claim or defence. In each case the rule excluding it pro-
duces manifest injustice and an unreasonable result. It is difficult to ima-
gine that such a rule can truly represent a “well-established” principle of
international law, built into the Statute of the Court — a principle on the
basis of which the fundamental question of jurisdiction is decided, on
which in turn depend the ultimate rights of parties in matters of great
moment.

The conclusion is compelling that an interpretation of Monetary Gold
to produce such a result clearly extends the decision far beyond its per-
missible limits. Indeed, such an interpretation seems contrary to the prin-
ciple of individual responsibility of each State for its own acts. The mere
allegation of a third party’s wrongdoing as a prerequisite to the proof of
one’s own cannot deflect the course of justice and steer it away from the



principle of a State’s individual responsibility for its individual actions.
(On this, see, further, Section 3 (ii) below.)

(vii) Prior jurisprudence

In Monetary Gold, the Court stated that:

“To adjudicate upon the international responsibility of Albania
without her consent would run counter to a well-established prin-
ciple of international law embodied in the Court's Statute, namely,
that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a State with its
consent.” (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32; emphasis added.)

It is noteworthy that there was no citation of precedent in Monetary
Gold. It was a decision that formulated no new principle, and made no
new advances. The decision made no greater claim than that it was apply-
ing a principle already embodied in the Court’s Statute.

It would be helpful, therefore, to look at some prior cases.

(a) Advisory Opinions

Two well-known prior cases are Status of Eastern Carelia (P.C.1J.,
Series B, No. 5) and Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hun-
gary and Romania, First Phase (I. C.J. Reports 1950, p. 65), both Advi-
sory Opinions, where similarly strong statements were made in similar
language.

In the first case, the Permanent Court found that it was “impossible”
to give an opinion which bears on an actual dispute between Finland and
Russia, as the Russian Government was not before the Court. Using the
same expression later used in Monetary Gold (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32),
that case too described as “well established in international law” the prin-
ciple that no State could, “without its consent, be compelled to submit its
disputes . . . to mediation or to arbitration” (P.C.1.J., Series B, No. 5,
p- 27).

In Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Roma-
nia, as well, the Court referred to the

“well-established principle of international law according to which
no judicial proceedings relating to a legal question pending between
States can take place without their consent” (I. C.J. Reports 1950,
p. 71).

If these cases were a basis on which this Court described the third
party rule as a “well-established” principle in international law, the point
needs to be made that advisory opinions rest upon a different judicial
basis from contentious proceedings. The Court’s decision as to whether



to proceed with a matter is clearly taken on different bases in advisory
proceedings, where the Statute may perhaps give the Court somewhat
more discretion as to whether it will render an opinion (Statute, Art. 65).
Precedents deriving from advisory opinions, where the Court declines to
give an opinion in consequence of third party involvement, are not there-
fore of direct applicability to jurisdictional decisions in contentious pro-
ceedings.

It is significant moreover that in Status of Eastern Carelia, the Court
described it as “very inexpedient that the Court should attempt to deal
with the present question” (P.C.LJ., Series B, No. 5, p. 28; emphasis
added) and again stated “it is certainly expedient that the facts upon
which the opinion of the Court is desired should not be in controversy”
(ibid. ; emphasis added).

The jurisprudence on this matter deriving from advisory opinions can
thus be distinguished !. Whether or not considerations of “expediency”
can be taken into account in advisory opinions, they have no place in
contentious litigation where the Court must reach a decision one way or
the other (see para. (v) above)?.

(b) Contentious cases

As for the jurisprudence deriving from contentious proceedings, the
manner in which the Court handled the Corfu Channel case, just a few
years earlier, is not in line with the general proposition formulated in
Monetary Gold.

In that case, the United Kingdom claimed that the minefield which
caused damage to its shipping was laid by Albania. As an alternative
argument it claimed that the minefield was laid by Yugoslavia, with the
connivance of the Albanian Government. As the Court observed:

“This would imply collusion between the Albanian and the Yugo-
slav Governments, consisting either of a request by the Albanian
Government to the Yugoslav Government for assistance, or of
acquiescence by the Albanian authorities in the laying of the mines.”
(I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 16.)

In so far as concerned this alternative argument, the principal wrong-
doer was Yugoslavia. Yugoslavian wrongdoing was the prerequisite to

! See D. H. N. Johnson:

“The Court’s judgment gives the impression that certain dicta, properly applicable
to the question whether or not the Court should exercise a discretion in favour of
giving an advisory opinion, were applied somewhat too literally to the different cir-
cumstances of a contentious case.” (Op. cit., p. 110.)

2 See, also, Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. (I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 103), and Rights of Minori-
ties in Upper Silesia (Minority Schools) (P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 15, p. 22), for other cases
which held that the jurisdiction of the Court “depends on the will of the Parties”.



the alleged Albanian wrongdoing, very much in the manner of Indo-
nesian wrongdoing being the prerequisite to alleged Australian wrong-
doing, as argued by Australia.

In proof of this collusion the United Kingdom Government placed
evidence before the Court and, in the Court’s own words:

“The Court gave much attention to this evidence and to the docu-
mentary information supplied by the Parties. It supplemented and
checked all this information by sending two experts appointed by it
to Sibenik : Commodore S. A. Forshell and Lieutenant-Commander
S. J. W. Elfferich.” (I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 16.)

“Apart from Kovacic’s evidence, the United Kingdom Govern-
ment endeavoured to prove collusion between Albania and Yugosla-
via by certain presumptions of fact, or circumstantial evidence, such
as the possession, at that time, by Yugoslavia, and by no other
neighbouring State, of GY mines, and by the bond of close political
and military alliance between Albania and Yugoslavia, resulting
from the Treaty of friendship and mutual assistance signed by those
two States on July 9th, 1946.” (Ibid., p. 17; emphasis added.)

The Yugoslav Government was not a party to the proceedings but it author-
ized the Albanian Government to produce certain Yugoslav documents.

Sir Hartley Shawcross for the United Kingdom made the following
statements, among others, implicating Yugoslavia, not merely peripher-
ally, but indeed, in this part of the case, as the principal participant in the
international wrongdoing alleged:

(a) that it was well known that, at the relevant time, there was the
closest association and collaboration between Albania and Yugo-
slavia (I. C.J. Pleadings, Corfu Channel, Vol. III, p. 239);

(b) that members of the Albanian Forces were sent to Yugoslavia for
training (ibid., p. 240);

(c) that Yugoslavia, under a decree contained in the Yugoslav Official
Gazette, was given “a virtual monopolistic position in regard to
coastal traffic between the two countries” (ibid. ) ;

(d) that Yugoslavia conducted practically the whole of Albania’s for-
eign relations and “had naval, military and air-force missions in
Albania guiding the organization of the military arrangements of
that country” (ibid. );

(e) that Yugoslavia had the relevant GY type of German mines, which
were laid in the Corfu Channel (ibid. ) ;

(f) that the suspicion that Yugoslav ships laid these mines is “converted
into certainty” by the evidence of Lieutenant-Commander Kovacic,
formerly of the Yugoslav navy (ibid. )



(g) that the mines were hurriedly loaded onto two Yugoslav ships which
“silently steamed away” during the night to lay them in Albanian
waters (I.C.J. Pleadings, Corfu Channel, Vol. III, p. 243);

(h) that there was a stock of GY mines at Sibenik and the mines loaded
on the vessels came from that stock (ibid. );

(i) that the ships were seen again 4 days later, but the mines were not
upon them (ibid., pp. 243-244); and

{j) that there was evidence that the duty carried out by the ships was to
lay a field of mines in Albanian territorial waters (ibid., p. 244).

The Court did not dismiss these suggestions as beyond its jurisdiction
to investigate, but in fact, by its Order of 17 January 1949 (I.C.J. Reports
1949, p. 151), instructed naval experts nominated by it to carry out inves-
tigations on the spot at Sibenik, Yugoslavia, and in the Corfu Channel
area. For two days, at Sibenik, the experts inspected the actual geo-
graphical layout of the spot where Kovacic testified he had seen the two
Yugoslav minelayers being loaded with mines’.

Clearly this was a very specific allegation of an internationally wrong-
ful act by a third State not before the Court. Indeed, it provoked a strong
response from Albania in the following terms:

“How could the Court decide on the facts of alleged complicity
and on the demand for reparations against ‘the accomplice’ without
having given a decision against ‘the principal offender’ accused arbi-
trarily and without proof by the British Government?” 2

The Court held, in fact, that “the authors of the minelaying remain un-
known” (I. C.J. Reports 1949, p. 17). Had the Court accepted the United
Kingdom’s submissions, it would have been making a clear finding of the
commission of an illegality by Yugoslavia. The fact that such a wrongful
act was alleged against a third party did not deter the Court from con-
sidering the alternative argument placed before it.

The Corfu Channel case was thus a stronger instance of third party
involvement than the present case. It may even be characterized as a case-

! For the arrangements regarding this visit, see /. C.J. Pleadings, Corfu Channel, Vol. V,
pp. 257-274. See, also, for a more detailed study, Il Yung Chung, Legal Problems Involved
in the Corfu Channel Incident, 1959, pp. 146 et seq.

2 1.C.J. Pleadings, Corfu Channel, Vol. II, p. 353, para. 102, Rejoinder, Government of
Albania.

“Comment la Cour pourrait-elle statuer sur les faits de prétendue complicité et sur
la demande de réparations introduite contre ‘le complice’, sans avoir rendu une déci-
sion contre ‘l’auteur principal’ accusé arbitrairement et sans preuve par le Gou-
vernement britannique ?” (Original French.)



which went to the very edge of the principle, or even, conceivably, some-
what beyond it, but it does not support the suggestion in Monetary Gold
of a steady stream of prior authority.

If the proposition be correct that an application should be dismissed
where the illegal act of a third party State lies at the very foundation of
the claim, the Court would have indicated to the United Kingdom that
this alternative claim was unsustainable in the absence of Yugoslavia and
would have dismissed this aspect of the case in limine.

If, far from taking such a course, the Court “gave much attention” to
the evidence, checked the documentary information and sent experts to
investigate it, it was not governing itself by the principle which Australia
argues is fundamental and well established. It even permitted the United
Kingdom Government to attempt to prove collusion with the absent
third State, to the extent not only of possession of the mines, but also of
a military alliance resulting from a treaty of friendship and mutual alli-
ance. The attitude of the Court in Corfu Channel is thus in sharp contrast
to the Court’s decision in the present case.

The Ambatielos case (I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 10) may also be men-
tioned as an instance where the position of third parties not before the
Court was likely to be affected by the decision the Court was invited to
make.

In the merits phase of that case, the Greek Government, in a case
between itself and the United Kingdom, invited the Court to consider
certain articles of treaties between the United Kingdom and Denmark,
the United Kingdom and Sweden and the United Kingdom and Bolivia.
The United Kingdom Government, without objecting to the reference to
those treaties, questioned the correctness of the English translations of
certain of the provisions invoked. The Court was invited to place a con-
struction upon these treaties which would have helped the Government
of Greece in the interpretation it sought to place upon its treaty with the
United Kingdom. No exception seems to have been taken to the refer-
ence to these treaties!.

(vill) Subsequent jurisprudence

A substantial jurisprudence has built up over the years in which,
although the principle in Monetary Gold has been invoked as a bar to

! See, also, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case (I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 93) where a conten-
tion of the United Kingdom was that, upon the coming into force of the Iranian-Danish
Treaty on 6 March 1935, Tran became bound, by the operation of the most-favoured-
nation clause, “to treat British nationals on her territory in accordance with the principles
and practice of international law” (ibid., p. 109).



jurisdiction, the Court has held the principle within its proper confines,
refusing to allow it to be unduly extended. This accords with the Court’s
view, already cited, that Monetary Gold had gone to “the limit of the
power of the Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction” (Military and
Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United
States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, 1.C.J.
Reports 1984, p. 431, para. 88).

Among the cases so decided by the Court are Military and Paramili-
tary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of
America), Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/
Honduras), Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Fron-
tier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali) and Certain Phosphate
Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia).

Principles that have received elaboration in the Court’s developing
jurisprudence on this point are that it did not suffice that a third party
was affected (Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute ( El Salvador/
Honduras), Application to Intervene, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1990,
pp. 115-116, para. 55); that the interests of the third State must be a part
of “the very subject-matter of the decision” (ibid., pp. 121-122, paras. 72
and 73); that the “test is not merely one of sameness of subject-matter
but also of whether, in relation to the same subject-matter, the Court is
making a judicial determination of the responsibility of a non-party
State” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru ( Nauru v. Australia), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 296, Judge Shaha-
buddeen, separate opinion); that joint wrongdoers may be individually
sued (ibid., pp. 258-259); and that the circumstance that a third party
would be affected by the Judgment is not by itself sufficient to bring
Monetary Gold into operation (ibid., pp. 261-262).

Particular reference should be made to Certain Phosphate Lands in
Nauru (I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 240), which is in a sense closest to the
principle involved in the present case. In that case, although the admini-
stration of Nauru was entrusted jointly to three trustee Powers — Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom — and any finding of
breach of trust by Australia would, it was alleged, necessarily mean a
finding against its partners as well, the Court was not deterred from dis-
missing that objection and setting the case down for hearing on the
merits. The Court held that the interests of New Zealand and the United
Kingdom did not constitute the very subject-matter of the judgment to be
rendered on the merits of Nauru’s Application. The Court rejected Aus-
tralia’s contention that there would be a simultaneous determination of
the responsibility of all three States and that, so far as concerns New Zea-
land and the United Kingdom, such a determination would be precluded
by the fundamental reasons underlying Monetary Gold (I.C.J. Reports
1992, p. 261, para. 55). The fact that the Court’s judgment would clearly
affect third parties not before the Court does not thus deter the Court



from adjudicating upon the dispute between the parties who are in fact
before it!.

The undoubtedly necessary and unimpeachable principle enunciated in
Monetary Gold has thus been kept within the ambit of its rationale by a
steadily developing body of jurisprudence of this Court. With the greatest
respect to the Court’s decision in this case, it would appear that it will
step back from that stream of development and, in so doing, both expand
the limited principle of that case and diminish the area of the Court’s
jurisdiction. The Monetary Gold principle, thus applied, would be dis-
charging a function very different to what it did in the case in which it
was formulated.

3. Other Relevant Factors
(1) Third party safeguards

In Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the
Court observed that, in appropriate circumstances, it would decline, as in
Monetary Gold, to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it where the
legal interests of a State not party to the proceedings “ ‘would not only be
affected by a decision, but would form the very subject-matter of the
decision’ (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32)” (I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 431,
para. 88).

Thereafter the Court went on to note the safeguards available to third
parties in the following terms:

! Reference may be made, in this context, to the situation, rather similar to that before
the Court in the instant case, which confronted the Central American Court of Justice in
The Republic of El Salvador v. The Republic of Nicaragua. El Salvador complained that
the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty concluded by Nicaragua with the United States for the con-
struction of an inter-oceanic canal was repugnant to previous Treaties of Washington
between El Salvador and Nicaragua. Nicaragua’s position was that the Bryan-Chamorro
Treaty was with a State not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court and hence that the
Court lacked jurisdiction. The Central American Court of Justice observed :

“What may be called the fundamental argument: that the Court has no jurisdic-
tion over the subject-matter of this suit because it involves interests of a third nation
that is not subject to the authority of the Court, is also unsound in the opinion of the
judges.” (American Journal of International Law, 1917, Vol. 11, p. 698.)

The Court went on to declare that the Government of Nicaragua was under the obligation
to re-establish and maintain the legal status that obtained prior to the Bryan-Chamorro
Treaty (ibid., p. 730), but it refused to go so far as to declare the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty
void, as that would involve the rights of a third party who had not submitted to the juris-
diction of the Court. Thus,

“The Central American Court did not allow the consideration that it might have to
pass upon issues closely concerning a third State without that State’s consent to deter
it from giving a decision between the two States actually parties to the dispute before
the Court.” (Johnson, op. cit., p. 109.)



“Where however claims of a legal nature are made by an Appli-
cant against a Respondent in proceedings before the Court, and
made the subject of submissions, the Court has in principle merely to
decide upon those submissions, with binding force for the parties
only, and no other State, in accordance with Article 59 of the Stat-
ute. As the Court has already indicated . . . other States which con-
sider that they may be affected are free to institute separate proceed-
ings, or to employ the procedure of intervention.” (I.C.J. Reports
1984, p. 431, para. 88.)

Third party protection, which follows also from the general principles
of international law, is entrenched, so far as the Court’s jurisdiction is
concerned, by Article 59 of its Statute.

Indeed, this concern for the protection of third States is carried even
further by Article 62 which ensures that, should a State consider that it
has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in
the case, it may request that it be permitted to intervene.

When the Court’s Statute was designed, it was no doubt clearly fore-
seen that a judgment of the Court could well make an impact on the
rights of third parties. The Statute therefore embodied these carefully
structured safeguards protecting the interests of third party States which
may be affected by a decision — a structure which both protects them
and enables them to intervene. Monetary Gold did no more than give
effect to these statutory provisions. It was scarcely meant to be erected
into an independent principle in its own right, constituting a third and
further protection, travelling even beyond the Statute itself.

It is to be remembered, moreover, that, while in domestic jurisdictions
where the doctrine of stare decisis applies, the other parties in transac-
tions of an identical nature may find themselves bound by a principle of
law laid down in a case to which they are not parties, in international
law, third parties have the further safeguard of the absence of a doctrine
of stare decisis.

(1) The principle of individual State responsibility

Principles of State responsibility, based on the autonomous and indi-
vidual nature of each State, require that where two States are accessory
to a wrongful act, each State must bear international responsibility for its
own internationally wrongful act.

This principle was well formulated by Portugal at the oral hearings:

“the security and the smooth running of the Organization are col-
lective under the Charter, because each member has duties that it
owes to the others and to the Organization itself, inasmuch as it con-
stitutes their corporate union. In other words, it is because the
system is universal that, within it, each member retains individual



responsibility for its acts and a duty to respect the principles com-
mon to all. It follows that none of the members can shelter behind
the fact that a situation has been created by another in order to
avoid itself reacting to that situation in pursuance of the rules of law
enshrined in the common Charter.” (CR 95/5, p. 72.)

In the Seventh Report on State Responsibility by Mr. Roberto Ago,
Special Rapporteur, that distinguished rapporteur treated as axiomatic
the proposition that a breach of international responsibility by a State
would engage that State’s responsibility, irrespective of another State’s
participation in the act. The report observed:

“It need hardly be said that, if the actions constituting participa-
tion by a State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act
by another State constituted a breach of an international obligation
in themselves, they would on that account already engage the inter-
national responsibility of the State which performed those actions,
irrespective of any consequences that might follow from the part
taken in the internationally wrongful act of another State.”!

On these principles, the Respondent State must answer separately for
its own acts.

This separation of responsibility was illustrated also in this Court’s
decision in Nauru, where, although the mandate and trusteeship in ques-
tion were given to the same three Governments “jointly”, the Court per-
mitted the case to proceed against one of the three trustees, despite the
implications this might have had upon the liability of others. The Court
there pointed out that it was not precluded from adjudicating upon the
claims submitted to it:

“provided that the legal interests of the third State which may pos-
sibly be affected do not form the very subject-matter of the decision
that is applied for. Where the Court is so entitled to act, the interests
of the third State which is not a party to the case are protected by’
Article 59 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that, ‘The
decision of the Court has no binding force except between the
parties and in respect of that particular case.” ” (I.C.J. Reports 1992,
p. 261, para. 54.)

It would be even more inappropriate that a State which has not
accepted the Court’s jurisdiction can use the very fact of its non-accept-

! Chap. IV, “Implication of a State in the Internationally Wrongful Act of Another
State”, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1978, Vol. II (Part One), A/CN.4/
307 and Adds.1 and 2, para. 52, footnote 99; Reply, Vol. I, paras. 7.35-7.37; see, also, Ian
Brownlie, State Responsibility (Part T), 1983, p. 190.



ance as a means of preventing States that have accepted jurisdiction from
settling their disputes according to law.

Australia’s submission that its responsibility “could at all events be no
more than consequential, derived from the responsibility of Indonesia”
(CR 95/8, p. 8) does not accord with basic principles of State responsi-
bility, for, to use again the language of the same rapporteur:

“One of the principles most deeply rooted in the doctrine of inter-
national law and most strongly upheld by State practice and judicial
decisions is the principle that any conduct of a State which inter-
national law classifies as a wrongful act entails the responsibility of
that State in international law.”!

Even if the responsibility of Indonesia is the prime source, from which
Australia’s responsibility derives as a consequence, Australia cannot
divert responsibility from itself by pointing to that primary responsibility.

(iii) Rights erga omnes

Australia has very rightly stated that it “does not dispute that the right
to self-determination is an erga omnes principle” (Rejoinder, para. 78).
This position has been many times repeated in the oral submissions. The
concept of rights and obligations erga omnes is further discussed in
Part D.

An erga omnes right is, needless to say, a series of separate rights erga
singulum, including inter alia, a separate right erga singulum against Aus-
tralia, and a separate right erga singulum against Indonesia. These rights
are in no way dependent one upon the other. With the violation by any
State of the obligation so lying upon it, the rights enjoyed erga omnes
become opposable erga singulum to the State so acting.

To suggest that Indonesia is a necessary party to the adjudication of
that breach of obligation by Australia is to hamper the practical opera-
tion of the erga omnes doctrine. It would mean, very much along the lines
of the illustrations in Section 2 (vi) above, that Indonesia could protect
any country that has dealings with it in regard to East Timor from being
impleaded before this Court, by Indonesia itself not consenting to the
Court’s jurisdiction. In the judicial forum, the right erga omnes could to
that extent be substantially deprived of its effectiveness.

Moreover, in any event, Indonesia would be protected against any
suggestion of res judicata against it. The right erga omnes, when asserted
against Australia, becomes a right erga singulum which, in turn, becomes
a res judicata erga singulum against Australia, in the event of the success

para. 30.



of the claim. It would have no adjudicatory quality against Indonesia,
thus preventing the “Monetary Gold principle” from operating to bar the
action against Australia.

(iv) Increasingly multilateral nature of modern international obligations

Reference has already been made to the fact that the multilateral
aspect of obligations is gaining increasing significance in modern interna-
tional law. Any instrumentality charged with administering international
law in this context needs to take account of this aspect so as not to
restrict the development of international law in keeping with this trend.

Foremost among the sources of multilateral obligations is the United
Nations Charter, under which all States alike are vested with rights and
responsibilities which all others must recognize.

In this network of interlocking international relationships, each State
which is impugned by another for failure to abide by its international
obligations must answer for itself, in accordance with the principle of
individual responsibility already outlined. It cannot plead another State’s
responsibility as an excuse for its own failure to discharge its own respon-
sibility. That other State will answer for itself when the appropriate situa-
tion arises and may perhaps be affected by the judgment the Court
renders in the case before it.

If, for example, the Court held with Portugal in this case, this finding
would have repercussions on many other States which may or may not
have acted in accordance with their individual obligations to recognize
the rights of East Timor. This Court cannot concern itself with all those
ramifications of a finding which it delivers in accordance with binding
norms of international law. The Court cannot anticipate them all, in a
world order of criss-crossing multilateral obligations.

As Judge Shahabuddeen observed in his separate opinion in Certain
Phosphate Lands in Nauru:

“It has been correctly pointed out that ‘[a]s interstate relationships
become more complex, it is increasingly unlikely that any particular
dispute will be strictly bilateral in character’ (L. F. Damrosch,
“Multilateral Disputes”, in L. F. Damrosch (ed.), The International
Court of Justice at a Crossroads, 1987, p. 376).” (I.C.J. Reports
1992, p. 298.)

(v) The distinction between a treaty and the unilateral acts from which it
results

It is self-evident that while a treaty is a bilateral or multilateral instru-
ment, it comes into existence through the fusion of two or more unilat-
eral acts, as the case may be. What the Court is invited to consider in this



case is not the unlawfulness of the bilateral Treaty, but the unlawfulness
of the Respondent’s unilateral actions which went into the making of
that Treaty.

It is a clear principle in the domestic law of obligations that the un-
lawfulness of a contract and the unlawfulness of the conduct of the
parties to it are different concepts. A similar principle is to be found in
the law of treaties, where there could, for example, be a valid treaty even
though one party acts unlawfully by its domestic law in entering into it
(Vienna Convention, Art. 46), or when a representative acts in violation
of a specific restriction validly placed upon him by his State (Art. 47).
The treaty is nevertheless binding.

The Court is not called upon to pronounce upon the unlawfulness or
otherwise of the Treaty, or upon the unlawfulness or otherwise of Indo-
nesia’s conduct, but upon the unlawfulness or otherwise of Australia’s
unilateral act in entering into it. What are the legal obligations of a par-
ticular party, what are its acts, to what extent do those acts contravene its
obligations — those are the questions bearing upon the unilateral con-
duct of one party, which the Court is called upon to decide. The invalid-
ity of the Treaty, or of the other party’s conduct, is not the precondition,
as Australia suggests, for the Court’s finding on the unlawfulness of Aus-
tralia’s conduct.

The acts of a contracting State, such as the decision to sign, the deci-
sion to accord de jure recognition, the decision to ratify, the decision to
implement, the decision to legislate, are all unilateral acts upon which the
Court can adjudicate.

(vi) Has the wrong party been sued?

Australia’s position is that the true respondent in this case is Indonesia.
According to this submission, Portugal’s real opponent is Indonesia,
Portugal’s grievance is against Indonesia and Portugal’s true cause of
action is only against Indonesia.

At the oral hearings, Australia summarized its case in this regard in the
following terms:

“— on the one hand, Australia heartily subscribes to the legal
settlement of international disputes which lend themselves to it;
but it also subscribes to the principle of consent to jurisdiction
(at least, until a consensus in favour of the universal, compul-
sory jurisdiction of the Court has been achieved); and it con-
siders that this forum should not be diverted to ends not prop-
erly its own; as a sovereign State, Indonesia has chosen not to
accept the optional clause; that is its business;

— on the other hand, Australia does not mean to be used as a
scapegoat, whose principal function would be to salve the con-
science of Portugal which, being unable to join issue with Indo-
nesia, is attacking a State which, in reality, . . . can do nothing
about the matter and whose alleged responsibility — a com-



plete fabrication for the purposes of the case — could at all
events be no more than consequential, derived from the respon-
sibility of Indonesia”.

If Indonesia had in fact been before this Court, one could see that Por-
tugal would probably have pleaded its case against Indonesia in very dif-
ferent terms from its claim against Australia. A larger segment of factual
material pertinent only to Indonesia may have been placed before this
Court, which is not germane to the case against Australia. It may even be
said that, had both Indonesia and Australia been available as respon-
dents, Portugal’s claim against Indonesia may have been the more impor-
tant of the two.

Another way of approaching the submission that the wrong party has
been sued is perhaps as follows:

If Indonesia had been a party before the Court, Portugal’s case against
Indonesia would either be the identical case, namely, that it too acted un-
lawfully in entering into the identical treaty, or it would be a more sub-
stantial case, involving other items of alleged illegal conduct against
Indonesia. In case of the first alternative, if it were the identical case, the
situation would be directly covered by the Nauru decision where the
claim against absent parties would have been identical, had they been
sued, to the claim actually before the Court. On the clear jurisprudence
of this Court, the Court would have jurisdiction. In case of the second
alternative, the case against Indonesia would be one of a different order,
involving a different range of evidence and a different set of issues. The
case against Australia depends upon Australia’s obligations and their
violation by entering into the Treaty. The case against Indonesia would
relate to the circumstances of Indonesia’s entry into East Timor, the
political and administrative arrangements that have followed, and numer-
ous other details pertinent to alleged unlawful conduct by Indonesia. It
would, in short, be a totally different case. Such a situation would run
directly contrary to the Australian contention that the case brought
against Australia is in reality a case against Indonesia, brought against
the wrong respondent.

All that this Court is concerned with is whether a legally supportable

! Public sitting of 7 February 1995, CR 95/8, p. 8. The French original of the (second)
translated paragraph of these oral submissions is as follows:

“— dautre part, Australie entend ne pas être utilisée comme un bouc émissaire
dont la principale fonction serait d’apaiser la mauvaise conscience du Portugal
qui, faute de pouvoir s’en prendre à l’Indonésie, s’attaque à un Etat qui, vrai-
ment, … n’en peut mais et dont la prétendue responsabilité, forgée de toutes
pièces pour les besoins de la cause, ne pourrait, de toute manière, qu’être
consécutive, dérivée, de celle de l’Indonésie”.



claim has been made against Australia. If this be so, it matters little
whether or not a more important or substantial claim could have been
made against Indonesia had Indonesia consented to the jurisdiction.
The answer therefore to the contention that the wrong party has been
sued is that the Court needs only to go so far as to find that there is a
legally sustainable claim against the party that has in fact been sued.

(vil) Historical background

As a postscript to this discussion, it would not be out of place to look
back upon the deliberations at the League of Nations regarding the par-
ticular clause of the Court’s Statute upon which this entire case has
turned.

In regard to consulting travaux préparatoires regarding certain impor-
tant provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, Judge Jessup
observed:

“In my opinion, it is not necessary — as some utterances of the
two international courts might suggest — to apologize for resorting
to travaux préparatoires as an aid to interpretation. In many
instances the historical record is valuable evidence to be taken into
account in interpreting a treaty.” (South West Africa, Second Phase,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1966, p. 352; dissenting opinion.)

The First Assembly of the League, on 13 December 1920, the day of
adoption of the Statute, was discussing the optional jurisdiction prin-
ciple, embodied in Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court, which, subject to minor variations, became Article 36 (2)
of the Statute of this Court. What were the expectations attending the
adoption of this clause, and how was it expected to work?

Some delegates criticized the principle of consent as a basis of the
Court’s jurisdiction — for example, Mr. Tamayo (Bolivia) observed that
this was unstable and perishable material out of which to build the edifice
of justice !.

Others saw the Statute, and the principle of consent on which jurisdic-
tion was based, as an instrument which, through the experience of their
operation, would enable the new concept of international adjudication,
never in previous history available for universal recourse”, to grow in
usefulness and international service. That background of lofty purpose
always attends the work of this Court.

! Documents concerning the Action Taken by the Council of the League of Nations
under Article 14 of the Covenant and the Adoption by the Assembly of the Statute of the
Permanent Court, p. 248.

2 The Court was seen at the time of its creation as “the greatest instrument which the
world has ever yet been able to contrive for seeing that international justice is carried out”
(Mr. Balfour (British Empire), ibid., p. 247).



Developing further the principle of progressive development, Mr. Bal-
four stated:

“if these things are to be successful they must be allowed to grow. If
they are to achieve all that their framers desire for them, they must
be allowed to pursue that natural development which is the secret of
all permanent success in human affairs . . .”!

The inadequacy of Article 36 was recognized in 1945 as well, when the
Statute for the present Court came under discussion, but no agreement
was possible as to how to rewrite it”.

Three-quarters of a century have passed since the adoption of the pro-
vision under discussion. This period has been rich in the experience out of
which this Court and its predecessor have been fashioning an interpreta-
tion harmonious with the needs which the Statute intended it to serve.
Observing that “the very notion of a more broadly based conception of
the jurisdiction of the Court is gaining ground”? and that “[tjhe prin-
ciple that the jurisdiction of an international tribunal derives from the
consent of the parties has long been subject to a process of refinement”,
Rosenne goes on to observe: “The result is that the application of the
principle is less rigid than may be inferred from the manner in which it is
enunciated.” 3

As shown in Section 2 (viii) above, the jurisprudence of this Court in
relation to absent third parties has indeed been growing along the path of
the gradual and steady development envisaged at the time of the adop-
tion of the principle of consent as a basis of jurisdiction.

A continuous thread that runs through the jurisprudence that has
evolved around the “Monetary Gold principle” is the Court’s concern,
while giving due weight to the interests of third parties, at the same time,
to prevent an extended application of that principle from hampering it in
the legitimate and proper exercise of its jurisdiction. Consistent with this
approach, and for the reasons already discussed, the Court should, in my
respectful view, have proceeded to adjudicate upon this case. I am of the
view, again expressed with the greatest respect for the contrary opinion
of the Court, that the present Judgment represents a break in the course
of steady development that has thus far elucidated and refined the appli-
cation of the “Monetary Gold principle”.

(viii) Conclusion

In the result, the Australian objections based on the contentions that
the Monetary Gold principle stands in the way of the Court’s compe-
tence, that the Court would be required to make an adjudication on the
conduct of Indonesia, and that the wrong party has been sued should all
be rejected. The reasons for these conclusions have been sufficiently set
out. Australia’s obligations under international law and Australia’s
actions such as negotiating, concluding, and initiating performance of the
Treaty, taking internal legislative measures for the application thereof,
and continuing to negotiate with the State party to that Treaty are justi-
ciable on the basis of Australia’s legal position viewed alone and Aus-
tralia’s actions viewed alone.

PART B. THE Jus STAND! OF PORTUGAL

If the Court has jurisdiction to hear this case, as indicated in Part A of
this opinion, the matter cannot proceed further without a consideration
of the important Australian objection that Portugal lacks the necessary
legal status to act on behalf of East Timor.

(i) The respective positions of the Parties

Australia challenges the locus standi of Portugal to bring this action. It
asserts that since Portugal has lost control over the Territory several
years ago, and another Power, namely Indonesia, has during all those
years been in effective control, Portugal lacks the status to act on behalf
of the Territory.

Moreover, with specific reference to its treaty-making powers, Aus-
tralia submits that Portugal totally lacks the capacity to implement any
treaty it may make relating to East Timor. Lacking this capacity, it lacks
the ability to enter into any meaningful treaty regarding the Territory, or
to complain that a treaty has been entered into without reference to it by
another Power which is in effective control.

In support of this position, Australia points to the absence of any Gen-
eral Assembly resolution recognizing the status of Portugal since 1982,
and the absence likewise of any resolution of the Security Council since
1976. Australia consequently argues that, even if resolutions before these
dates validly recognized such a status at one stage, they have since fallen
into desuetude and been overtaken by the force of events. Australia
points, moreover, to the fact that successive votes in the General Assem-
bly in relation to East Timor have revealed a decreasing proportion of
United Nations membership in favour of the resolutions recognizing the
position of Portugal.

Portugal argues, on the other hand, that, although it has physically left
the Territory and no longer controls it, it is nonetheless the administering
Power, charged with all the responsibility flowing from the provisions



of Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter, and has been recognized
as such by a series of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.
It submits further that there has been no revocation at any stage of
Portugal’s authority as administering Power, no limitation placed upon
it, and no recognition of any other Power as having authority over East
Timor.

(1) Structure of United Nations Charter provisions regarding dependent
territories

A discussion of the status of Portugal to maintain this action necessi-
tates a brief overview of the structure of the United Nations Charter pro-
visions framed for the protection of dependent territories.

The Charter was so structured that the interests of territories not able
to speak for themselves in international forums were to be looked after
by a Member of the United Nations entrusted with their welfare, who
would have the necessary authority for this purpose. In other words, its
underlying philosophy in regard to dependent territories was to avoid
leaving them defenceless and voiceless in a world order which had not yet
accorded them an independent status.

This is not to be wondered at when one has regard to the high idealism
which is the essential spirit of the Charter — an idealism which spoke in
terms of a “sacred trust” lying upon the Powers assuming responsibilities
for their administration, an idealism which stipulated that the interests of
their inhabitants were paramount. Translating this idealism into practical
terms, the Charter provided for United Nations supervision of the respon-
sible authorities through a requirement of regular transmission of infor-
mation to the Secretary-General (Art. 73 (e)). They were further required
to ensure the political, economic, social and educational advancement,
just treatment and protection against abuses of the inhabitants thus
placed under their care.

It is against the background of such an overall scheme that the Aus-
tralian submissions in this case need to be tested. The submission under
examination is no less than that an administering Power’s loss of physical
control deprives it of the status and functions of an administering author-
ity, and that the protective and reporting structure, so carefully fashioned
by the United Nations Charter can thus be brushed aside.

This is a proposition to be viewed with great concern. It means that,
whatever the reason for the administering Power’s loss of control, that
loss of control brings in its wake a loss of legal status.

The proposition can be tested by taking an extreme example, at a
purely hypothetical level, of a non-self-governing territory being mili-
tarily overrun by a third Power, anxious to ensure not the “political, eco-
nomic, social and educational advancement” of the people, but anxious
rather to use it as a military or industrial base. Suppose, in this hypo-



thetical example, that this invading Power completely displaces the legal
authority of the duly recognized administering Power. If the administer-
ing Power cannot then speak for the territory that has been overrun and
the people of the territory themselves have no right of audience before an
international forum, that people would be denied access to the interna-
tional community, whether directly, in their own right, or indirectly,
through their administering Power. The deep concern for their welfare,
which is a primary object of Chapter XI of the Charter, and the “sacred
trust” notion which is its highest conceptual expression, would then be
reduced to futility; and the protective structure, so carefully built upon
these concepts, would disintegrate, in the presence of the most untenable
of reasons — the use of force. In that event, the use of force, which is
outlawed by the entire scheme of the United Nations Charter, would
have won its victory, and would indeed have won it over some of the
loftiest concepts enshrined in the Charter. It is difficult to subscribe to a
view that thus encourages and, indeed, rewards the use of force.

This example, offered at a purely hypothetical level, has been aimed at
testing the practical efficacy of a legal proposition that seems to run
counter to the entire scheme of the United Nations Charter. As so often
in the law, the hypothetical example assists in the understanding of the
practical rule.

Grave reservations must be registered regarding any interpretation of
the Charter which leaves open so serious a gap in its scheme of protection
and so undermines the central tenets which are its very foundation.

Three major legal concerns arise from this argument. The first concern,
already referred to, is that it seems to concede that whatever the means
through which that control has been lost, the important factor is the
physical loss of control. This is a dangerous proposition which interna-
tional law cannot endorse.
