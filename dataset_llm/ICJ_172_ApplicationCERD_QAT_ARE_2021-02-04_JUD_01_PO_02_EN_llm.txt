                         The first preliminary objection of the UAE does not, in the circumstances of the
                     present case, have an exclusively preliminary character and should be joined to the
                     merits, pursuant to the provisions of Article 79ter, paragraph 4, of the Rules of
                     Court — In particular, the question of whether or not the measures taken by the
                     UAE against Qatar and Qataris on 5 June 2017 had “the purpose or effect of
                     racial discrimination” within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1, of the CERD,
                     is a delicate and complex one that can only be determined after a detailed
                     examination of the evidence and arguments of the Parties during the merits
                     stage — Secondly, the preconditions referred to in Article 22 of the CERD are in
                     the alternative and are not cumulative — The wording of Article 22 of the CERD
                     does not expressly require a party to exhaust the CERD procedures before that
                     party can unilaterally seise the Court — Both Parties acknowledge that the CERD
                     Committee and the Court have related but fundamentally distinct roles relating to
                     resolving disputes between States parties to the CERD — The Committee’s role is
                     conciliatory and recommendatory, while that of the Court is legal and binding —
                     Accordingly, the second preliminary objection should be rejected as there is nothing
                     incompatible about Qatar pursuing the two procedures in parallel — Thirdly,
                     according to the Court’s well‑established jurisprudence, a claim based upon a valid
                     title of jurisdiction cannot be challenged on grounds of “abuse of process” unless
                     the high threshold of “exceptional circumstances” has been met — The UAE has
                     not met that threshold — Qatar’s Application is therefore admissible and the third
                     preliminary objection of the UAE should be rejected.

                        1. I have not voted with the majority in paragraph 115, as I disagree
                     with the Court’s conclusion in paragraphs 113 and 114 of the Judgment.
                     In my respectful view, the first preliminary objection of the United Arab
                     Emirates (hereinafter the “UAE”) does not, in the circumstances of the
                     present case, have an exclusively preliminary character and should be
                     joined to the merits, pursuant to the provisions of Article 79ter, para-
                     graph 4, of the Rules of Court (as amended on 21 October 2019). That
                     provision requires that: “After hearing the parties, the Court shall decide
                     upon a preliminary question or uphold or reject a preliminary objection.
                     The Court may however declare that, in the circumstances of the case, a
                     question or objection does not possess an exclusively preliminary charac-
                     ter.” (Emphasis added.)

                        2. In my view, the majority should not have rushed to conclude that
                     Qatar’s claims fall outside the scope of the International Convention on
                     the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter “the
                     CERD”) based on the pleadings of the Parties at this early stage of the
                     proceedings, but should have carefully examined the evidence during the
                     merits stage, before reaching a conclusion one way or the other. In par-
                     ticular, the question of whether or not the measures taken by the UAE
                     against Qatar and Qataris on 5 June 2017 had “the purpose or effect of
                     racial discrimination” within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1, of
                     the CERD, is a delicate and complex one that can only be determined
                     after a detailed examination of the evidence and arguments of the Parties
                     during the merits stage. Because of the approach taken by the majority, it
                     is regrettable that the other objections raised by the UAE were also not
                     considered. In this dissenting opinion, I endeavour to show why the first
                     preliminary objection of the UAE does not, in the circumstances of the
                     present case, have an exclusively preliminary character and should
                     instead, be joined to the merits. I also opine on the other preliminary
                     objections raised by the UAE.

                                     III. The Court’s Jurisdiction under Article 22
                                                      of the CERD

                        9. Article 22 of the CERD provides as follows:
                                  “Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to
                               the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not set-
                               tled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this
                               Convention shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute,

                            the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.” (Emphasis added.)
                            

                         10. In light of the written and oral arguments raised by the Parties, a
                      determination of whether or not the Court has jurisdiction ratione mat­
                      eriae to entertain the claims of Qatar pursuant to Article 22 of the CERD
                      depends on the determination of the following factors, namely:
                      (a) What is the subject‑matter of the dispute between Qatar and the
                          UAE?
                      (b) Does the dispute concern the interpretation or application of the
                          CERD within the meaning of Article 22 of that Convention or do
                          Qatar’s claims actually fall outside the scope of the CERD by virtue
                          of the exceptions contemplated in Article 1, paragraphs 2 or 3?
                      (c) If so, did Qatar comply with the procedural requirements stipulated
                          in Article 22 of CERD or alternatively did the Parties agree to another
                          mode of settling their dispute, before seising the Court?
                      (d) Lastly, are the claims of Qatar admissible?
                         I will briefly examine each of these in turn, starting with the first.





6 Ord_1221.indb 106                                                                                                         4/08/22 08:26

                      123 	           application of the cerd (diss. op. sebutinde)

                         12. Taking into account the dispute as formulated in Qatar’s Applica-
                      tion, the object of Qatar’s claims, the jurisdictional basis upon which
                      those claims are based, and the written and oral pleadings of the Parties,
                      the subject‑matter of the dispute is whether the UAE by taking the mea-
                      sures that it did on 5 June 2017 and subsequently, against Qatar and
                      Qataris, violated its obligations under the CERD.

                                       B. Whether the Dispute Falls within the Scope
                                            Ratione Materiae of the CERD
                        13. In order to determine whether or not the dispute in the present case
                      concerns the interpretation or application of the CERD, the Court must
                      determine whether the acts complained of by Qatar (namely, the mea-
                      sures taken by the UAE on 5 June 2017 against Qataris living in the
                      UAE) fall within the scope ratione materiae of Article 1, paragraph 1, of
                      the CERD; or alternatively, whether those acts fall outside the scope of
                      the CERD by virtue of the exceptions stipulated in Article 1 paragraphs 2
                      or 3, as argued by the UAE.
                      

                         14. The Court has stated in Oil Platforms 9 and in Certain Iranian
                      Assets 10 that, in order to determine the Court’s jurisdiction ratione mat­
                      eriae under a jurisdictional clause concerning disputes relating to the inter-
                      pretation or application of a treaty, it is necessary to ascertain whether
                      the acts of which the applicant complains “fall within the provisions” of
                      the treaty containing the clause. At the jurisdictional stage of the proceed-
                      ings, a detailed examination by the Court of the alleged wrongful acts of
                      the respondent or of the plausibility of the applicant’s claims is not war-
                      ranted. The Court’s task, as reflected in Article 79 of the Rules of Court,
                      is to consider the questions of law and fact that are relevant to the objec-
                      tion to its jurisdiction 11.
                         15. In the present case, the Court has already stated in its provisional
                      measures Order of 23 July 2018 that:
                             “27. In the Court’s view, the acts referred to by Qatar, in particular

                           nals, are capable of falling within the scope of CERD ratione materiae.
                           The Court considers that, while the Parties differ on the question
                           whether the expression ‘national . . . origin’ mentioned in Article 1,
                           paragraph 1, of CERD encompasses discrimination based on the
                           ‘present nationality’ of the individual, the Court need not decide at
                           this stage of the proceedings, in view of what is stated above, which
                           of these diverging interpretations of the Convention is the correct one.
                           


                              28. The Court finds that the above‑mentioned elements are suffi-
                           cient at this stage to establish the existence of a dispute between the
                           Parties concerning the interpretation or application of CERD.” 12
                      At this stage, I see no reason for the Court to depart from its earlier posi-
                      tion.
                           C. Alternatively, whether Qatar’s Claims Fall outside the Scope of
                           the CERD by Virtue of the Exceptions Contemplated in Article 1,
                                                   Paragraphs 2 or 3
                        16. Article 1 (1) of the CERD defines “racial discrimination” to mean:

                           “any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race,
                           colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or
                           effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exer-
                           cise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms
                           in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public
                           life” (emphasis added).

                        17. Article 1 (2) of the CERD provides that the Convention:
                           “shall not apply to distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences
                           made by a State Party to this Convention between citizens and
                           non‑citizens”.
                        18. Article 1 (3) of the CERD provides that:
                             “Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as affecting in any
                           way the legal provisions of States Parties concerning nationality,

                      in turn referred the Parties’ dispute to the Conciliation Commission and
                      to date the processes before that Commission are ongoing and have not
                      been concluded. Both Parties claim that they are fully engaged in those
                      processes “in good faith”. Unlike the bilateral negotiations referred to in
                      the earlier part of Article 22 of the CERD, the procedures before the
                      Conciliation Commission are tripartite and conciliatory. In its oral argu-
                      ments, the UAE maintained that Qatar was obligated to first exhaust the
                      processes before the Conciliation Commission before seising the Court.
                      Citing the principles of lis pendens 19 and electa una via 20, the UAE argues
                      that there remains the possibility of the two processes (conciliation and
                      judicial settlement) yielding contradictory outcomes, and that therefore
                      Qatar should have waited “to determine whether or not the Conciliation
                      Commission procedures had resulted in a settlement of the dispute”
                      before pursuing judicial settlement 21.
                         31. The wording of Article 22 of the CERD does not expressly require
                      a party to exhaust the CERD procedures before that party can unilater-
                      ally seise the Court. The wording of that Article cannot be compared, for
                      example, to Article IV of the Pact of Bogotá, which provides that: “Once
                      any pacific procedure had been initiated, whether by agreement between
                      the parties or in fulfillment of the present Treaty or a previous pact, no
                      other procedure may be commenced until that procedure is concluded.”
                      (Emphasis added.)
                         32. Both Parties acknowledge that the CERD Committee and the pro-
                      ceedings before the Court have related but fundamentally distinct roles
                      relating to resolving disputes between States parties to the CERD. The
                      Committee’s role is conciliatory and recommendatory, while that of the
                      Court is legal and binding. Accordingly, there is nothing incompatible
                      about Qatar pursuing the two procedures in parallel.

                        33. Furthermore, the Court stated in its provisional measures Order of
                      23 July 2018, regarding the second precondition of “other procedures
                      expressly provided for in the Convention” as follows:
                              “39. . . . It is recalled that, according to Article 11 of the Conven-
                           tion, ‘[if] a State Party considers that another State Party is not giving

                        36. In conclusion, the first preliminary objection of the UAE does not
                      possess an exclusively preliminary character and should be joined to the
                      merits. The second and third preliminary objections of the UAE should
                      be dismissed and the Court should find that it has jurisdiction and that
                      Qatar’s claims are admissible.
