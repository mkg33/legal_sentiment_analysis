                         Where it is impossible to quantify the damage precisely, international courts and
                      tribunals have applied equity infra legem in determining the amount of
                      compensation — In the present case, the Court adopts this line of reasoning and
                      awards compensation “in the form of a global sum, within the range of possibilities
                      indicated by the evidence and taking into account equitable considerations” — The
                      Court decides this case in accordance with international law and not ex aequo et
                      bono — Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, criminal
                      investigation and prosecution are necessary remedies for violations of human rights
                      protected by Articles 6 (right to life) and 7 (right not to be subjected to torture) —
                      The Court could have given this as an additional reason to reject the DRC’s request
                      for satisfaction in the form of criminal investigation and prosecution.

                        1. I voted in favour of the Court’s decisions in the operative paragraph
                      (Judgment, para. 409) and generally agree with the reasoning set out in
                      the Judgment. The purpose of this opinion is to offer my views on certain
                      aspects of the Judgment, namely its reliance on equitable considerations
                      and its reference to criminal investigation and prosecution.

                                               I. Equitable Considerations

                         2. The present case concerns one of the deadliest and most destructive
                      armed conflicts ever to take place in Africa. In its 2005 Judgment, the

                         3. The Court observes that, when mass violations have occurred in the
                      context of armed conflict, judicial and other bodies have awarded com-
                      pensation on the basis of the evidence at their disposal. They have adopted
                      less rigorous standards of proof for the quantification of damage and
                      have reduced the levels of compensation in order to balance the uncer-
                      tainties stemming from the application of lower standards of proof. In
                      particular, the Court refers to the Final Award on Eritrea’s Damages
                      Claims rendered by the Eritrea-­     Ethiopia Claims Commission (the
                      “EECC”) in 2009 (Judgment, paras. 107 and 123).

                         4. In view of the magnitude and complexity of the armed conflict in the
                      territory of the DRC and given that a large amount of evidence has been
                      destroyed or rendered inaccessible over the years, the Court decides to
                      proceed in the same manner in the present case. It observes that the stan-
                      dard of proof required to establish responsibility is higher than in the
                      reparation phase, which calls for some flexibility (ibid., paras. 108
                      and 124). The Court thus awards compensation “in the form of a global
                      sum, within the range of possibilities indicated by the evidence and taking
                      into account equitable considerations” (ibid., paras. 106, 166, 181, 193,
                      206, 225, 258 and 365). The Court notes that such an approach may be
                      called for “where the evidence leaves no doubt that an internationally
                      wrongful act has caused a substantiated injury, but does not allow a pre-
                      cise evaluation of the extent or scale of such injury” (ibid., para. 106).

                         5. It should be emphasized that, in adopting this approach, the Court
                      does not decide this case ex aequo et bono (Article 38, paragraph 2, of the
                      Statute of the Court), as the Parties have not authorized it to do so. It
                      decides this dispute “in accordance with international law” (Article 38,
                      paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court), determining the global sum on
                      the basis of the legal principles and rules applicable to the assessment of
                      reparations. While the Court, as a court of law, is obligated to quantify
                      the damage based on the evidence before it, it is equally justified in taking
                      into account equitable considerations.
                         6. In Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali), the Chamber
                      of the Court acknowledged that it could not decide the case ex aequo et
                      bono because the parties had not authorized it to do so. Nonetheless, it
                      declared that it would have regard to “equity infra legem”, describing it as
                      “that form of equity which constitutes a method of interpretation of the
                      law in force, and is one of its attributes” 2. Equity infra legem, or equity
                      under the law, refers to the power of courts to select from among possible
                      interpretations of the law the one which achieves the most equitable
                      result. International courts have the inherent power to apply equity infra
                      legem without the specific authorization of the parties.

                         8. In Fisheries Jurisdiction, the Court in turn referred to its Judgment
                      in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, in which it observed that rules of
                      law on the delimitation of adjacent continental shelves were to be applied
                      on a foundation of general precepts of justice and good faith, and stated
                      that “it is not a question of applying equity simply as a matter of abstract
                      justice, but of applying a rule of law which itself requires the application
                      of equitable principles” 4. It further stressed:

                              “Whatever the legal reasoning of a court of justice, its decisions
                            must by definition be just, and therefore in that sense equitable.
                            Never­theless, when mention is made of a court dispensing justice or
                            declaring the law, what is meant is that the decision finds its objective
                            justification in considerations lying not outside but within the rules,
                            and in this field it is precisely a rule of law that calls for the application
                            of equitable principles. There is consequently no question in this case
                            of any decision ex aequo et bono” 5.
                      In Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), the Court further
                      explained the function of equitable principles as follows:

                         9. Similarly, having regard to equitable considerations in determining
                      the amount of compensation, as the Court has done in the present case,
                      is an application of equity infra legem, not a decision ex aequo et bono.
                      This is also attested to by the Court’s Advisory Opinion in Judgments of
                      the Administrative Tribunal of the ILO upon Complaints Made against
                      UNESCO. In that case, the Executive Board of UNESCO alleged that
                      the validity of the judgments of the ILO Administrative Tribunal
                      was ­vitiated by excess of jurisdiction “on the ground that it awarded com-
                      pensation ex aequo et bono” 8. The ILO Tribunal had stated in its judg-
                      ment “[t]hat redress [would] be ensured ex aequo et bono by the granting
                      to the complainant of the sum set forth below” 9. It was unfortunate that
                      the Tribunal used the expression ex aequo et bono because it was in
                      fact applying equity infra legem. The Court explained this point as
                      ­follows:
                               “It does not appear from the context of the judgment that the Tri-
                            bunal thereby intended to depart from principles of law. The apparent
                            intention was to say that, as the precise determination of the actual
                            amount to be awarded could not be based on any specific rule of law,
                            the Tribunal fixed what the Court, in other circumstances, has
                            described as the true measure of compensation and the reasonable
                            figure of such compensation” 10.
                         10. In many cases where it has been impossible to quantify the damage
                      precisely, international tribunals have applied equity infra legem in deter-
                      mining the amount of compensation. They have done so when the treaty
                      establishing the tribunal authorized it to decide in accordance with
                      “equity” or to award “equitable compensation” 11. However, even when
                      they were not explicitly given authority to decide in accordance with

                      “equity”, they have not hesitated to apply equity infra legem in determin-
                      ing the amount of compensation 12.
                        In the Loan Agreement between Italy and Costa Rica arbitration, the
                      Arbitration Agreement provided that the arbitral tribunal should decide
                      the dispute “in accordance with the relevant rules of international law”,
                      pursuant to Article 33 of the Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional
                      Rules for Arbitrating Disputes between Two States, which, in the tribu-
                      nal’s words, “mirrors the well‑known Article 38 of the Statute of the
                      International Court of Justice on the sources of jus gentium” 13. The tribu-
                      nal relied on equity infra legem in determining the global sum of compen-
                      sation in this case, noting that:
                            “[t]he Arbitral Tribunal is called upon . . . to assess the global sum
                            due . . . under the relevant rules of international law, and in particu-
                            lar the equitable principles deriving from the notion of justice, which
                            govern international judicial and arbitral practice, taking account of
                            all the circumstances” 14.
                      It emphasized that it was not deciding ex aequo et bono, stating that:
                            “public international law is traditionally imbued with, or influenced
                            by, equitable principles as modes of applying a rule infra legem, entail-
                            ing the tangible adaptation of a norm to the particular circumstances
                            of the case . . . It is important to avoid any confusion here between
                            the role of equitable considerations within the system of applicable
                            law and a decision ‘ex aequo et bono’, which ‘is something quite dif-
                            ferent’” 15.

                       11. As concerns the EECC, Article 5, paragraph 13, of the 2000 Algiers

                      The Commission shall not have the power to make decisions ex aequo
                      et bono.” 16 In examining the compensation claims, the EECC recognized
                      the difficulties associated with questions of proof, the evidence often being
                      uncertain or ambiguous. Accordingly, it determined “the appropriate
                      compensation for each . . . violation”, which “requir[ed] exercises of judg-
                      ment and approximation”. It “made the best estimates possible on the
                      basis of the available evidence” 17. While not expressly referring to equi-
                      table considerations, it is clear that the EECC took account of them in
                      determining the amount of compensation.

                         12. In Corfu Channel, in fixing the amount of compensation, the Court
                      considered what would be the “true measure of compensation”, “reason-
                      able” figures, and a “fair and accurate” estimate of the damage sus-
                      tained 18. This language indicates that the Court took account of equitable
                      considerations in determining the amount of compensation.

                          13. In more recent compensation judgments, the Court has explicitly
                       referred to equitable considerations. In Diallo, it stated that the “[q]uan-
                       tification of compensation for non-­material injury necessarily rests on
                       equitable considerations” and noted that “[e]quitable considerations have
                       guided” arbitral tribunals and regional human rights courts in “their
                       quantification of compensation for non-­material harm” 19. In particular,

                         16. In the present case, the DRC argues that compensation is not
                      s­ufficient to remedy fully the damage caused, and asks that Uganda
                       be required to give satisfaction in the form of criminal investigation
                       and prosecution of UPDF officers and soldiers. The Court rejects this
                       request, explaining that there is no need to order such a specific measure
                       because Uganda already has an obligation to investigate, prosecute and
                       punish those responsible for grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions,
                       pursuant to Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 85
                       of the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions (Judgment,
                       para. 390).

                         17. In its 2005 Judgment, the Court found that the UPDF had
                      c­om­mitted not only “grave breaches of international humanitarian
                       law” but also “massive human rights violations” on the territory of the

                      DRC 26. The Court found inter alia that Uganda had violated Article 6,
                      paragraph 1 (right to life), and Article 7 (right not to be subjected to tor-
                      ture) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (herein-
                      after the “ICCPR”) 27. In light of this finding, in rejecting the DRC’s
                      request for satisfaction, the Court could have given as an additional rea-
                      son that Uganda already has an obligation to investigate, prosecute and
                      punish those responsible for the violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the
                      ICCPR, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 3, of that instrument, read in
                      conjunction with Articles 6 and 7.

                         18. Article 2, paragraph 3, of the ICCPR sets out the obligation of
                      States parties to provide an effective remedy to the victims of human
                      rights violations. In accordance with this clause, read in conjunction with
                      Articles 6 and 7, criminal investigation and, where appropriate, prosecu-
                      tion are necessary remedies for violations of human rights protected by
                      Articles 6 and 7. This interpretation of the ICCPR corresponds to the
                      interpretation consistently maintained in the jurisprudence of the Human
                      Rights Committee, the body established by the ICCPR to monitor its
                      implementation 28.
