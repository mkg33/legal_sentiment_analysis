  19. At the eastern entrance to the Straits of Singapore there are three
navigational channels, namely North Channel, Middle Channel (which is
 he main shipping channel) and South Channel. Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge lie between Middle Channel
and South Channel. (For the general geography of the area, see sketch-
map No. 1, p. 23, and for the location of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, see sketch-map No. 2, p. 24.)

                  3. GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

  20. The Sultanate of Johor was established following the capture of
Malacca by the Portuguese in 1511. Portugal’s dominance in the 1500s as
a colonial Power in the East Indies began to wane in the 1600s. By the
mid-1600s the Netherlands had wrested control over various regions in
 he area from Portugal. In 1795, France occupied the Netherlands which
prompted the British to establish rule over several Dutch possessions in
 he Malay archipelago. In 1813, the French left the Netherlands. Under
 he terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 (also known as the Conven-




 ion of London) the United Kingdom agreed to return the former Dutch
possessions in the Malay archipelago to the Netherlands.

   21. In 1819, on the initiative of Sir Stamford Raffles (Governor-Gen-
eral of Bengkulu), a British “factory” (a term used for trading stations
established by the British in India and south-east Asia) was established
on Singapore island (which belonged to Johor) by the East India Com-
pany, which acted as an agent of the British Government in various Brit-
 sh possessions from the second half of the seventeenth century to the
second half of the nineteenth century. Two treaties were entered into
establishing this “factory”, one dated 30 January 1819 between the East
India Company and the Temenggong of Johor and the other dated
6 February 1819 between Sir Stamford Raffles and Sultan Hussein of
Johor and the Temenggong 1 of Johor. These two Treaties further exac-
erbated the tension between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
arising out of their competing colonial ambitions in the region. This situ-
ation led to negotiations beginning in 1820 which culminated in the sign-
 ng, on 17 March 1824, of a treaty between the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands (entitled “Treaty between His Britannic Majesty and the
King of the Netherlands, Respecting Territory and Commerce in the East
Indies” and hereinafter referred to as “the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty”).
Under the terms of this Treaty, the Dutch withdrew their opposition to
 he occupation of Singapore by the United Kingdom and the latter
agreed not to establish any trading post on any islands south of the
Straits of Singapore. The Treaty had the practical effect of broadly estab-
 ishing the spheres of influence of the two colonial Powers in the East
Indies. As a consequence, one part of the Sultanate of Johor fell within a
British sphere of influence while the other fell within a Dutch sphere of
 nfluence.
   22. On 2 August 1824 a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed
between the East India Company and the Sultan of Johor and Temeng-
gong of Johor (hereinafter “the Crawfurd Treaty”, named after the Brit-
 sh Resident of Singapore), providing for the full cession of Singapore to
 he East India Company, along with all islands within 10 geographical
miles of Singapore (see paragraph 102 below).

   23. Since the death of Sultan Mahmud III in 1812, his two sons, Hus-
sein and Abdul Rahman had held competing claims to succession to the
Johor Sultanate. The United Kingdom had recognized as the heir the
elder son Hussein (who was based in Singapore), whereas the Nether-
 ands had recognized as the heir the younger son Abdul Rahman (who

 1 A “Temenggong” was a high-ranking official in traditional Malay states. In Johor, in

he first half of the nineteenth century, as a result of the internal rivalry between the Sul-
an and the Temenggong, third states wishing to enter into important transactions tended
o seek the consent of both. In 1855, full authority in Johor was transferred by the Sultan
o the Temenggong.


was based in Riau, present day Pulau Bintan in Indonesia). Following
 he signing of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, Sultan Abdul Rahman sent
a letter dated 25 June 1825 to his brother, in which, “in complete agree-
ment with the spirit and the content of the treaty concluded between their
Majesties, the Kings of the Netherlands and Great Britain” whereby “the
division of the lands of Johor, Pahang, Riau and Lingga [was] stipu-
 ated”, he donated to Sultan Hussein “[t]he part of the lands assigned to
 the latter]”. Sultan Abdul Rahman wrote to his brother that :
        “Your territory, thus, extends over Johor and Pahang on the
     mainland or on the Malay Peninsula. The territory of Your Brother
     [Abdul Rahman] extends out over the islands of Lingga, Bintan,
     Galang, Bulan, Karimon and all other islands. Whatsoever may be
     in the sea, this is the territory of Your Brother, and whatever is situ-
     ated on the mainland is yours.”
   24. In 1826 the East India Company established the Straits Settle-
ments, a grouping of the company’s territories consisting, inter alia, of
Penang, Singapore and Malacca.
   25. Between March 1850 and October 1851 a lighthouse was con-
structed on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. The circumstances of its
construction will be considered later in this Judgment.
   26. In 1867 the Straits Settlements became a British crown colony,
making the Settlements answerable directly to the Colonial Office in Lon-
don. In 1885 the British Government and the State of Johor concluded
 he Johor Treaty which gave the United Kingdom overland trade and
 ransit rights through the State of Johor and responsibility for its foreign
relations, as well as providing for British protection of its territorial
 ntegrity. In 1895 the British Government established the Federated
Malay States, a federation of four protectorates (Selangor, Perak, Negeri
Sembilan and Pahang) on the Malay peninsula. Johor formed part of the
“Unfederated Malay States”, an expression used not to denote a single
entity but rather to describe those States which were not comprised
within the Federated Malay States or the Straits Settlements.


   27. In 1914, British influence in Johor was formalized and increased
 hrough the appointment of a British Adviser.
   28. On 19 October 1927 the Governor of the Straits Settlements and
 he Sultan of Johor signed the “Straits Settlement and Johor Territorial
Waters Agreement” (hereinafter “the 1927 Agreement”). This Agreement
provided for the retrocession of certain “seas, straits and islets” that had
originally been ceded by Johor to the East India Company under the
Crawfurd Treaty.
   29. The Straits Settlements were dissolved in 1946 ; that same year the
Malayan Union was created, comprising part of the former Straits Set-
 lements (excluding Singapore), the Federated Malay States and five
Unfederated Malay States (including Johor). From 1946, Singapore was


administered as a British Crown Colony in its own right. In 1948 the
Malayan Union became the Federation of Malaya, a grouping of British
colonies and Malay States under the protection of the British. The Fed-
eration of Malaya gained independence from Britain in 1957, with Johor
as a constituent state of the Federation. In 1958 Singapore became a self-
governing colony. In 1963 the Federation of Malaysia was established,
 ormed by the merger of the Federation of Malaya with the former Brit-
 sh colonies of Singapore, Sabah (then North Borneo) and Sarawak. In
1965 Singapore left the Federation and became a sovereign and inde-
pendent State.

                       4. HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE
   30. On 21 December 1979 Malaysia published a map entitled “Terri-
 orial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia” (published
by the Director of National Mapping, Malaysia) (hereinafter “the
1979 map”), which showed the outer limits and co-ordinates of the ter-
ritorial sea and continental shelf claimed by Malaysia. The map depicted
 he island of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as lying within Malaysia’s
 erritorial waters. By a diplomatic Note dated 14 February 1980 Singa-
pore rejected Malaysia’s “claim” to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh and
requested that the 1979 map be corrected.

   31. Singapore’s Note of 14 February 1980 led to an exchange of corre-
spondence and subsequently to a series of intergovernmental talks in
1993-1994 which did not bring a resolution of the matter. During the first
round of talks in February 1993 the question of the appurtenance of
Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. In view of the lack of
progress in the bilateral negotiations, the Parties agreed to submit the dis-
pute for resolution by the International Court of Justice. The Special
Agreement was signed in February 2003, and notified to the Court
 n July 2003 (see paragraph 1 above).

                                      *
   32. The Court recalls that, in the context of a dispute related to sov-
ereignty over land such as the present one, the date upon which the dis-
pute crystallized is of significance. Its significance lies in distinguishing
between those acts which should be taken into consideration for the pur-
pose of establishing or ascertaining sovereignty and those acts occurring
after such date,
     “which are in general meaningless for that purpose, having been car-
     ried out by a State which, already having claims to assert in a legal
     dispute, could have taken those actions strictly with the aim of but-
     tressing those claims” (Territorial and Maritime Dispute between
     Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Hon-
     duras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, pp. 697-698, para. 117).


As the Court explained in the Indonesia/Malaysia case,
        “it cannot take into consideration acts having taken place after
     the date on which the dispute between the Parties crystallized unless
     such acts are a normal continuation of prior acts and are not under-
     taken for the purpose of improving the legal position of the Party
     which relies on them” (Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau
     Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002,
     p. 682, para. 135).

                                    *
   33. The Parties are agreed that, with regard to Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh, the dispute crystallized in 1980, when Singapore and Malay-
sia formally opposed each other’s claims to the island. According to
Malaysia, “[t]he Protest Note of 14 February 1980 crystallized the dis-
pute. On this basis the critical date for the dispute over Pulau Batu Puteh
 s 14 February 1980.” For its part, Singapore claims that “it was only in
1979 that Malaysia made a formal claim to the island through the pub-
 ication of its map”, which Singapore protested against through its dip-
 omatic Note of 14 February 1980. Singapore thus refers to “the 1979-
1980 critical date”.
   34. In the view of the Court, it was on 14 February 1980, the time of
Singapore’s protest in response to Malaysia’s publication of the 1979 map,
 hat the dispute as to sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
crystallized.
   35. With regard to Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court notes
 hat the Parties disagree as to the date when the dispute crystallized.
According to Malaysia, it was on 6 February 1993, when Singapore alleg-
edly “for the first time during the first round of bilateral discussions
between the Parties . . . included Middle Rocks and South Ledge in addi-
 ion to its claim to Pulau Batu Puteh”. Singapore does not deny that it
asserted a claim to Middle Rocks and South Ledge on 6 February 1993
but explains that this “claim” was made in “response to Malaysia’s state-
ment made a day earlier describing Middle Rocks and South Ledge as
 wo Malaysian islands” (emphasis in the original). Singapore stresses that
 ts long held position is that Middle Rocks and South Ledge cannot be
considered as distinct from Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh and thus “[i]t
 ollows that the critical date for all three features must naturally be the
same”.

   36. The Court observes that Singapore’s Note of 14 February 1980
refers explicitly only to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. Moreover, Sing-
apore has not provided any contemporaneous evidence that it intended
 o include Middle Rocks and South Ledge within the scope of this Note.
In the circumstances, the Court concludes that the dispute as to sover-
eignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge crystallized on 6 February
1993.


       5. SOVEREIGNTY OVER PEDRA BRANCA/PULAU BATU PUTEH

                      5.1. Arguments of the Parties
  37. Malaysia states its position on the question of title to Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh in its Memorial as follows :
       “Malaysia has an original title to Pulau Batu Puteh of long stand-
     ing. Pulau Batu Puteh is, and has always been, part of the Malaysian
     State of Johor. Nothing has happened to displace Malaysia’s sov-
     ereignty over it. Singapore’s presence on the island for the sole pur-
     pose of constructing and maintaining a lighthouse there — with the
     permission of the territorial sovereign — is insufficient to vest sov-
     ereignty in it.”
  38. According to Malaysia,
       “PBP could not at any relevant time be considered as terra nullius
     and hence susceptible to acquisition through occupation. There is
     nothing to demonstrate that Johor had lost its title since there is no
     evidence that at any time it had the intention of ceding, let alone
     abandoning its sovereignty over the island.”
  39. In its Memorial Singapore formulates its case on the question of
itle to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh in the following terms :

     “Singapore’s case is that the events of 1847 to 1851 . . . constituted a
     taking of lawful possession of Pedra Branca by agents of the British
     Crown. In the years that followed, the British Crown, and subse-
     quently, Singapore continually exercised acts of State authority in
     respect of Pedra Branca. This effective and peaceful exercise of State
     authority confirmed and maintained the title gained in the period
     1847 to 1851 by the taking of lawful possession on behalf of the
     Crown.”
  Singapore sums up its position as follows :
       “The basis of Singapore’s title to Pedra Branca can be analysed as
     follows :
     (a) The selection of Pedra Branca as the site for building of the
          lighthouse with the authorization of the British Crown consti-
          tuted a classic taking of possession à titre de souverain.
     (b) Title was acquired by the British Crown in accordance with the
          legal principles governing acquisition of territory in 1847-1851.

     (c) The title acquired in 1847-1851 has been maintained by the
         British Crown and its lawful successor, the Republic of Singa-
         pore.”
  40. It is to be noted that, initially, in Singapore’s Memorial and Coun-


 er-Memorial, no reference is made expressly to the status of Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as terra nullius. In its Reply Singapore expressly
 ndicated that “[i]t is obvious that the status of Pedra Branca in 1847 was
 hat of terra nullius”. At the stage of the oral pleadings Singapore also
referred to the legal status of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as terra nul-
 ius. In his statement, the Agent of Singapore contended as follows :

        “Singapore’s title to Pedra Branca is based upon the taking of
     lawful possession of the island by the British authorities in Singa-
     pore during the period 1847 to 1851. Malaysia claims that, prior to
     1847, Pedra Branca was under the sovereignty of Johor. However,
     there is absolutely no evidence to support Malaysia’s claim.
     Mr. President, the truth is that, prior to 1847, Pedra Branca was
     terra nullius, and had never been the subject of a prior claim, or any
     manifestation of sovereignty by any sovereign entity.”

   41. In its oral pleadings Singapore advanced, as an alternative to its
claim that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was terra nullius, the argu-
ment that the legal status of the island was indeterminate at the time of
 he United Kingdom’s taking possession of it. It did not pursue this
 urther.
   42. However put, Singapore’s contentions, including its alternative
argument mentioned above, are premised on its view that Malaysia’s
claim of title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, based on its alleged
ancient original title to the island since the days of the Sultanate of
Johor, cannot stand. The Court notes therefore that the issue is reduced
 o whether Malaysia can establish its original title dating back to the
period before Singapore’s activities of 1847 to 1851, and conversely
whether Singapore can establish its claim that it took “lawful possession
of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh” at some stage from the middle of the
nineteenth century when the construction of the lighthouse by agents of
 he British Crown started.




                5.2. The question of the burden of proof
  43. On the question of the burden of proof, Singapore states :
       “The burden remains at all times on Malaysia to produce specific
     proof that old Johor had sovereignty over Pedra Branca and carried
     out acts of a sovereign nature on or over the island. Malaysia has
     produced no evidence whatever in this regard.”
Further, citing the Judgment of this Court in the Temple of Preah Vihear
case, Singapore argues as follows :


        “Malaysia appears to forget that ‘the burden of proof in respect of
     [the facts and contentions on which the respective claims of the
     Parties are based] will of course lie on the Party asserting or putting
     them forward’ (Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand),
     Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 16) ; it is thus for Malay-
     sia to show that Johor could demonstrate some title to Pedra Branca,
     yet it has done no such thing.”
  44. Malaysia agrees that the burden of proof lies with the Party assert-
 ng a fact. It therefore contends that Singapore must establish that the
 aking of possession of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was possible
because Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was terra nullius at the relevant
 ime. Malaysia further asserts that Singapore’s “terra nullius claim” rests
on inference and that Singapore remained silent or failed to produce the
“inconvertible legal evidence” in support of its claim.

   45. It is a general principle of law, confirmed by the jurisprudence of
 his Court, that a party which advances a point of fact in support of its
claim must establish that fact (Application of the Convention on the Pre-
vention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, p. 75,
para. 204, citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nica-
ragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admis-
sibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101).

 5.3. Legal status of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh before the 1840s


5.3.1. Original title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
  46. In light of the respective claims of the Parties in the present case,
 he Court will first examine whether Malaysia, which contends that its
predecessor — the Sultanate of Johor — held original title to Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh and retained it up to the 1840s, has established
ts claim.
  47. Malaysia argues that
     “[t]he Sultanate [of Johor] covered all the islands within this large
     area, including all those in the Singapore Straits, such as Pulau Batu
     Puteh and the islands to the north and south of the Straits, taking in
     Singapore Island and the adjacent islands”
and points to the fact that “Pulau Batu Puteh, sitting at the eastern
entrance of the Singapore Straits, lies right in the middle of the old Sul-
 anate of Johor”.
   48. In support of its claim, Malaysia asserts that the island in question
had always been part of the territory of the Sultan of Johor since the
kingdom came into existence and could not at any relevant time be con-
sidered as terra nullius and hence susceptible of acquisition through occu-


pation. It claims that “rather it is the case that from time immemorial
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was under the sovereignty of the Sultan-
ate of Johor”. According to Malaysia, its situation is similar to that
depicted in the award rendered in the Meerauge arbitration, from which
 t quotes the following :
        “Possession immemorial is that which has lasted for such a long
     time that it is impossible to provide evidence of a different situation
     and of which anybody recalls having heard talk.” (Meerauge Arbi-
     tral Award (Austria/Hungary), 13 September 1902, German origi-
     nal text in Nouveau recueil général de traités, 3rd Series, Vol. III,
     p. 80 ; translation into English provided by Malaysia from the French
     translation in Revue de droit international et de législation comparée,
     Tome VIII, 2nd Series (1906), p. 207.)
   49. By contrast, Singapore advances its contention that Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh, prior to 1847, had been terra nullius susceptible of the
 awful taking of possession by the United Kingdom in 1847-1851. As for
Malaysia’s position that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was part of the
Sultanate of “Old Johor”, Singapore contends that there is no evidence
 hat the Johor Sultanate claimed or exercised authority over Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, during its first period (1512-1641) which began
 n 1512 with the fall of the Malacca Sultanate to the Portuguese, and dur-
 ng which Old Johor was constantly harried by the Portuguese and the
Kingdom of Aceh, during its second period (1641-1699), when the Dutch,
 n alliance with Johor drove the Portuguese out of Malacca and when the
power and influence of Johor was at its height, during its third period
 1699-1784) when the death of Sultan Mahmud II without a clear heir led
 o a period of internal strife and instability during which many vassals
broke away from the Johor Sultanate, or during the fourth period (1784-
1824), when “the old empire was in a state of dissolution”.



  50. Thus Singapore concludes that “there is no evidence that Pedra
Branca belonged to the Johor Sultanate at any point in its history and
certainly not at the beginning of the nineteenth century”.

   51. Singapore has offered no further specific evidence to substantiate
 ts claim relating to the status of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as
 erra nullius prior to the construction of the lighthouse on it in 1847.
Instead, it emphasizes that Malaysia, for its part, has submitted hardly
any evidence to prove that the Sultanate of Johor had indeed effective
control in the region, and specifically over the island of Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh. Singapore, quoting from the official 1949 Annual
Report published by the Government of the State of Johor, according to
which by the beginning of the nineteenth century “the old empire was in
a state of dissolution”, concludes that “[t]his was the political condition


of the Sultanate in 1819 when the British arrived in Singapore, and on the
eve of the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824”.

                                       *
   52. Regarding the question as to whether “[t]he Sultanate [of Johor]
covered all the islands within this large area [of its territory], including all
 hose in the Singapore Straits, such as Pulau Batu Puteh . . .”, the Court
starts by observing that it is not disputed that the Sultanate of Johor,
since it came into existence in 1512, established itself as a sovereign State
with a certain territorial domain under its sovereignty in this part of
southeast Asia.
   53. Thus already at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
Hugo Grotius, commenting on the military conflict between the Sultan-
ate of Johor and Portugal, stated that :
       “There is in India a kingdom called Johore, which has long been
     considered a sovereign principality [supremi principatus], so that its
     ruler clearly possessed the authority necessary to conduct a public
     war [against the Portuguese].” (Hugo Grotius, De Jure Praedae,
     Vol. I Translation, 1950 (Gwladys L. Williams), Classics of Inter-
     national Law, p. 314.)
   54. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the Dutch Governor of
Malacca wrote a letter to the Dutch East India Company proposing that
 he Dutch East India Company send two boats to the Straits of Singa-
pore to “cruise to the south of Singapore Straits under the Hook of Bar-
bukit and in the vicinity of Pedra Branca” in order to prevent Chinese
 raders from entering Johor River. The proposal made in the letter was
pursued, and two junks were taken in the Straits and diverted to Malacca.
However, this incident led to a protest from the Sultan. According to the
report of the Governor-General in Batavia to the Dutch East India Com-
pany in Amsterdam :
     “The king of Johor ha[d] sent an envoy to the governor of Melaka to
     indicate his great displeasure regarding the seizure of the above-
     mentioned two junks, not without using offensive and threatening
     terms in the event that the same thing occurs in the future.”
   55. It is the view of the Court that this incident is a clear indication of
 he Sultan of Johor’s position that the seizure of the junks in the waters
 n question was an infringement of his right as sovereign in the area con-
cerned.
   56. Coming to the early decades of the nineteenth century, the Court
notes that three letters, all from 1824, written by the British Resident in
Singapore, John Crawfurd, are of particular relevance. First, in his report
of 10 January 1824 to the Government of India, John Crawfurd recalled
 hat in 1819, when the Settlement of Singapore was established, the Sul-
 anate of Johor extended on the Continent from Malacca to the extrem-


 ty of the peninsula on both coasts and embraced “all the islands in the
Mouth of the Straits of Malacca with all those in the China Seas as far as
 he Natunas” (emphasis added). The Natunas islands are a long way to
 he east of the Straits of Singapore, at approximately 4° North and
109° East or roughly north of the west coast of Borneo. Second, in a let-
 er of 3 August 1824 reporting on the Treaty signed the previous day,
Crawfurd stated that the cession by Johor was not only of the main
 sland “but extends to the Seas, Straits and Islets (the latter probably not
 ess than 50 in number) within ten geographical miles of its
coasts . . .” (emphasis in the original). Third, in a letter of 1 October
1824 to the Government of India, he commented on the possible
 nconvenience of the exclusion imposed by the 1824 Anglo-Dutch
Treaty on the British Government from entering into political
relations with the chiefs of all the islands lying South to the Straits of
Singapore, in the following terms :


        “It does not upon the whole appear to me that the occupation of
     Rhio could be beneficial to the British Government, yet its retention
     on the part of the Netherlands Government, and our exclusion from
     entering into political relations with the Chiefs of all the islands
     lying South to the Straits of Singapore and between the peninsula
     and Sumatra may prove a matter of some inconvenience to us, as it
     is in fact virtually amounts to a dismemberment of the Principality
     of Johor, and must thus be productive of some embarrassment and
     confusion. This may be easily illustrated by an example. The Cari-
     mon Islands and the Malayan Settlement of Bulang are two of the
     principal possessions of the Tumongong of Johor or Singapore, and
     his claim to them is not only allowed by the rival chiefs but satisfac-
     torily ascertained by the voluntary and cheerful allegiance yielded to
     him by the inhabitants. By the present Treaty, however, he must
     either forego all claims to these possessions, or removing to them,
     renounce his connection with the British Government.” (Emphasis
     added.)
The Court observes that, as confirmed by the above documents, the sen-
or British official in the region understood that, before it was divided,
he Sultanate of Johor had an extensive maritime component which
ncluded “all” the islands in the region of the Straits of Singapore.

   57. In an article from the Singapore Free Press, dated 25 May 1843
and reporting on “[t]he frequent and regular occurrence of acts of Piracy
 n the immediate neighbourhood of Singapore”, it was stated as follows :
       “The places and Islands near which these piracies are most fre-
     quently committed and where the pirates go for shelter and conceal-
     ment, such as Pulo Tinghie, Batu Puteh, Point Romania & c, are all


     within the territories of our well beloved ally and pensionary, the
     Sultan of Johore, or rather of the Tomungong of Johore, for he is
     the real Sovereign.”
   58. The Court notes that Singapore rejects this last piece of evidence
on the grounds that “its probative value is highly suspect considering it
does not indicate the source of the information or even the name of its
author”. However, the Court considers the probative value of this report
 o lie in the fact that it corroborates other evidence that Johor had sov-
ereignty over the area in question.
   59. Thus from at least the seventeenth century until early in the nine-
 eenth it was acknowledged that the territorial and maritime domain of
 he Kingdom of Johor comprised a considerable portion of the Malaya
Peninsula, straddled the Straits of Singapore and included islands and
 slets in the area of the Straits. Specifically, this domain included the area
where Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is located.


                                      *
   60. It now falls to the Court, after having described the general un-
derstanding at the relevant time of the extent of Johor, to ascertain
whether the original title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh claimed by
Malaysia is founded in law.
   61. Of significance in the present context is the fact that Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh had always been known as a navigational hazard in the
Straits of Singapore, an important channel for international navigation
 n east-west trade connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea.
It is therefore impossible that the island could have remained unknown
or undiscovered by the local community. Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
evidently was not terra incognita. It is thus reasonable to infer that Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was viewed as one of the islands lying within
 he general geographical scope of the Sultanate of Johor.

   62. Another factor of significance which the Court has to take into
consideration in assessing the issue of the original title in the present case
 s the fact that throughout the entire history of the old Sultanate of
Johor, there is no evidence that any competing claim had ever been
advanced over the islands in the area of the Straits of Singapore.
   63. It is appropriate to recall the pronouncement made by the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice in the case concerning the Legal Sta-
 us of Eastern Greenland, on the significance of the absence of rival
claims. In that case it was the Danish contention that “Denmark pos-
sessed full and entire sovereignty over the whole of Greenland and that
Norway had recognized that sovereignty”, whereas the Norwegian con-
 ention was that all the parts of Greenland “which had not been occupied
 n such a manner as to bring them effectively under the administration of
 he Danish Government” were “terrae nullius, and that if they ceased to


be terrae nullius they must pass under Norwegian sovereignty” (Legal
Status of Eastern Greenland, Judgment, 1933, P.C.I.J., Series A/B,
No. 53, p. 39).
  64. Against this background the Court stated :
        “Another circumstance which must be taken into account by any
     tribunal which has to adjudicate upon a claim to sovereignty over a
     particular territory, is the extent to which the sovereignty is also
     claimed by some other Power. In most of the cases involving claims
     to territorial sovereignty which have come before an international
     tribunal, there have been two competing claims to the sovereignty,
     and the tribunal has had to decide which of the two is the stronger.
     One of the peculiar features of the present case is that up to 1931
     there was no claim by any Power other than Denmark to the sov-
     ereignty over Greenland. Indeed, up till 1921, no Power disputed the
     Danish claim to sovereignty.” (Ibid., p. 46.)


  65. On this basis, the Court came to the following conclusion :
     “bearing in mind the absence of any claim to sovereignty by another
     Power, and the Arctic and inaccessible character of the uncolonized
     parts of the country, the King of Denmark and Norway displayed . . .
     in 1721 to 1814 his authority to an extent sufficient to give his coun-
     try a valid claim to sovereignty, and that his rights over Greenland
     were not limited to the colonized area” (ibid., pp. 50-51).

   66. If this conclusion was valid with reference to the thinly populated
and unsettled territory of Eastern Greenland, it should also apply to the
present case involving a tiny uninhabited and uninhabitable island, to
which no claim of sovereignty had been made by any other Power
 hroughout the years from the early sixteenth century until the middle of
 he nineteenth century.
   67. The Court further recalls that, as expounded in the Eastern Green-
 and case (see paragraph 64 above), international law is satisfied with
varying degrees in the display of State authority, depending on the spe-
cific circumstances of each case.
   Moreover, as pointed out in the Island of Palmas case, State authority
should not necessarily be displayed “in fact at every moment on every
point of a territory” (Island of Palmas Case (Netherlands/United States
of America), Award of 4 April 1928, RIAA, Vol. II (1949), p. 840). It was
 urther stated in the Award that :

       “[I]n the exercise of territorial sovereignty there are necessarily
     gaps, intermittence in time and discontinuity in space . . . The fact
     that a state cannot prove display of sovereignty as regards such a
     portion of territory cannot forthwith be interpreted as showing that


     sovereignty is inexistent. Each case must be appreciated in accord-
     ance with the particular circumstances.” (Island of Palmas Case
     (Netherlands/United States of America), Award of 4 April 1928,
     RIAA, Vol. II (1949), p. 855.)

   68. Having considered the actual historical and geographical context
of the present case relating to the old Sultanate of Johor, the Court con-
cludes that as far as the territorial domain of the Sultanate of Johor was
concerned, it did cover in principle all the islands and islets within the
Straits of Singapore, which lay in the middle of this kingdom, and did
 hus include the island of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. This posses-
sion of the islands by the old Sultanate of Johor was never challenged by
any other Power in the region and can in all the circumstances be seen as
satisfying the condition of “continuous and peaceful display of territorial
sovereignty (peaceful in relation to other States)” (ibid., p. 839).

  69. The Court thus concludes that the Sultanate of Johor had original
itle to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.

                                     *
   70. Malaysia further argues that the title of the Sultanate of Johor to
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is confirmed by the ties of loyalty that
existed between the Sultanate and the Orang Laut, “the people of the
sea”. The Orang Laut were engaged in various activities such as fishing
and piratical activities in the waters in the Straits of Singapore, including
 n the area of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.
   71. Malaysia has provided evidence from the nineteenth century which
shows that the Orang Laut, a nomadic people of the sea, made the mari-
 ime areas in the Straits of Singapore their habitat and quite frequently
visited the island, as appears from the following letter from J. T. Thom-
son, the Government Surveyor of Singapore, reporting in November 1850
after the first year of construction of Horsburgh lighthouse on the need
 o exclude the Orang Laut from the construction site :
     “strict rules should be carried out against those half fishing half
     piratical sect the orang Ryot or Laut, being allowed to obtain admit-
     tance into the building — they frequently visit the rock so their visits
     should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them . . . In the
     straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives
     are taken by these people.”
  72. Furthermore John Crawfurd, the British Resident of Singapore,
recorded in his journal of 1828 a visit he had received from “some indi-
viduals of the race of Malays, called Orang Laut, — that is, ‘men of the
sea’”, and stated as follows :
       “They have a rough exterior, and their speech is awkward and un-


     couth, but, in other respects, I could observe little essential differ-
     ence between them and other Malays. These people have adopted
     the Mohammedan religion. They are divided into, at least, twenty
     tribes, distinguished usually by the straits or narrow seas they prin-
     cipally frequent. A few of them have habitations on shore, but by far
     the greater number live constantly in their boats, and nearly their

John Crawfurd, Edward Presgrave, the Registrar of Imports and Exports
of the British administration in Singapore, also stated in his Report of
1828 on the subject of piracy to the Resident Counsellor as follows :

        “The subjects of the Sultan of Johor who inhabit the Islands are
     usually by the Malays termed Orang Rayat — the common oriental
     word signifying a subject generally, but is here restricted to one class
     of the Sultan’s subjects. They live in small and detached communi-
     ties or settlements on the several islands under the immediate control
     of two officers called Orang Kaya and Batin, the latter being subor-
     dinate to the former, these officers are appointed by the Sultan of
     Johore.
     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
        Differences arising among the parties which cannot be settled by
     the Panglima [i.e., Captain] are reserved for the decision of the
     Chief, or of the Sultan himself on their return . . .
        Such are the habits and mode of life of the Rayats of Johor. The
     Sultan of Johor can on emergency (such as a war with a neighbour-
     ing Chief) command their services. On such an occasion it is said he
     can assemble from the several Islands and places under his authority
     from three hundred to four hundred prows.” (Emphasis added.)

   74. The Court considers that these descriptions of the nature and the
 evel of the ties of relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the
Orang Laut in contemporary official reports by British officials operating
 n the region have a high probative value in establishing the existence of
sufficient political authority by the Sultan of Johor to qualify him as
exercising sovereign authority over the Orang Laut. The Court observes
 hat these statements showed an understanding by the responsible British


officials in Singapore that the Orang Laut were subjects of the Sultan of
Johor and acted under his authority when need arose.
  75. Given the above, the Court finds that the nature and degree of the
Sultan of Johor’s authority exercised over the Orang Laut who inhabited
 he islands in the Straits of Singapore, and who made this maritime area
 heir habitat, confirms the ancient original title of the Sultanate of Johor
 o those islands, including Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.


                                     *
  76. Singapore, in support of its assertion that the Sultan of Johor did
not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, advances
another argument based on what it describes as “the traditional Malay
concept of sovereignty”. Thus it contends :

     “Malaysia has glossed over . . . the traditional Malay concept of sov-
     ereignty. This concept undermines Malaysia’s claim to an original
     title. It is based mainly on control over people, and not control over
     territory. Traditional Malay sovereignty is people-centric and not
     territory-centric.”

  77. Relying on some writings of scholars on Malay political culture,
Singapore develops this argument into the following assertion :
       “What it means is that the only reliable way to determine whether
     a particular territory belonged to a ruler is to find out whether the
     inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler . . .
       . . . the concept also means that it was difficult to determine with
     accuracy the territorial extent of the Johor Sultanate at any time . . .

       This would certainly be the case with regard to barren, isolated
     and uninhabited islands, such as Pedra Branca. Therefore, unless
     Malaysia can produce clear evidence of a direct claim to or the
     actual exercise of sovereign authority over Pedra Branca, any attempt
     to argue that the island belonged to old Johor is totally devoid of
     merit.”
 78. Malaysia disputes this argument even as a valid theory applicable
o Malay political history. It states as follows :

       “Authority in States throughout the world has characteristically
     been based on a combination of control over people and over terri-
     tory. This applies to the Malay States as well as any other. The fact
     that Singapore can demonstrate shifting political fortunes and even
     division within the royal household of Johor does not undermine
     conceptions of continuity in a Malay polity . . . Ever since the estab-


     lishment of the Sultanate of Johor in the early 16th century, there
     have always been rulers who were recognized as such and who com-
     manded the allegiance of the people accordingly and thereby held
     sway over the territory where those people lived.”
   79. With regard to Singapore’s assertion about the existence of a “tra-
ditional Malay concept of sovereignty” based on control over people
rather than on control over territory, the Court observes that sovereignty
comprises both elements, personal and territorial. In any event, it need
not deal with this matter any further as the Court has already found that
Johor had territorial sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
 see paragraph 69 above), and has found confirmation of this title in the
Sultan of Johor’s exercise of authority over the Orang Laut, who inhab-
 ted or visited the islands in the Straits of Singapore, including Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh (see paragraph 75 above).


                                     *
 80. The Court, having found that in 1824 the Sultan of Johor had title
o Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, will now turn to the question whether
his title was affected by the developments in the period 1824 to 1840.


5.3.2. The legal significance of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty
  81. An argument advanced by Singapore against Johor’s sovereignty
over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is that “in the period relevant to
Malaysia’s claim, there were two different political entities in the region
 hat were called ‘Johor’”.

  82. Singapore argues that Malaysia’s claim to Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh, which is based on two propositions — the first that Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh had belonged to old Johor, and the second that
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh became part of new Johor — cannot be
accepted, since “[t]he first proposition is not supported by any evidence”,
and “[t]he second proposition is therefore irrelevant”.

  83. On this second proposition of Malaysia, namely that Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh became part of the new Johor, Singapore contends
 hat :
        “Malaysia tries to prove this proposition by arguing that the effect
     of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty was to split the Johor Sultanate into two
     parts and to place Pedra Branca in the northern part within the Brit-
     ish sphere of influence, thus allocating it to new Johor. This is a mis-
     representation of the Treaty.”



   84. Thus, Singapore disputes that the Sultanate of Johor had contin-
ued since 1512 through the whole period relevant to the present case as
 he same sovereign entity. It claims that the “new Sultanate of Johor”,
which came into existence in the context of the division of the “old Sul-
 anate of Johor”, is to be distinguished from the “old Sultanate of Johor”
 alias the “Sultanate of Johor-Riau-Lingga”). In support of this argu-
ment, Singapore, quoting a historian of the region, argues that old Johor,
 he maritime Malay empire that succeeded Malacca, began in 1512 when
 he defeated Sultan of Malacca established a capital on the Johor River,
and gradually disintegrated in the eighteenth century, whereas modern
Johor occupies the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, is one of the
11 states of the Federation of Malaysia, and dates from the mid-nine-
 eenth century.
   85. In assessing the relevance of the argument thus presented by Sing-
apore to the issue of title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, it is neces-
sary to distinguish two different issues : one is whether the sovereign
entity of the Sultanate of Johor continued to exist as the same legal entity
after the division ; and the other whether the territorial domain of the
“new Sultanate of Johor” included Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.

  86. In relation to the first question, the Court concludes from the
documentary evidence submitted by Malaysia, that the Sultanate of
Johor continued to exist as the same sovereign entity throughout the
period 1512 to 1824, in spite of changes in the precise geographical scope
of its territorial domain and vicissitudes of fortune in the Sultanate
 hrough the ages, and that these changes and vicissitudes did not affect
 he legal situation in relation to the area of the Singapore Straits, which
always remained within the territorial domain of the Sultanate of Johor.

  87. On that basis the Court observes that as long as it is established
 hat the old Sultanate of Johor continued as the same legal entity that
became the subject of the division in 1824, the issue of whether the new
Sultanate of Johor under Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong or the new
Sultanate in Riau under Sultan Abdul Rahman was the legal continuator
n title of the “old Sultanate of Johor” before the break, is immaterial in
 he present case. Whatever position the Parties may take in this respect,
 he island in question, i.e., Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, had to come
under the sovereignty of one or other of the Sultanates (see paragraph 100
below).

  88. In relation to the second question, the Court notes that it is com-
mon ground between the Parties that the “old Sultanate of Johor” came
 o be divided in the context of the dynastic rivalry between the two sons
of the late Sultan Mahmud III (see paragraph 23 above) and the com-
peting interests of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in the
region.
  89. It is also common ground between Singapore and Malaysia that


 he 1824 Treaty had the effect, according to Singapore, of “divid[ing] the
region into two spheres of influence” or, according to Malaysia, of
“divid[ing] the Sultanate of Johor into two separate spheres of influ-
ence” — one belonging to the Dutch sphere of influence covering the ter-
ritorial domain of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Abdul Rahman, and
 he other falling under the British sphere of influence covering the terri-
 orial domain of the Sultanate of Johor under Hussein.
   90. However, upon closer examination of this apparent agreement
between Malaysia and Singapore, there emerges a fundamental diver-
gence of views between them concerning the legal significance of the rele-
vant provisions of the 1824 Treaty.
   91. The 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, concluded on 17 March 1824, pro-
vided in its Article 12 as follows :
        “His Netherlands Majesty withdraws the objections which have
     been made to the occupation of the Island of Singapore, by the Sub-
     jects of His Britannick Majesty.
        His Britannick Majesty, however, engages, that no British Estab-
     lishment shall be made on the Carimon Isles, or on the Islands of
     Battam, Bintang, Lingin, or on any of the other Islands south of the
     Straights of Singapore, nor any Treaty concluded by British Author-
     ity with the Chiefs of those Islands.”
  92. The conclusion to be drawn from this provision, according to
counsel for Malaysia, is that :
     “The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 17 March 1824 resulted in the split of
     the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate. It divided the Sultanate of Johor
     into two separate spheres of influence : islands south of the Straits of
     Singapore were left within the Dutch sphere of influence — that was
     the Riau-Lingga Sultanate — while the territory and all islands in
     the Straits of Singapore and to the north of the Straits were placed
     within the British sphere of influence — and that was the Johor Sul-
     tanate.”
   93. By contrast, the interpretation advanced by Singapore of Arti-
cle 12 is the following :
     “the Anglo-Dutch Treaty did not contemplate any demarcation line.
     This is clear from the negotiating history of the Treaty. An earlier
     draft of the Treaty inserted an article providing for a demarcation
     line. But this article was omitted when the text of the Treaty was
     finalized.
        The text of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty also confirms that there is no
     line . . . Article X excludes the Dutch from ‘any part of the Peninsula
     of Malacca’, that is the Malay Peninsula, while Article XII excludes
     the British from ‘any of the islands South of the Straights of Singa-
     pore’. There is no provision excluding either State from any part of
     the straits or any islands within the Strait. In other words, the Treaty
     did not divide up the Strait between the two Powers. The width of


     the entire Strait was left open for access by both States, as was
     intended.”

   94. In sum, the argument that Singapore is advancing is that the
1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty left the entire Straits, including the islands and
 slets therein, except for the islands specifically referred to in Article 12,
open for access, and that since Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, accord-
 ng to Singapore, had always remained terra nullius or had become
 erra nullius as a result of the disappearance of the “old Sultanate of
Johor” by the division of the kingdom, there was a legal vacuum with
regard to sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, thus leaving
room for the “lawful possession” of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh by
 he British during the period 1847-1851.
   95. The object and purpose of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty are stated
 n its Preamble. The two Sovereigns of the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands,
     “desiring to place upon a footing, mutually beneficial, Their respec-
     tive Possessions and the Commerce of Their Subjects in the East
     Indies, so that the welfare and prosperity of both Nations may be
     promoted, in all time to come, without those differences and jealous-
     ies which have, in former times, interrupted the harmony which
     ought always to subsist between Them ; . . . and in order to determine
     certain questions which have occurred in the execution of the Conven-
     tion made at London on the 13th of August, 1814, in so far as it
     respects the Possessions His Netherlands Majesty in the East”
     (emphasis added),
came to conclude this Treaty.
  In the view of the Court it is difficult to read this language to signify
 hat the Parties intended the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty to leave certain
areas of the Straits of Singapore, which had been part of the territorial
and maritime domain of the old Sultanate of Johor, undetermined in
 heir legal status and thus open for occupation.

   96. The Court observes from the reading of this preambular language,
as well as the substantive provisions of Articles 8 to 12 which provide for
a set of mutual territorial adjustments, that the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty
was concluded to settle once and for all the disputes that had developed
between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands relating to their
respective possessions as well as commercial interests in the East Indies
during and in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. What
emerges from this overall picture is that whereas the earlier Convention
of 13 August 1814 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
relative to the Dutch Colonies was somewhat general in its treatment of
 he territorial possessions of the two Powers, the settlement reached in
 his 1824 Treaty is much more specific, covering all the territories thus far


claimed to be in the possession or under the sphere of influence of one or
 he other of these two Powers and identifying their respective spheres of
 nfluence in this part of the East Indies. Against this background, it is
most unlikely that the parties intentionally left these maritime features
within the Straits of Singapore outside the sphere of influence of either of
 he two parties and open for eventual occupation by one of the parties or
another power.
   97. Furthermore, when the whole arrangement contained in this Treaty
 s read against the background of the feud which had developed between
 he two brothers, sons of the late Sultan Mahmud III of the old Sultanate
of Johor, it is contrary to common sense to suppose that the two rival
Sultanates of Johor and of Riau-Lingga, competing for sovereignty over
certain territories in the region, decided to leave this area in the Straits on
 heir border undivided and unclaimed. The Court is of the view that
whatever may have been the legal effect of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty
upon the concrete issue of where the dividing line between the respective
spheres of influence of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands might
 ie in the region, it is impossible to accept that the treaty had left the issue
of the territorial title to the islands lying in the Straits totally unaffected.

   98. In light of this analysis, in the context of the history surrounding
 he conclusion of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, the Court is led to con-
clude that the division of the old Sultanate of Johor and the creation of
 he two Sultanates of Johor and of Riau-Lingga were part of the overall
scheme agreed upon by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands that
came to be reflected in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. In other words, the
Treaty was the legal reflection of a political settlement reached between
 he two colonial Powers, vying for hegemony for many years in this part
of the world, to divide the territorial domain of the old Sultanate of
Johor into two sultanates to be placed under their respective spheres of
 nfluence. Thus in this scheme there was no possibility for any legal
vacuum left for freedom of action to take lawful possession of an island
 n between these two spheres of influence. This political settlement signi-
fied at the same time that the territorial division between the two Sultan-
ates of Johor and of Riau-Lingga was made definitive by the conclusion
of this Anglo-Dutch Treaty.

   99. The question as to which side of the dividing line any particular
 sland or other maritime feature in the Straits of Singapore came to fall as
a result was a matter that the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty did not find it
necessary to specify, other than those islands expressly mentioned in
Article 12 of the Treaty.
   100. The general reference in Article 12 of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch
Treaty to “the other Islands south of the Straights of Singapore” would
suggest that all the islands and islets within the Straits fell on the British
side of the dividing line of the spheres of influence. This naturally covered
 he island of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh whose legal status thus


remained as it had been, i.e. part of the territorial domain of what con-
 inued to be called the “Sultanate of Johor” after the division of the old
Sultanate.
   101. A letter from the Government of India to John Crawfurd dated
4 March 1825, following the conclusion of the Crawfurd Treaty of 1824,
can be taken as a confirmation by the British side of this interpretation,
namely that all the islands within the Straits of Singapore fell within the
British sphere of influence and not of the Dutch. The letter states as fol-
 ows :
        “[O]ur acquisition of these Islets [under the Crawfurd Treaty] is
     not at variance with the obligations of the Treaty concluded at Lon-
     don in March last [i.e., the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824], as they are
     all situated North of the Southern limits of the Straights of
     Singapore . . .” (Emphasis added.)

   It is clear from this sentence that the British Government of India
 hought that the dividing line between what belonged to the sphere of
 nfluence of the United Kingdom and what belonged to that of the Neth-
erlands in accordance with the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty was “the South-
ern limits of the Straits of Singapore” (emphasis added) and that every
 sland north of that line came within the territorial domain belonging to
 he sphere of influence of the United Kingdom.


5.3.3. The relevance of the 1824 Crawfurd Treaty
   102. A few months after the conclusion of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch
Treaty, the East India Company and the Sultan and the Temenggong of
Johor entered into a new Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 2 August
1824, known as the “Crawfurd Treaty”. By this Treaty the Sultan and
Temenggong of Johor ceded the island of Singapore to the East India
Company. The Crawfurd Treaty specifies the geographical scope of the
cession of the island of Singapore, together with adjacent seas, straits and
 slets, to the extent of 10 geographical miles from the coast of Singapore.
   103. Specifically, Article II of the Crawfurd Treaty provided as fol-
 ows :
         “Their Highnesses the Sultan Hussain Mahomed Shah and
      Datu Tumungong Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah hereby cede in full
      sovereignty and property to the Honourable the English East India
      Company, their heirs and successors for ever, the Island of Singa-
      pore, situated in the Straits of Malacca, together with the adjacent
      seas, straits, and islets, to the extent of ten geographical miles, from
      the coast of the said main Island of Singapore.”
   104. On the basis of this provision, Malaysia argues that “Johor could
not have ceded the territory of Singapore Island and islets situated within
 en geographical (i.e. nautical) miles to the English East India Company


 f Johor did not have title to it”. Thus, according to Malaysia, “the fact
 hat it had a title which it was capable of ceding shows that the Johor title
 o the area before 1824 included both PBP and sovereignty over Singa-
pore”.
   105. In the view of Malaysia, even though Singapore agrees that the
cession of Singapore by the Sultan and Temenggong of Johor was
effected by the Crawfurd Treaty, Singapore nevertheless fails to appreci-
ate that this important constitutive document on the establishment of
Singapore also confirms formal British recognition of prior and continu-
 ng sovereignty of the Sultanate of Johor over all other islands in and
around the Straits of Singapore. The Crawfurd Treaty provides, in
unequivocal terms, that the cession is confined to the islands of Singapore
 tself and the area, including seas, straits and islets, within 10 geographi-
cal miles of the mainland of Singapore. Malaysia thus contends that title
 o other territories and sea areas remained where it was, namely with the
Sultanate of Johor.

   106. Singapore accepts that its claim to sovereignty over Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh “is not based on the Treaty of Cession of 1824” since
“[t]hat Treaty dealt only with the main island of Singapore and its imme-
diate vicinity [and] did not extend to the area around Pedra Branca”
 emphasis in the original). However, Singapore dismisses the Crawfurd
Treaty of 1824 as simply “irrelevant” to the issue of title to Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh, rejecting the argument advanced by Malaysia that by
accepting this cession the British recognized the authority of the Sultan
and the Temenggong of Johor to effect a transfer of title in relation to
 slands in the Straits of Singapore.


   107. The Court agrees that the Crawfurd Treaty cannot be relied on as
establishing “British recognition of prior and continuing sovereignty of
 he Sultanate of Johor over all other islands in and around the Strait of
Singapore” as Malaysia claims. Article II speaks only of the cession of
“the Island of Singapore . . . together with the adjacent seas, straits, and
 slets to the extent of ten geographical miles” and cannot, in and by itself,
be interpreted as formal recognition by the United Kingdom that the Sul-
 an and the Temenggong of Johor had “prior and continuing sover-
eignty” over any and all of the islands in the Straits of Singapore, includ-
 ng Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. On the other hand neither does this
finding signify a contrario that the islands in the Straits of Singapore fall-
 ng outside the scope of Article II of this Treaty were terrae nullius and
could be subject to appropriation through “lawful occupation”. This lat-
 er point can only be judged in the context of what legal effect the divi-
sion of the old Sultanate of Johor had upon the islands in the area of the
Straits of Singapore, in particular in light of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch
Treaty (see above, paragraphs 95-101) and in light of the legal relevance,
vel non, of the so-called letter “of donation” of 1825 sent from Sul-


 an Abdul Rahman of Riau-Lingga to his brother Sultan Hussein of
Johor (see below, paragraphs 108-116).



5.3.4. The legal significance of the letter “of donation” of 1825
  108. Singapore claims that “The Anglo-Dutch Treaty did not, by its
erms, effect a division of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate.” According
o Singapore,
     “the subsequent dismemberment of the Sultanate resulted from the
     practical fact that Sultan Abdul Rahman (who in the eyes of the
     locals was the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau-Lingga
     Sultanate) . . . could no longer exert effective power in the Malay
     Peninsula (which had fallen within the British sphere) . . . The terri-
     torial extent of the northern breakaway fragments (i.e., peninsular
     Johor and Pahang) is not determined by the terms of the Anglo-
     Dutch Treaty but by subsequent acts of and dealings amongst the
     relevant Malay rulers.”
   109. Singapore argues that instead of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, it
was the letter “of donation” (see paragraph 23 above) from Sultan Abdul
Rahman to his brother Hussein which had the legal effect of transferring
 he title to the territory included in that letter “of donation”. Thus it
claims :
        “One example of such dealing was the express donation of terri-
     tory by Sultan Abdul Rahman to Sultan Hussein one year after the
     Anglo-Dutch Treaty was signed. This donation was made on the
     advice of the Dutch, who wished to avoid any confusion over which
     territories remained under the control of Sultan Abdul Rahman in
     the post Anglo-Dutch Treaty period. In 1825, they sent an official . . .
     to explain to the Sultan the implications of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty
     and to advise him to formally cede the mainland territories of Johor
     and Pahang to his brother Hussein.”

  110. Sultan Abdul Rahman’s letter reads as follows :
        “Your brother sends you this letter . . . to give you notice of the
     conclusion of a treaty between His Majesty the King of the Nether-
     lands and His Majesty the King of Great Britain, whereby the divi-
     sion of the lands of Johor, Pahang, Riau and Lingga is stipulated.
     The part of the lands assigned to you, My Brother, I donate to you
     with complete satisfaction, and sincere affection, for we are brothers
     and the only children left behind by our father.
     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
        Your territory, thus, extends over Johor and Pahang on the main-
     land or on the Malay Peninsula. The territory of Your Brother


     extends out over the Islands of Lingga, Bintan, Galang, Bulan, Kari-
     mon and all other islands. Whatsoever may be in the sea, this is the
     territory of Your Brother, and whatever is situated on the mainland
     is yours. On the basis of these premises I earnestly beseech you that
     your notables, the Paduka Bendahara of Pahang and Temeng-
     gong Abdul Rahman, will not in the slightest concern themselves
     with the islands that belong to Your Brother.”
  111. On this basis, Singapore argues that
     “[t]he nature and terms of Sultan Abdul Rahman’s donation of ter-
     ritories to Sultan Hussein is another impediment to Malaysia’s claim
     that original title to Pedra Branca is derived from the Johor-Riau-
     Lingga Sultanate”.

The argument of Singapore is that from the terms of that letter, it is clear
 hat Sultan Abdul Rahman donated only the mainland territories to his
brother Sultan Hussein, and retained for himself all islands in the sea.
Singapore further argues that “even if Pedra Branca was a possession
of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate (which it was not), it would have
been retained by Sultan Abdul Rahman and not become part of the
State of Johor”.
  112. Malaysia challenges this argument as follows :
        “In its Counter-Memorial Singapore suggests that it was not the
     Anglo-Dutch Treaty that determined the extent of the Johor Sultan-
     ate but instead the donation by Sultan Abdul Rahman by letter of
     25 June 1825 of mainland territories in peninsular Malaya to his
     brother Sultan Hussain in 1825 . . .
        The ‘donation’ of Sultan Abdul Rahman must be read in the con-
     text of what is stipulated under Article XII of the Anglo-Dutch
     Treaty of 1824. By no means does it serve as Johor’s title to its ter-
     ritory. The territories specified by Sultan Abdul Rahman to be his
     own (the one under the Dutch sphere of influence) in the letter of
     25 June 1825 comprise ‘the Islands of Lingga, Bintan, Galang,
     Bulan, Karimon and all other islands’. Out of these five specified
     islands, three were mentioned in Article XII of the Anglo-Dutch
     Treaty of 1824 (namely, the Carimon Islands, Bintang and Lingga)
     while the remaining two (Galang and Bulan) are islands clearly lying
     south of the Strait of Singapore. The phrase ‘all other islands’ refers
     to all other islands lying within the Dutch sphere of influence and
     not named explicitly in the letter, e.g. Batam and Singkep. To sum
     up, this letter was not a ‘donation’ but was instead a formal recogni-
     tion that Sultan Abdul Rahman did not claim sovereignty over
     Johor.”

  113. The Court considers the fundamental question to be whether the
“donation” described in the letter of Sultan Abdul Rahman can be


regarded as having the legal effect of conveying title to the territories
referred to therein. In order for this to be the case, it has to be established
 hat the territories in question had been under the sovereignty of the Sul-
 an of Riau-Lingga. In this respect, Singapore claims that Sul-
 an Abdul Rahman “in the eyes of the locals was the legitimate ruler of
 he Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate” and that he followed the advice of a
Dutch official “to formally cede the mainland territories of Johor and
Pahang to his brother Hussein”.

   114. The letter no doubt was an expression of Sultan Abdul Rahman’s
definitive intention to renounce his claim to title to these territories and
as such could produce that legal effect. However, with regard to territo-
ries referred to expressly or by implication in his letter “of donation”, but
over which he held no title proven to the satisfaction of the Court, his
donation was without effect.

   115. The Court concludes that the old Sultanate of Johor was divided
 n 1824 into the Sultanate of Johor with Sultan Hussein as its sovereign
and the Sultanate of Riau-Lingga with Sultan Abdul Rahman as its sov-
ereign although the dividing line between them remained somewhat un-
clear. The 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty reflected the division as between the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands in the form of their respective
spheres of influence (see paragraphs 81-101 above). The so-called letter
“of donation” from Sultan Abdul Rahman to his brother Hussein con-
firmed that division.
   116. Moreover, the cession of Singapore and the other islands by the
Sultan and the Temenggong of Johor in 1824 would have been possible
only if the Sultanate of Johor had had valid title to them. This act of
cession took place soon after the conclusion of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch
Treaty, but before the act of “donation” of the territories that included
 hose referred to in the Crawfurd Treaty as the object of the cession. This
sequence of events can only be understood as reinforcing the interpreta-
 ion of the act of “donation” given above. Were the Court to accept
Singapore’s argument (see paragraph 109 above) there would have
been no legal basis on which Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong of
Johor could have ceded the island of Singapore to the East India
Company in 1824.



5.3.5. Conclusion

  117. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that Malaysia
has established to the satisfaction of the Court that as of the time when
 he British started their preparations for the construction of the light-
house on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh in 1844, this island was under
 he sovereignty of the Sultan of Johor.


          5.4. Legal status of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
                             after the 1840s

5.4.1. Applicable law

   118. As the Court has shown in the preceding part of this Judgment,
Johor had sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh at the time
 he planning for the construction of the lighthouse on the island began.
Singapore does not contend that anything had happened before then
which could provide any basis for an argument that it or its predecessors
had acquired sovereignty. But Singapore does of course contend that it
has acquired sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh since
1844. The Singapore argument is based on the construction and opera-
 ion of Horsburgh lighthouse and the many other actions it took on, and
 n relation to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, as well as on the conduct
of Johor and its successors. By contrast, Malaysia contends that all of
 hose actions of the United Kingdom were simply actions of the operator
of the lighthouse, being carried out precisely in terms of the permission
which Johor granted in the circumstances which the Court will soon con-
sider.
   119. Whether Malaysia has retained sovereignty over Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh following 1844 or whether sovereignty has since passed
 o Singapore can be determined only on the basis of the Court’s assess-
ment of the relevant facts as they occurred since 1844 by reference to the
governing principles and rules of international law. The relevant facts
consist mainly of the conduct of the Parties during that period.

   120. Any passing of sovereignty might be by way of agreement between
 he two States in question. Such an agreement might take the form of a
 reaty, as with the 1824 Crawfurd Treaty and the 1927 Agreement
referred to earlier (paragraphs 22, 28 and 102). The agreement might
 nstead be tacit and arise from the conduct of the Parties. International
 aw does not, in this matter, impose any particular form. Rather it places
 ts emphasis on the parties’ intentions (cf. e.g. Temple of Preah Vihear
(Cambodia v. Thailand), Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports 1961,
pp. 17, 31).
   121. Under certain circumstances, sovereignty over territory might
pass as a result of the failure of the State which has sovereignty to
respond to conduct à titre de souverain of the other State or, as
Judge Huber put it in the Island of Palmas case, to concrete manifesta-
 ions of the display of territorial sovereignty by the other State (Island of
Palmas Case (Netherlands/United States of America), Award of
4 April 1928, RIAA, Vol. II, (1949) p. 839). Such manifestations of the
display of sovereignty may call for a response if they are not to be oppos-
able to the State in question. The absence of reaction may well amount to
acquiescence. The concept of acquiescence



       “is equivalent to tacit recognition manifested by unilateral conduct
       which the other party may interpret as consent . . .” (Delimitation of
       the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United
       States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 305,
       para. 130).

That is to say, silence may also speak, but only if the conduct of the other
State calls for a response.
   122. Critical for the Court’s assessment of the conduct of the Parties is
 he central importance in international law and relations of State sover-
eignty over territory and of the stability and certainty of that sovereignty.
Because of that, any passing of sovereignty over territory on the basis of
 he conduct of the Parties, as set out above, must be manifested clearly
and without any doubt by that conduct and the relevant facts. That is
especially so if what may be involved, in the case of one of the Parties, is
 n effect the abandonment of sovereignty over part of its territory.


  123. One feature of the arguments on the law presented by the Parties
should be mentioned at this point. Singapore, as has already been dis-
cussed, contended that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was terra nullius
 n 1847 (see paragraph 40 above). Recognizing however that the Court
might reject that contention, Singapore submitted that even in that event,
 hat is to say on the basis that “Malaysia could somehow show an his-
 oric title over the island, Singapore would still possess sovereignty over
Pedra Branca since Singapore has exercised continuous sovereignty over
 he island while Malaysia has done nothing”. It is true that it had shortly
before said that “the notion of prescription . . . has no role to play in the
present case” but that was said on the basis that, as Singapore saw the
case, Malaysia had not made out its historic title.

   124. Malaysia, in response to this argument on prescription, recog-
nized that Singapore may have been intending to give the impression that
 here was “still some way in which the Court can override Johor’s title on
 he basis of Britain’s post-1851 conduct”. While Malaysia considered
 hat that conduct could not properly be taken into account — Johor had
 he historic title and Singapore “quite properly acknowledge[d] that ‘an
argument . . . predicated on the notion of prescription . . . has no role to
play in the present case’” — Malaysia in its oral argument, as in its writ-
 en pleadings, nevertheless addressed that post-1851 conduct at length, as
of course did Singapore for which it was an essential part of its case,
whatever the outcome of the submissions about historic title and terra
nullius. And the “acknowledgment” by Singapore, to which Malaysia
referred, was stated on the hypothesis that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh was terra nullius.

     125. The Court accordingly will now examine the relevant facts, par-


 icularly the conduct of the Parties, relating to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh, to determine whether or not sovereignty over it has passed and is
now with Singapore.

5.4.2. The process for the selection of the site for Horsburgh lighthouse
   126. James Horsburgh, who as hydrographer to the East Indies Com-
pany had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the East
Indies, China, New Holland, the Cape of Good Hope and intermediate
ports, died in May 1836. Merchants and mariners resolved, initially in
Canton, that the appropriate memorial and testimony of gratitude would
be the construction and operation of one or more lighthouses. As early
as November 1836 “Pedra Branca” was identified as a preferred location
and, although other possibilities were mentioned in the following years,
when Jardine Matheson & Co., Treasurer to the China Fund for a testi-
monial of the late James Horsburgh, first wrote to the Governor of Sing-
apore, on 1 March 1842, “Pedra Branca” was the only locality they spe-
cifically mentioned. That letter is the first formal communication on
behalf of the subscribers to the British authorities. The Treasurer advised
 he Governor that :


        “At a general meeting of the subscribers, a wish was expressed
     that the contributions should, if possible, be devoted to the building
     of a Light House, bearing the name of Horsburgh, on Pedra Branca,
     at the entrance of the China Sea, but nothing definitive was resolved
     on.
        As this is a design which can only be carried into effect and main-
     tained under the immediate auspices of the British Government, we
     beg to express our readiness to hand over the above amount to you
     in the hope that you will have the goodness to cause a Light House
     (called after Horsburgh) to be erected either on Pedra Branca, or on
     such other locality as the Government of the Hon’ble East India
     Company may deem preferable.
        The amount is far from adequate ; but we trust the well known
     munificience of the Hon’ble Company will supply what additional
     funds may be wanting for an object of such eminent public utility,
     intended at the same time, to do Honor to the memory of one of the
     most meritorious of their servants.”
The Court notes the recognition by the private commercial interests that
 he British Government would have to carry the proposal into effect and
provide the further funds.
  127. In his reply of 4 April 1842, the Governor indicated his prefer-
ence, which he had recommended to the Governor-General of India
Council, for Tree Island or such other locality as the East India Com-
pany may deem feasible. (Tree Island, at the western end of the Straits,


had been suggested in December 1836 by a number of merchants and
mariners, along with Pedra Branca, in a memorial to the Government of
India.) By July 1842 his preferred location was Barn Island, which was
about 16 miles from Singapore, on the basis of a proposal by John Thom-
son, the newly appointed Government Surveyor at Singapore. That pro-
posal, as recommended to the Government of India, had associated with
 t the imposition of a charge on vessels anchoring in Singapore Roads.
Because the East India Company opposed the levying of harbour and
anchorage duties and the British mercantile community, with the Com-
pany, attached importance to the preservation of the perfect freedom of
 rade at Singapore, the proposal was not even considered.


   128. October and November of 1844 saw a number of significant
developments. On 1 October Captain Sir Edward Belcher reported to
W. J. Butterworth, who had become Governor of the Straits Settlements
 n 1843, his firm opinion that the Romania Outer Island was the most
eligible site. The Parties agree that the island so identified is Peak Rock.
On 20 November, Thomson reported in detail to the Governor on the
structure of a lighthouse on Peak Rock, the method of constructing it, an
estimate of the cost and an undertaking by a contractor to build the light-
house according to the plan. Just days later Governor Butterworth
received replies to letters which he had written to the Sultan and Temeng-
gong of Johor. Notwithstanding the Parties’ extensive research, the Gov-
ernor’s letters have not been found, but the Parties did provide to the
Court copies of the translations of the replies, both dated 25 November
1844. The Sultan wrote as follows :

       “I have received my friend’s letter, and in reply desire to acquaint
     my friend, that I perfectly understand his wishes, and I am exceed-
     ingly pleased at the intention expressed therein, as it (a Light House)
     will enable Traders and others to enter and leave this Port with
     greater Confidence.”
The Temenggong said rather more :
        “I have duly received my friend’s communication, and understand
     the contents. My friend is desirous of erecting a Light House near
     Point Romania. I can have no possible objection to such a measure,
     indeed I am much pleased that such an undertaking is in contempla-
     tion. I wish to be guided in all matters by the Government, so much
     so, that the company are at full liberty to put up a Light House
     there, or any spot deemed eligible.
        Myself and family for many years have derived support from Sing-
     apore, our dependence is wholly on the English Government, and we
     hope to merit the protection of, and be favoured by the Company on
     all occasions consistent with propriety.”


   129. Three days later, on 28 November 1844, the Governor wrote to
 he Secretary of the Government of India. He recalled the rejection of the
Barn Island proposal because of the “restrictive measure on the freedom
of the Port” involved in the proposed charges. The Governor then
referred to the Belcher and Thomson reports, which he enclosed :
        “The funds adverted to, amounting to 5513 Dollars or 12,978.84
     Company’s Rupees, being still forthcoming, as will be perceived by
     the enclosed copy of a letter from Messrs. John Purvis & Co. (A),
     and feeling persuaded of the very great necessity for a Light House
     and the advantage it would prove to the growing Trade with China,
     I took upon myself to submit the subject for the consideration of
     Captain Sir Edward Belcher C.B. in the hope that some site might be
     determined upon which would be free from the objections referred
     to, and meet the object in view. The report (B) of that Scientific
     Officer I desire to lay before the Right Hon’ble the Governor Gen-
     eral of India with the Plan and Section of the Rock therein alluded
     to, prepared by Mr. Thomson the Surveyor, together with an outline
     chart, shewing its position with reference to Pedra Branca, the main
     land of Johore, and Island of Romania situated about 32 miles in an
     E by N direction from Singapore. This Rock is part of the Territo-
     ries of the Rajah of Johore, who with the Tamongong (C) have will-
     ingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company.”
The two replies from the Sultan and Temenggong of 25 November were
also enclosed.
   130. The Governor then listed vessels “Lost or injured by touching on
 he Rock in the vicinity of the site selected”, summarized the enclosed
report from his Government Surveyor, mentioned the “opening of the
 our Ports in China and the Establishment of a Colony at Hong Kong”,
discussed the arrangements for and costs of the operation of the light-
house and concluded as follows :
       “Trusting I have said sufficient to interest the Right Hon’ble the
     Governor General on a subject of such vast importance to the Trade
     of our country and the safety of the mariner, European and native,
     I venture most respectfully to entreat His Honor’s support to the
     measure with the Hon’ble Court of Directors, who may then be
     induced probably in conjunction with Her Majesty’s Govt, to fur-
     nish the additional sum required and order a Lantern to be at once
     constructed. In the meantime, if permitted, I will move the Trading
     Community in aid of a work which will perpetuate their gratitude,
     for the facilities afforded to the Navigation of these seas, by the
     indefatigable researches of James Horsburgh Esquire.”

  131. Two central issues arise from this correspondence. The first is
whether the correspondence extended to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
or was limited to Peak Rock. The second is whether, in terms of the


replies, the sovereignty of Johor over any place under its sovereignty
which was chosen for the lighthouse was ceded or only a permission to
build, maintain and operate a lighthouse was granted.

   132. The Parties do agree that Peak Rock is “the Rock” referred to in
 he last paragraph of the Governor’s letter to the Government of India
quoted in paragraph 129 above. But, Malaysia says, the consent by the
Johor authorities was not limited to that Rock alone. Rather the
responses, particularly from the Temenggong, were in general terms : the
 ighthouse might be erected near Point Romania or any spot deemed eli-
gible. The East India Company, according to Malaysia’s reading of the
correspondence, was free to choose between erecting the lighthouse near
Point Romania or anywhere else on the territory of Johor considered
suitable by the Singapore authorities for the purpose of providing guid-
ance to shipping going to or leaving Singapore. Singapore responds that
 he contents of the Governor’s letter of 28 November 1844 and its ante-
cedents indicate with certainty that the site which was the subject of his
proposal was Peak Rock.

   133. The Court is in no doubt that the proposal which the Governor
put to the Government of India related to Peak Rock. Without knowing
 he contents of the Governor’s earlier letters to the Sultan and Temeng-
gong, the Court is however left in real doubt about what the Governor
proposed. Judging from the two replies, it would appear more likely than
not that his letters were in general terms. While Peak Rock was clearly
 he site he and his advisers had in mind, the final site of the lighthouse
had yet to be decided upon. That decision was to be taken in due course
by the Government of India and the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, following such further consultation as they considered appro-
priate. And, as Singapore accepts in its Reply, the British authorities had
 n mind possible locations other than Peak Rock.


   134. Given the conclusion which the Court has already reached earlier
 n this Judgment — that Johor was sovereign over Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh in the period before the planning for and construction of the
 ighthouse began — it does not consider it need rule on Malaysia’s argu-
ment that in the 1844 correspondence the Governor acknowledged Johor’s
sovereignty over the island. That sovereignty rests on the evidence of
earlier periods which the Court has already reviewed (see in particular
paragraphs 52-69 above). The Court would note in any event that the
Malaysian contention about that acknowledgment faces the difficulty
 hat the correspondence appears to be in the most general terms, in all
 ikelihood without specifically identifying Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh.

  135. The Court accordingly turns to the second issue it identified


above (see paragraph 131) which is whether Johor ceded sovereignty over
 he particular piece of territory which the United Kingdom would select
 or the construction and operation of the lighthouse for the stated pur-
pose or granted permission only to that construction and operation. The
correspondence could not be more inconclusive. The Sultan is “exceed-
 ngly pleased at the intention expressed [by Governor Butterworth]”
because a lighthouse will allow for greater confidence ; and the Temeng-
gong had “no possible objection to” the erecting of a lighthouse ; “wish-
 ng to be guided in all matters by the Government, so much so, that the
Company are at full liberty to put up a Light House . . .”. That wording
may be read, as Malaysia would have the Court read it, as limited to a
permission to build and operate. The Sultan simply expresses pleasure
and, so far as the Temenggong is concerned, the East India Company is
at “full liberty” to put up a lighthouse.

  136. While Governor Butterworth understood that the letters
amounted to a gratuitous “cession” (see paragraph 129 above), the Court
observes that that understanding was not communicated to the Sultan
and Temenggong. Further, the Court would not give significant weight to
 he choice of just one word in the present context.

   137. The Court notes, however, that, by the time of the correspond-
ence, State practice in the South East Asian region, as beyond, recog-
nized the various legal rights and interests that could be held over land
and the associated maritime areas. The Court now gives some instances
of that recognition.
   138. Under the 1819 Agreements between Sir Stamford Raffles
and the Temenggong and the Sultan of Johor for the establishment of a
“factory” at Singapore, the East India Company agreed to pay 8,000
Spanish dollars annually so long as it maintained a “factory” on any
part of the Sultan’s hereditary dominions ; and arrangements were
made or contemplated for the government and administration of justice
over those belonging to the English factory or those settling in its
vicinity, for the protection and regulation of the Port, and for the distri-
bution of certain duties. It is apparent that the Johor authorities retain-
ed their sovereignty over all of the island of Singapore (see paragraph
21 above). Five years later, under the Crawfurd Treaty, they “ceded . . .
 n full sovereignty and property” to the East India Company the
 sland of Singapore (see paragraph 22 above). The arrangements
made in the Treaty in respect of the rights of the property held by the
Sultan and Temenggong on the island, their followers and retainers also
recognize the distinction between sovereignty and regular rights of
property. Such distinctions are recognized as well in the final article of
 he Crawfurd Treaty which “abrogate[s] and annul[s] all earlier Conven-
 ions, Treaties and Agreements” between the parties, “with the excep-
 ion of such prior conditions as have conferred on the Honourable the
English East India Company any right or title to the occupation or pos-


session of the Island of Singapore and its dependencies, as above-men-
 ioned”.
   139. The long established distinction between sovereignty and prop-
erty rights was also to be found in nineteenth century arrangements made
 n respect of lighthouses. The arrangements relating to lighthouses to
which the Court was referred related to those on Cape Rachado (1860)
and on Pulau Pisang (1885/1900) and that proposed for Pulau Aur (1901)
 not in fact constructed), all involving the Governor of the Straits Settle-
ments and the Sultan concerned. For Malaysia, the permission in those
cases, including Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, all shared a similar pat-
 ern. The Governor wrote to the authorities having sovereignty over the
envisaged territory and those authorities gave permission. Malaysia
argues that the exchanges cannot be called “informal” permissions, as
Singapore characterizes them. These lighthouse arrangements character-
 zed by Malaysia as “formalities” are the same in all four instances. They
constituted an adequate basis for the construction of lighthouses by the
United Kingdom in foreign territory. “They were not subordinated to
any other formality.” For Singapore, by contrast a sharp division is to be
made between the Rachado and Pulau Pisang cases on the one side and
 he Peak Rock and Pulau Aur cases on the other, with land grants being
obtained in the former, but informal permissions in the latter not being
 ollowed up by formal grants because the British did not proceed with
 hose two projects.


   140. The Court observes that the documentation for the Cape Rach-
ado and Pulau Pisang lighthouses is much more elaborate and precise
 han in the other cases. The first was the subject of a series of exchanges,
 ncluding a proclamation of 23 August 1860, which has a formal style in
which the Sultan of Selangor under his Royal Seal made over to the Brit-
 sh Government Cape Rachado within his territory. That grant was
matched by this reciprocal undertaking :

       “That the English Government do covenant and agree to build
     and keep a Light house for the benefit of all nations in relation to
     their ships or boats upon the said Cape Rachado (commonly called
     Tanjong Tuan) and in the event of the English Government failing
     to abide by the said agreement, then and in such case, the cession
     upon my part to be null and void.”
  141. The arrangements for Pulau Pisang consist of an agreement of
1885 between the Sultan of Johor and the Governor of the Straits Settle-
ments followed by a five page Indenture of 1900 signed, sealed and deliv-
ered by the Sultan and Governor and registered in the Johor Registry of
Deeds. The Sultan had earlier in the year, at the time of the correspon-
dence relating to Pulau Aur discussed in the next paragraph, informed
 he Governor that he would be glad to execute the necessary formal


grant, which should have been made under the terms of the 1885 Agree-
ment. The preamble to the 1900 Indenture, making the formal grant,
recalls that :

        “Whereas in or about the month of February, 1885, it was agreed
     by and between His late Highness Abu Bakar, then Maharajah of
     Johore, and the Governor of the Straits Settlements that the said
     Maharajah should grant to the Government of the Straits Settle-
     ments a plot of ground in the Island of Pulau Pisang in the Straits of
     Malacca as a site for a Lighthouse and a roadway thereto from the
     beach and that the said Government should build and effectively
     maintain a Lighthouse upon the said Island, such grant as aforesaid
     to be void if a lighthouse was not erected within a reasonable time
     from the date of such grant or if the said Government neglected
     properly to keep and maintain such lighthouse when it was built.”

The preamble then recites that the Singapore Government in pursuance
of the Agreement had built the lighthouse and had properly kept and
maintained it but no grant had been made and that it was expedient that
a grant be made. The Indenture accordingly proceeded to make the grant
and set out the conditions which, among other things, required the Gov-
ernment to use the land only for the operation of the lighthouse and
accorded the Sultan a right to repossess the land if the Government
ceased to keep the lighthouse in good order and properly managed and
worked.
   142. The Pulau Aur proposal was raised in February 1900 by the Gov-
ernment of the Straits Settlements with the Sultan of Johor with the alter-
native proposals that, as that island lay within his territory of Johor, the
Sultan would either erect a lighthouse there or permit the Straits Settle-
ments Government (if the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the leg-
 slature agreed) to take that action. The Sultan supported the second
option, and suggested that the arrangement should be the same as for the
Pulau Pisang lighthouse. That arrangement and a deed of indenture were
 n fact not concluded since the British authorities decided not to proceed
with the construction.
   143. The Court was also referred to the Convention for the Cape
Spartel lighthouse concluded in 1865 between Morocco and a number of
maritime Powers which regulates in some detail the rights and obliga-
 ions of the parties. Article I distinguishes between the Sultan’s sover-
eignty and proprietary right, on the one hand, and the direction of
administration of the lighthouse by the other parties, on the other. The
Convention was to continue in force for ten years and thereafter year by
year, subject to a right of withdrawal on notice.

 144. Against that background of extensive legal regulation in agree-
ments between the sovereign of the territory where the lighthouse was to


operate and European States, the Court observes the lack, in the case of
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, of any written agreement between the
Johor and the British authorities regulating in some detail the relation-
ship between them and their related rights and obligations. The Johor
authorities did not provide for instance for the maintenance of their sov-
ereignty and their rights to repossess the land in the event that conditions
relating to the operation of the lighthouse were not satisfied. Further,
while at the hearing before the Court the Agent of Malaysia stated that
“Malaysia has always respected the position of Singapore as operator of
Horsburgh lighthouse and I would like to place formally on record that
Malaysia will continue to do so”, Malaysia has at no time attempted to
spell out in any detail at all the rights and obligations of “Singapore as
operator”.

   145. Given the lack of a written agreement relating to the lighthouse
and the island on which it was to be constructed, the Court is not in a
position to resolve the second issue raised in paragraph 131 above about
 he content of any agreement reached in November 1844. In any event, as
will appear, what is decisive for the Court is the conduct of the authori-
 ies in Singapore (and India) and in Johor following the 1844 exchanges
of correspondence.
   146. In 1845 the choice of the site for the lighthouse was the subject of
a further exchange between Singapore and the Government of India. On
22 August 1845 Governor Butterworth, referring to earlier correspond-
ence which indicated support by the Government of India in a recom-
mendation to the Court of Directors of the East India Company for the
Peak Rock proposal, confirmed that preference and, given the number of
vessels that had been wrecked in the vicinity of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh and Point Romania, trusted that construction would soon begin
“as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount impor-
 ance”. On 15 October 1845 the Court of Directors of the Company
authorized the Governor General of India in Council to provide for the
 evying of lighthouse dues at Singapore in support of a lighthouse on
Peak Rock and in January 1846 Thomson attempted to land there to
build brick pillars to help determine the method of constructing a light-
house, but the violence of the seas prevented his landing.

  147. But later in 1846 things changed. In April of that year the Court
of Directors of the East India Company was informed that the Lords of
 he Admiralty in London were inclined to think that Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh was the best point for the lighthouse for reasons they stated.
The Government Surveyor and Captain S. Congalton, commander of the
East India Company’s steamer, the Hooghly, undertook surveys in May
and August, the latter following receipt of the letter setting out the Admi-
ralty’s opinion. In their report of 25 August they said they were “decid-
edly of opinion that Pedra Branca is the only proper position for a Light
 o be placed . . . for the safety of Shipping whether entering or departing


 or the Straits of Singapore . . .”. The following day the Governor in a
handwritten letter to the Government of India stated that the Govern-
ment “will at once perceive that Pedra Branca is the only true position”
 or the lighthouse. One word in this letter is unclear and was the subject
of opposing expert opinions submitted by each of the Parties. The dis-
puted word is either “care” or “case” and appears in the following sen-
 ence, in which the Governor stated that “the whole of the details for the
care/case of Light Houses as set forth” in his letter of 28 November 1844
relating to the proposal for a lighthouse on Peak Rock (paragraphs 129-
130 above) “will be equally applicable to the new Position”. As
mentioned, the Parties disagree on their reading of the word “care” or
“case”. Did the Governor refer to the whole of the details “for the
care” of the lighthouse or “for the case” of the lighthouse ? Singapore
supports the former reading and Malaysia the latter. For Singapore
 he word “care” carries the implication that it was only the details of
 he earlier despatch relating to the care, maintenance and operation
of the lighthouse that would apply to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh, now that it had been chosen. Malaysia, by contrast, considers
 hat the “whole of the details for the case of Light Houses” includes
 he permission granted by the Johor authorities for the construction
of the lighthouse. The Court does not find it necessary to resolve
 he clash of expert opinions on this matter. On 30 October 1846, the
President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh as the site, on 24 February 1847 the Court of Directors informed
 he Indian Government of its approval, and on 10 May 1847 the
Government of India requested Governor Butterworth to take measures
 or the construction of a lighthouse on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh according to the Plan and Estimates submitted with the letter of
28 November 1844.




  148. The Court observes that there is nothing at all in the record
before it to suggest that the authorities in Singapore considered it neces-
sary or even desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision
about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent in respect
of it. That conduct may be interpreted in one of two ways : it may
 ndicate, as Malaysia contends, that what it sees as Johor’s 1844 consent
 o the building and operation of a lighthouse on one of its islands
simply applied to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as it would have to
any of its islands. Or it may indicate, as Singapore contends, that the
Johor authorities had no rights in respect of this project and that such
was the perception in 1847 of the responsible British authorities. On
 he basis of the case file, the Court is not in a position to reach a
conclusion on that issue.



5.4.3. The construction and commissioning of Horsburgh lighthouse,
       1850-1851

   149. The facts about the construction and commissioning of the light-
house on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh — and indeed for the most
part its operation over the many years since — are not themselves the
subject of significant dispute between the Parties. They also agree on the
 aw : it “requires an intention to acquire sovereignty, a permanent inten-
 ion to do so and overt action to implement the intention and to make
 he intention to acquire manifest to other States”. There is some disagree-
ment on whether practice also requires elements of formality. Symbolic
acts accompanying the acquisition of territory are very common both
generally and in British practice. They are not however always present.
The Court does not consider that the practice demonstrates a require-
ment that there be a symbolic act. Rather the intention to acquire sov-
ereignty may appear from the conduct of the Parties, particularly con-
duct occurring over a long period.


   150. The Parties do however dispute the evaluation of the facts. Malay-
sia’s basic position is that essentially everything that the United Kingdom
and Singapore did was no more than constructing and commissioning the
 ighthouse and later operating it, within the very consent conferred by the
Sultan of Johor and the Temenggong in November 1844. They were not
actions on the basis of which Singapore could claim sovereignty over
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. There is no evidence, says Malaysia, of
a British intention to acquire sovereignty and it did not claim sovereignty
during the construction of the lighthouse at its commissioning and or at
any time during its operation. Singapore, by contrast, says that the
United Kingdom acquired title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh in the
period of 1847-1851 when it took lawful possession of the island in con-
nection with building the lighthouse on it. According to Singapore, there-
after, for over 150 years the United Kingdom and later Singapore engaged
 n the effective administration and control of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh as sovereign and not simply as the operator of the lighthouse for
over 150 years. The Court now turns to the facts.


  151. The planning for the construction and the construction itself were
n the hands of the Government Surveyor of Singapore, John Thomson,
who was appointed as Architect of the project by Governor Butterworth.
To meet the deficiency in the funds available in Singapore, the Govern-
ment of India, in agreement with the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, on 12 November 1849 authorized the preparation of a law by
Governor Butterworth imposing a duty on shipping and requested him to
 ake immediate measures to begin constructing the lighthouse. It will be
observed that the opposition to the levying of the harbour and anchorage


duties expressed in 1842 and earlier (see paragraph 127 above) was no
 onger an issue, and had not been for some years (see paragraph 146
above) ; indeed as early as 1842, when the Horsburgh lighthouse proposal
was first raised with the Government, it was contemplated that govern-
ment money would be needed (see paragraph 126 above).

   152. In December 1849 the Government Surveyor began organizing
 he construction which was to begin on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
 n late March or early April 1850 and to continue with a break over the
 ollowing monsoon season into 1851. In the course of the construction up
 o 50 workmen were to be on the island. The organization included
arranging shipping to supply the island and to protect the supplies from
pirates, the quarrying of the granite and other stone needed, and arrang-
 ng the construction and shipping of the lantern and related equipment.

   153. In February 1850 Governor Butterworth forwarded to the Gov-
ernment of India a draft Act for the levy of dues on vessels entering Sing-
apore alone (but not other ports). That statute was enacted by the Gov-
ernor-General of India in Council on 30 January 1852 and is discussed
 ater (see paragraphs 170-172 below). The Preamble to the Act recites
 hat the sums of money subscribed by private individuals were insuffi-
cient to defray the costs of the building, that the East India Company
agreed to build the lighthouse and to advance certain sums to complete it
on condition that they were repaid by a levy on ships entering Singapore
harbour, that the lighthouse had been built and it was desirable that the
expense of building it and maintaining the light should be defrayed out of
 he monies arising from the toll, and that other lights or beacons might
be established in the Straits of Malacca or nearby. The Act provided for
 he payment of the toll by ship owners and operators, the ownership and
management of the lighthouse, and the prospect of the building of
 urther lights or beacons and their operation from the toll once the
advance from the East India Company had been repaid and after the cur-
rent expenses of maintaining Horsburgh lighthouse had been met.



   154. The work had progressed to the point that on 24 May 1850,
Queen Victoria’s birthday, the foundation stone was laid. Malaysia
stresses that it was the Master of the Masonic Lodge Zetland in the East
No. 749 who with his brethren laid the stone, it was not an official gov-
ernmental occasion and there was no proclamation of British sovereignty
or any other formal act. Singapore, by contrast, emphasizes that it was
 he Governor who invited the Master and members of the Lodge to un-
dertake the task and who arranged their transport from Singapore to the
Rock. Governor Butterworth also invited the Naval Commander in
Chief of the East India Station and Thomas Church, the Resident Coun-
cillor at Singapore and Thomson’s immediate supervisor, to accompany


him. Also present, at the Governor’s invitation, were several foreign con-
suls, merchants and civil and military members of the Singapore commu-
nity. The members of the Lodge were received on Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh by the Governor who requested them to proceed with the cer-
emony which they did. The Master in his address praised the Governor,
 he merchants and mariners who had provided the nucleus of the fund,
 he East India Company for advancing the balance and James Hors-
burgh. The opening lines of the inscription on the plate gave the date by
reference to the year of the Queen’s reign, named the Governor-General,
recorded that the Foundation Stone was laid by the Master and Brethren
of the Lodge in the presence of the Governor and others and ends with
“J. T. Thomson, Architect”.


  155. The Court observes that no Johor authorities were present at the
ceremony. There is no indication that they were even invited by the Gov-
ernor to attend. That might suggest — the Court puts it no higher than
 hat — consistently with the references to the Queen and the role of the
Singapore Governor, Architect and the East India Company, that the
British and Singapore authorities did not consider it necessary to apprise
Johor of their activities on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. That they
were alert to matters of Johor sovereignty at that very time appears from
 he rejection of a proposal made by Thomson to Church later in Novem-
ber 1850. In his report of 2 November 1850 on the completion of the sea-
son’s operations on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh for the construction
of the lighthouse, which had now reached a height of 64 feet, Thomson
proposed, referring to shore support arrangements for British lighthouse
keepers and the local threat of piracy, the establishment of a station near
Point Romania. Church, in reporting to the Governor, doubted that :


     “such is absolutely necessary, or commensurate with the permanent
     expense which such an establishment must necessarily occasion.
     Romania moreover belongs to the Sovereign of Johore, where the
     British possess no legal jurisdiction ; it will of course, be necessary
     for the Steamer or Gun Boats to visit Pedro Branca weekly ; some
     benefits would also accrue by requesting His Highness the Tumon-
     gong to form a village at Romania under the control of a respectable
     Panghuloo to render assistance to the inmates of the Light House in
     a case of emergency.”
The matter was not taken any further, with Thomson communicating to
Church the following July that access to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
was not going to be closed for four or five months, as earlier supposed,
and that the establishment of a station at Point Romania was conse-
quently unnecessary.
  156. Nine days after the laying of the foundation stone on 24 May 1850


 he Temenggong of Johor did visit the rock, accompanied by 30 of his
 ollowers. Thomson referred to him as “the most powerful native chief in
 hese parts, allied to British interests. He remained at my house for two
days, employing his leisure in fishing . . .” That is the only visit by either
 he Sultan or the Temenggong and their successors recorded in the evi-
dence before the Court.

   157. The building of the lighthouse continued through the middle of
1850 until 21 October. After the monsoon, work resumed in April 1851.
On 8 July the Resident Councillor in Singapore and his party “minutely”
 nspected all the works, and during August the lantern, machinery and
apparatus arrived in Singapore and in September were hoisted to the top
of the tower which was about 95 feet high.
   158. Thomson gave this account of the final official act on Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh before the permanent lighting of Horsburgh
 ighthouse on 15 October 1851 :
       “On the 27th September, the Honorable Colonel Butterworth
     C.B., Governor of the Straits Settlements, with a party consisting of
     Sir William Jeffcott, Recorder of the Straits Settlements, Colonel
     Messitter, commanding the troops, Captain Barker, H.M.S. ‘Ama-
     zon’, Mr. Purvis and the principal merchants of Singapore, together
     with several military officers, arrived off the rock at 1 p.m. when
     they landed and minutely inspected the Pharos.”

   159. On 15 October the light was shown, as had been advertised in two
Singapore newspapers by way of a Notice to Mariners which set out the
specification of the lighthouse by “Mr. J. T. Thomson, Government Sur-
veyor” and which was signed by W. J. Butterworth as Governor. By
2 November the two gun boats had provided the lighthouse with stores
 o last until the end of March and on 17 November the Hooghly arrived
and Thomson departed on it for Singapore on 18 November 1851. He
had been on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh supervising the construction
of the lighthouse for much of the periods from April to October 1850 and
 rom April to November 1851. When the construction was underway in
 he course of those periods, supplies, especially of building materials,
were brought by the Hooghly, the two gun boats and two lighters. From
 ime to time, particularly when Thomson was needed elsewhere, for
 nstance at the quarry, his roles were taken over by his foreman, Mr. Ben-
nett.
   160. Thomson concluded his Account of the Horsburgh Lighthouse
 1852), published in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern
Asia (Vol. 6, p. 376), with an appendix “particularly [about] the measures
 aken by Government to advance the views of the promoters of this pub-
 ic work”. He mentioned the principal subscribers and said this in the
final paragraph of Appendix VII to his Account :



        “The remainder of the funds necessary to the completion of the
     Testimonial was advanced by the Government, to be repaid by a
     Light-house due on shipping. There was otherwise extensive aid
     afforded in the employment of their Steamers, gun-boats and offic-
     ers, none of the expense of which was charged against the works. I
     have already had the pleasure of mentioning the highly gratifying
     assistance of the Dutch Authorities of Rhio, in placing gun-boats as
     tenders to the operations.”

   161. Again it may be said that these actions, too, are primarily directed
at the construction of the lighthouse, but the “extensive aid” mentioned
 n the Appendix VII of Thomson’s Account quoted above may be seen as
having a sovereign character — British Government vessels made a
major contribution to the whole process of the construction of the light-
house, a contribution which was at no charge to the potential commercial
users of the light. That sovereign characterization may also be applied to
 he tablet in the Visitors Room on which is inscribed the names of
W. J. Butterworth as “Governor” and J. T. Thomson as “Architect”.
John Horsburgh is also mentioned and again reference is made to “the
enterprize of British merchants and . . . the liberal aid of the East India
Company”. As at the laying of the foundation stone, the Sultan of Johor
and Temenggong of Johor had no role. But, as also on that occasion, no
specific acts of proclamation of sovereignty, as frequently appeared in
British practice, were to be seen.


   162. The Court does not draw any conclusions about sovereignty
based on the construction and commissioning of the lighthouse. Rather it
sees those events as bearing on the issue of the evolving views of the
authorities in Johor and in Singapore about sovereignty over Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. Malaysia contends that Johor, having permit-
 ed the building of the lighthouse, had no reason to have any involvement
 n its construction and commissioning. The Court however notes that the
only time the Johor authorities were present throughout that process was
 he two-day visit of the Temenggong and his followers in early June 1850.

  163. In light of the above, the Court will now consider the conduct of
he Parties after the construction of the lighthouse on Pedra Branca/Pu-
au Batu Puteh to ascertain whether this provides a basis for concluding
hat sovereignty over the island was passed from Johor to the United
Kingdom, Singapore’s predecessor.

5.4.4. The conduct of the Parties, 1852-1952
  164. The Parties refer to activities undertaken by them and their pred-
ecessors in title between 1852 and 1980, and indeed beyond. Given the
nature of the conduct, the changing constitutional position of the Parties


and their predecessors and an exchange of correspondence in 1953 to
which the Parties have given a great deal of attention, the Court finds it
convenient to divide the conduct between events occurring before 1953
and those occurring after. The division is not precise since some conduct
runs through the whole period.

   165. At this stage it is also convenient for the Court to put to one side
as not relevant to sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh a
number of matters mentioned by Singapore but which relate essentially
 o the maintenance and operation of the lighthouse and nothing more —
 he improvement of the lighthouse, the exercise of authority over its per-
sonnel, and the collection of meteorological information (on the last mat-
 er see also paragraph 265).

  (a) Straits lights system and related British and Singapore legislation


   166. The British and Singapore legislation relating to Horsburgh light-
house and others in the region is to be seen in the broader context of the
 aw and practice relating to lighthouses and in the more specific context
of the Straits lights system. As a matter of law, a lighthouse may be built
on the territory of one State and administered by another State — with
 he consent of the first State. As a matter of fact that has happened not
 nfrequently, as instanced by the Middle East Navigation Aids Service, a
non-profit corporation registered in the United Kingdom, which owns
and administers lighthouses and other aids to navigation in Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar and elsewhere in the region, and the Cape
Spartel Treaty and the Pulau Pisang and Cape Rachado lighthouses dis-
cussed earlier in this Judgment (see paragraphs 139-143 above).

   167. As indicated, a central element in Malaysia’s argument is that
because Horsburgh lighthouse was built on an island over which Johor
was sovereign — a proposition which the Court accepts, as appears ear-
 ier in this Judgment — all the actions of the British authorities and, fol-
 owing them, the Singaporean authorities are simply actions pursued in
 he normal course of the operation of the lighthouse. Malaysia includes
among such actions the investigation of marine hazards and the pub-
 ication of notices to mariners, regulation of activities associated with the
 ighthouse, adding additional structures and facilities, permission to un-
dertake scientific and technical surveys, control of access to lighthouses
and their associated facilities, and the flying of ensigns. Singapore, by
contrast, says that some of the actions are not matters simply of the
operation of the lighthouse but are, in whole or part, acts à titre de sou-
verain. The Court considers them in following sections of this Judgment.
First, it turns its attention to the legislation, invoked by Singapore, rel-
ating to the lighthouses in the Straits area, particularly Horsburgh light-
house.


   168. Singapore, in support of its contention that it has continuously
exercised state and sovereign authority over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh, refers to legislation which it and its predecessors in title enacted
specifically relating to the island. The legislation regulated the defraying
of costs of establishing and operating the lighthouse, vesting control of it
under various governmental bodies, and regulating the activities of per-
sons residing, visiting and working on Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.
All the measures were open and notorious and drew no protests from
Malaysia.
   169. Malaysia replies that it and its predecessors had no need to
respond. The actions to which Singapore refers are yet again an aspect of
 he Straits lights system administered by Singapore, a system which
 ncluded lights which had no territorial connection with Singapore. The
system was not about sovereignty but about the maintenance and opera-
 ion of the lights system. Moreover, the legislation was about private law
matters and not about sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh
as a matter of international law. And in some respects, says Malaysia, the
enactments are a recognition by Singapore that it does not have jurisdic-
 ion over the island.


  170. Singapore refers to the Light Dues Act 1852 (India), the Light
Dues Act 1854 (India) which replaced that of 1852, the Light-Houses
Ordinance 1912 (Straits Settlements) which repealed the 1854 Act and an
amendment to it, the Light Dues Ordinance 1957 (Singapore) establish-
 ng the Singapore Light Dues Board and the Light Dues Repeal Act 1973
which transferred the assets, liabilities and employees of the Board to the
Port of Singapore Authority and repealed the 1957 ordinance.



   171. The 1852, 1854 and 1912 enactments expressly mention the light-
house at Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. They deal with property in the
 ighthouse and the 1912 measure adds “all such lighthouses as are now
established in or near to the Straits of Malacca or Singapore”. The light-
houses and appurtenances were the property of and vested in the East
India Company (1852 and 1854) and Singapore (1912). The statutes also
dealt with the management and control not only of the lighthouses but
also of the Straits lights such as that on the 2.5 fathom bank in the
Malacca Strait (1854 Act) : management and control were vested in and
maintained by the Government. The enactments are exercises of wide
 aw-making power which, it was understood, could extend to such mat-
 ers of property, management and control beyond the territories of India
and Singapore.

  172. Taken as a whole, the enactments do not, in the Court’s view,
demonstrate British sovereignty over the areas to which they apply. For


one thing the ownership provision in the 1912 ordinance applies equally
 o the lighthouses on Pulau Pisang and at Cape Rachado — both un-
doubtedly on Johor territory — as it does to that on Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh. For another, they extend to lights operating on the high seas.
And the provisions say nothing expressly about sovereignty as opposed
 o ownership and management and control, each of which they specifi-
cally regulate.

   173. Malaysia, the Court recalls, contends that the legislation supports
 ts position for two reasons. The first relates to a 1958 amendment to the
1957 Ordinance and the 1969 Light Dues Act which incorporated the
same provisions. The 1957 Ordinance required the Light Dues Board to
spend money from the fund it administered on the maintenance and
 mprovement of “navigational aids in the waters of the Colony”, defined
as “those parts of the territorial waters of the Colony which are outside
 he limits of any port”. In 1958, the definition of “waters of the colony”
was deleted and the phrase just quoted from the 1957 provision was
replaced by “lighthouses, buoys, beacons and other navigational aids in
Singapore including those at Pedra Branca (Horsburgh) and at Pulau Pis-
ang”. For Malaysia, the references to the lighthouse at Pedra Branca/Pu-
 au Batu Puteh along with that on Pulau Pisang indicate that Singapore
recognized that the former island is not part of Singapore. Singapore
replies that under the 1957 Ordinance the Board had been authorized to
spend moneys on the maintenance of navigational aids only if they were
 n the waters of the colony but not within any port. The purpose of the
amendment was to remove that limit, enabling the Board to spend mon-
eys on “lights and navigational aids within the port limits and on the
maintenance of the light at Pulau Pisang which is not within territorial
waters” (emphasis added). Further, the drafting history includes an
express statement that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is Singapore’s.



  174. In the Court’s view, the original 1957 wording is not clear in
respect of the present issue since it appears to include both lighthouses
“in Singapore” and that is wrong at least so far as Pulau Pisang is con-
cerned. The 1958 wording, by contrast, gradually expands its geographi-
cal scope, from the port of Singapore, to its approaches, and to the two
named lighthouses. The Court considers that the change, particularly
given the express reference to Pulau Pisang in the statement of purpose
and the statement that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is Singapore’s in
 he drafting history, does give support to Singapore’s contentions.


  175. Malaysia’s second reason for contending that in its legislation
Singapore recognizes that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is not within
ts sovereignty turns on the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1843, the first in


a series of Foreign Jurisdiction Acts — Acts which were invoked only at
 he oral stage of the proceedings. These statutes of the Imperial Parlia-
ment at Westminster were enacted “to remove doubts as to the exercise
of Power and Jurisdiction by Her Majesty within diverse Countries and
Places out of Her Majesty’s Dominions, and to render the same more
effectual”. Those powers and jurisdictions, the 1843 Act recites, were
conferred “by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance and any other
 awful means”. In terms of the Act and later Acts it was

     “lawful for Her Majesty to hold, exercise, and enjoy any Power or
     Jurisdiction which Her Majesty now hath or may at any Time here-
     after have within any Country or Place out of Her Majesty’s Domin-
     ions, in the same and as ample a Manner as if Her Majesty had
     acquired such Power or Jurisdiction by the Cession or Conquest of
     Territory”.
Malaysia contends that the Indian and Singapore statutes, in so far as
 hey relate to Horsburgh lighthouse, were enacted under that authority
and accordingly they recognize that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was
“out of Her Majesty’s Dominions” ; while they do not expressly refer to
 hat authority, a point made by Singapore in response, British law, says
Malaysia, does not require such reference. Singapore also argues that no
 nstrument — treaty, capitulation — of the kind referred to in the 1843
and following Acts exists.


   176. The 1843 Foreign Jurisdiction Act, the Court understands, was
particularly directed at doubts which had arisen in respect of the powers
of British consuls in the Ottoman Empire and especially about the limits
 hat might be imposed by English law on the powers, rather than about
 he existence of the powers themselves. The Court’s understanding is also
 hat the power conferred by the 1843 and later Acts was exercised, not by
an enactment of a particular colonial legislature, but by some formal
Royal instrument such as an Order in Council or Letters Patent. There is
no indication at all that the Crown delegated to the Indian or Straits Set-
 lements legislature, under the 1843 or later Acts, the powers in issue
here. Further, there is strong support for the proposition that the Act did
not extend the jurisdiction of the Crown at all ; it provided only for the
manner of exercising it. (See the authorities, including Sobhuza II v.
Miller [1926] AC 518 and Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustan Khan
 1941) LR 68 IA 109, decisions of the British Privy Council, and Nyali v.
Attorney-General [1956] 1 QB 1, a decision of the English Court of
Appeal, as well as the official Report which appears to have led to the
enactment of the 1843 Statute, conveniently gathered by Sir Kenneth Rob-
erts-Wray, Q.C., in Commonwealth and Colonial Law (1966), pp. 185-
203.)
   177. Accordingly the Court is unable to see any sufficient basis for


Malaysia’s contentions based on the 1843 Act and later Acts.

   178. The Court does however see some significance in one proposal
relating to the funding and administration of the lights. After 1912 the
duties levied on ships passing through the Straits were abolished and the
States concerned defrayed the costs of the lights on a co-operative basis.
Singapore refers to the fact that in 1913 the Chief Secretary of the Gov-
ernment of the Federated Malay States proposed an appropriation to
meet a share of the costs of the Cape Rachado Light and the One
Fathom Bank Light but not for Horsburgh lighthouse. But, as Malaysia
points out, Johor was not at that time one of those States. What is of
some significance however is that in 1952 the Director of Marine of the
Federation of Malaya of which Johor was then a part raised the question
whether the Federation should assume responsibility for the Pulau Pisang
 ighthouse, “as it is close to the coast of the Federation” but made no
such suggestion in respect of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.

   179. Singapore, when referring to legislation relating to Pedra Branca/
Pulau Batu Puteh, also cites the Protected Places Order 1991 which pro-

  184. In 1959 the Colony of Singapore was granted self government as
 he State of Singapore, comprising the territories included in the Colony
of Singapore immediately before the passing of the Act.
  185. In 1963 Singapore became part of the newly formed Federation
of Malaysia. It withdrew in 1965. The Parties agree that these changes
are of no consequence for the present proceedings.
  186. The Court considers that the various constitutional changes do
not help resolve the question of sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh. The constitutional documents refer to the island of Singa-
pore and “its dependencies” or to “all islands and places which on [a
specific date] were administered as part of [the Colony of] Singapore”.
That wording refers the Court back to the question of whether Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh may be seen as a dependency of Singapore or
administered by it. It does not assist in finding the answer to those
questions.



  187. The geographical description in the 1927 Agreement is of course
specific and it does not expressly mention Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh. Malaysia contends that that provides a significant recognition at
 hat time by Singapore that it (or the United Kingdom) did not have sov-
ereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.
  188. The Court observes that the Agreement has to be read as a whole
and in context. As its preamble says the purpose was to “retrocede”
certain of the said seas, straits and islets to Johor, that is certain of the
areas that were ceded by Johor to the East India Company in 1824,
and those areas were all within 10 miles of the main island of Singapore.
They could not have included Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh ; it
was simply not within the scope of the Agreement. Accordingly the
Court concludes that the 1927 Agreement does not assist the Malaysian
case.

  189. Malaysia also refers the Court to a Curfew Order made in Singa-
pore in 1948 in response to civil unrest in the Colony. No one was to be
 n the specified area between 6.30 p.m. and 6.30 a.m. without a police
permit. The specified area was defined in the same terms as in the
1927 Agreement, that is without including Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh. But as Singapore points out, there was no reason in terms of its
purpose for extending the ban to such a distant island anymore than
 here was for extending it to the Cocos and Christmas Islands, some great
distance away in the Indian Ocean, which at the time were part of the
Colony of Singapore.

  (c) Johor regulation of fisheries in the 1860s
   190. Malaysia contends that the Temenggong continued to control
fishing in the neighbourhood of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh after the
construction of the lighthouse, granting licences and exercising criminal
 urisdiction there, and that that exercise of authority showed the island
was Johor’s territory. The Parties refer in particular to an exchange of
correspondence between Johor and the British authorities in Singapore in
1861.
   191. The Court observes that the exchange relates in part to events
occurring within 10 miles of the island of Singapore and nothing can be
made of the fact that the Singapore authorities did not in that context
refer to jurisdiction over the waters of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh. Another incident occurred further along the Johor coast and
 nvolved Singapore fishermen returning from fishing in the neigh-
bourhood of Horsburgh lighthouse. In the Court’s opinion, on the
basis of the available records, the facts cannot be clearly established
and the wording of the Singapore reports are too vague to provide
any assistance in determining the understanding at that time by the
authorities in Singapore of sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu
Puteh.


5.4.5. The 1953 correspondence

 192. On 12 June 1953 the Colonial Secretary of Singapore wrote as
ollows to the British Adviser to the Sultan of Johor :
        “I am directed to ask for information about the rock some 40
     miles from Singapore known as Pedra Branca on which the Hors-
     burgh Lighthouse stands. The matter is relevant to the determina-
     tion of the boundaries of the Colony’s territorial waters. It appears
     this rock is outside the limits ceded by Sultan Hussain and the
     Dato Tumunggong to the East India Company with the island of
     Singapore in the Treaty of 1824 (extract at ‘A’). It was however men-
     tioned in a despatch from the Governor of Singapore on 28th Novem-
     ber 1844 (extract at ‘B’). The lighthouse was built in 1850 by the
     Colony Government who have maintained it ever since. This by
     international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on
     the Colony.

        2. In the case of Pulau Pisang which is also outside the Treaty
     limits of the colony it has been possible to trace an indenture in the
     Johore Registry of Deeds dated 6th October, 1900. This shows that
     a part of Pulau Pisang was granted to the Crown for the purposes of
     building a lighthouse. Certain conditions were attached and it is
     clear that there was no abrogation of the sovereignty of Johore. The
     status of Pisang is quite clear.
        3. It is how [now] desired to clarify the status of Pedra Branca. I
     would therefore be most grateful to know whether there is any docu-
     ment showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been
     ceded by the Government of the State of Johore or in any other way
     disposed of.
        4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Chief Secretary, Kuala
     Lumpur.”
   193. The extract from the 1824 Treaty which was attached to the letter
set out the title and Article II. Under that Article, Johor ceded the island
of Singapore to the East India Company “together with adjacent seas,
straits and islets, to the extent of ten geographical miles, from the coast of
 he said main island of Singapore” (see paragraph 102 above). The
extract from the despatch of 28 November 1844 (see paragraph 129
above), as attached, read as follows : “This Rock [i.e. Pedra Branca] is
part of a territory of the Rajah of Johore who with the Tumunggong has
willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company.”

  194. The expression “[i.e. Pedra Branca]” appeared in handwriting in
he attached typewritten copy of the extract from the 1844 despatch.
That explains why the letter of 12 June expressly says that “Pedra
Branca” was mentioned in the 1844 despatch.
  195. Later in June 1953 the Secretary to the British Adviser to the Sul-


an of Johor advised the Colonial Secretary that the Adviser had passed
he letter to the State Secretary of Johor who would

     “doubtless wish to consult with the Commissioner for Lands and
     Mines and Chief Surveyor and any existing archives before forward-
     ing the views of the State Government to the Chief Secretary”.

 196. Three months later, in a letter dated 21 September 1953, the Act-
ng State Secretary of Johor replied as follows :
       “I have the honour to refer to your letter . . . dated 12th June
     1953, addressed to the British Adviser, Johore, on the question of
     the status of Pedra Branca Rock some 40 miles from Singapore and
     to inform you that the Johore Government does not claim owner-
     ship of Pedra Branca.”
   No further correspondence followed and the Singapore authorities
 ook no public action. That was so although, as mentioned later, officials
of Singapore did consider the matter in an internal memorandum (see
paragraph 224 below).
   197. In their pleadings before the Court the Parties take sharply dif-
 erent positions on the significance of this correspondence. Malaysia
places most emphasis on the initial Singapore letter. According to Malay-
sia, the enquiry in that letter indicated the absence of any conviction on
Singapore’s part that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was part of its ter-
ritory ; it wished to clarify Singapore’s rights and obligations regarding
 he management and control of the lighthouse. The letter, Malaysia con-
 inues, “clearly references the Crawfurd Treaty of 1824 as determining
 he relevant territorial limits of Singapore, and the 1844 permission of
Johor to the building of the lighthouse”. Malaysia also calls attention to
virtually contemporaneous correspondence between Singapore officials
about territorial waters, referring to the 1824 Treaties and the 1927 Agree-
ment, as showing that the Singapore authorities had a very precise un-
derstanding of the extent of the Colony’s sovereignty, that this flowed
 rom the 1824 Treaties, and that it did not extend to Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh. Next, the reference to the position of Pulau Pisang indicates,
Malaysia says, an understanding on the part of the Colonial Secretary
 hat the management of the lighthouse was distinct from and not deter-
minative of the sovereign status on the territory on which is was
constructed.

   198. The reply from Johor, Malaysia continues, is not “a model of
clarity”. In any event it is about ownership, not about sovereignty over
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. Malaysia also contends that the Acting
State Secretary was “definitely not authorized” and did not have “the
 egal capacity to write the 1953 letter”.



   199. Finally, Malaysia calls attention to the actions of the Singapore
authorities following the receipt of the Johor letter and particularly their
 ailure to take steps to claim Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.

   200. Singapore sees the correspondence quite differently. It admits
 hat in its initial letter it was seeking information to assist it to clarify the
status of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh. The enquiry concerned the
determination of the colony’s territorial waters. The Treaties of 1824 and
 he 1927 Agreement were irrelevant to that matter. The 1844 despatch
could not be read as a showing that permission was sought from Johor to
build a lighthouse on the island. So far as the reference to Pulau Pisang
was concerned, Singapore accepts that the management of the lighthouse
and the status of the territory on which it is built can be different, but the
author of the Singapore letter was making a comparison in which he
acknowledges Johor’s sovereignty over Pulau Pisang but not over Pedra
Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.

   201. For Singapore the Johor reply is crystal clear and straightfor-
ward. In the context it is clear that ownership refers to title. Singapore
rejects Malaysia’s argument that the Acting Secretary of State of Johor
did not have authority to write the letter.
   202. The internal Singapore correspondence, after the Johor letter was
received, simply meant that Singapore could now authoritatively regard
Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as Singapore territory since Johor’s
“express disclaimer of title” had removed all doubts arising from the
 ncomplete state of the Singapore archives.

   203. The Court considers that this correspondence and its interpreta-
 ion are of central importance for determining the developing under-
standing of the two Parties about sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau
Batu Puteh. The Court gives its primary attention to those matters of
which they both had notice — the initial letter, the interim reply and the
final reply.
   204. The Singapore letter of 12 June 1953 seeks information about
“the rock” as a whole and not simply about the lighthouse. The informa-
 ion, the letter says, is relevant to the determination of the Colony’s ter-
ritorial waters, a matter, the Court observes, which is dependent on sov-
ereignty over the island.

  205. The immediately following reference to the Crawfurd Treaty
shows the same focus on sovereignty : the rock appears not to be among
 he territories ceded by the Treaty by the Sultan and Temenggong. The
apparent irrelevance of the Treaty provides one reason for seeking infor-
mation. The next sentence says that the rock was however mentioned in
 he 1844 despatch, in the extract attached to the letter. That statement is
not accurate (see paragraphs 129-132 above) but whether it is accurate or
not the Johor authorities were put on notice that in 1953 the Singapore


authorities understood, as indicated in the annotated extract from the
1844 letter which was attached (see paragraph 193 above), that their
