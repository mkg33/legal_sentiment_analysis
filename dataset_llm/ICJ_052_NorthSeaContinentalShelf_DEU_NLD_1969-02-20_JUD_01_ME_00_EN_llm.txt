18. It will be convenient to consider first the contentions put forward
on behalf of the Federal Republic. The Court does not feel able to
accept them—at least in the particular form they have taken. It considers



that, having regard both to the language of the Special Agreements and
to more general considerations of law relating to the régime of the
continental shelf, its task in the present proceedings relates essentially
to the delimitation and not the apportionment of the areas concerned,
or their division into converging sectors. Delimitation is a process which
involves establishing the boundaries of an area already, in principle,
appertaining to the coastal State and not the determination de novo of
such an area. Delimitation in an equitable manner is one thing, but not
the same thing as awarding a just and equitable share of a previously
undelimited area, even though in a number of cases the results may be
comparable, or even identical.

19. More important is the fact that the doctrine of the just and equi-
table share appears to be wholly at variance with what the Court enter-
tains no doubt is the most fundamental of all the rules of law relating
to the continental shelf, enshrined in Article 2 of the 1958 Geneva Con-
vention, though quite independent of it,—namely that the rights of the
coastal State in respect of the area of continental shelf that constitutes
a natural prolongation of its land territory into and under the sea exist
ipso facto and ab initio, by virtue of its sovereignty over the land, and
as an extension of it in an exercise of sovereign rights for the purpose
of exploring the seabe ' and exploiting its natural resources. In short,
there is here an inhere t right. In order to exercise it, no special legal
process has to be gone through, nor have any special legal acts to be
performed. Its existence can be declared (and many States have done
this) but does not need to be constituted. Furthermore, the right does
not depend on its being exercised. To echo the language of the Geneva
Convention, it is “exclusive” in the sense that if the coastal State does
not choose to explore or exploit the areas of shelf appertaining to it,
that is its own affair, but no one else may do so without its express
consent.

21. The Court will now turn to the contentions advanced on behalf
of Denmark and the Netherlands. Their general character has already
been indicated in paragraphs 13 and 14: the most convenient way of
dealing with them will be on the basis of the following question-—namely,
does the equidistance-special circumstances principle constitute a manda-
tory rule, either on a con\ ‘ational or on a customary international law
basis, in such a way as to govern any delimitation of the North Sea
continental shelf areas between the Federal Republic and the Kingdoms
of Denmark and the Netherlands respectively? Another and shorter way
of formulating the question would be to ask whether, in any delimitation
of these areas, the Federal Republic is under a legal obligation to accept
the application of the equidistance-special circumstances principle.

22. Particular attention is directed to the use, in the foregoing formula-
tions, of the terms “mandatory” and “obligation”. It has never been
doubted that the equidistance method of delimitation is a very convenient
one, the use of which is indicated in a considerable number of cases.
It constitutes a method capable of being employed in almost all circum-
stances, however singular the results might sometimes be, and has the
virtue that if necessary,—if for instance, the Parties are unable to enter
into negotiations,—any cartographer can de facto trace such a boundary
on the appropriate maps and charts, and those traced by competent
cartographers will for all practical purposes agree.

23. In short, it would probably be true to say that no other method
of delimitation has the same combination of practical convenience and
certainty of application. Yet these factors do not suffice of themselves
to convert what is a method into a rule of law, making the acceptance
of the results of using that method obligatory in all cases in which the
parties do not agree otherwise, or in which “special circumstances”
cannot be shown to exist. Juridically, if there is such a rule, it must draw
its legal force from other factors than the existence of these advantages,
important though they may be. It should also be noticed that the counter-
part of this conclusion is no less valid, and that the practical advantages
of the equidistance method would continue to exist whether its em-
ployment were obligatory or not.

24. It would however be ignoring realities if it were not noted at the
same time that the use of this method, partly for the reasons given in pa-
ragraph 8 above and partly for reasons that are best appreciated by
reference to the many maps and diagrams furnished by both sides in
the course of the written and oral proceedings, can under certain circum-
stances produce results that appear on the face of them to be extra-
ordinary, unnatural or unreasonable. It is basically this fact which un-



derlies the present proceedings. The plea that, however this may be,
the results can never be inequitable, because the equidistance principle
is by definition an equitable principle of delimitation, involves a postulate
that clearly begs the whole question at issue.

* * *

25. The Court now turns to the legal position regarding the equidis-
tance method. The first question to be considered is whether the 1958
Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf is binding for all the Parties
in this case—that is to say whether, as contended by Denmark and the
Netherlands, the use of this method is rendered obligatory for the present
delimitations by virtue of the delimitations provision (Article 6) of that
instrument, according to the conditions laid down in it. Clearly, if this
is so, then the provisions of the Convention will prevail in the relations
between the Parties, and would take precedence of any rules having a
more general character, or derived from another source. On that basis
the Court’s reply to the question put to it in the Special Agreements
would necessarily be to the effect that as between the Parties the relevant
provisions of the Convention represented the applicable rules of law—that
is to say constituted the law for the Parties—and its sole remaining task
would be to interpret those provisions, in so far as their meaning was
disputed or appeared to be uncertain, and to apply them to the particu-
lar circumstances involved.

26. The relevant provisions of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention,
paragraph 2 of which Denmark and the Netherlands contend not only to
be applicable as a conventional rule, but also to represent the accepted
rule of general international law on the subject of continental shelf
delimitation. as it exists independently of the Convention, read as follows:

“1. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories
of two or more States whose coasts are opposite each other, the
boundary of the continental shelf appertaining to such States
shall be determined by agreement between them. In the absence of
agreement, and unless another boundary line is justified by special
circumstances, the boundary is the median line, every point of which
is equidistant from the nearest point of the baselines from which
the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured.

2. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories
of two adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall
be determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agree-
ment, and unless another boundary line is justified by special circum-
stances, the boundary shall be determined by application of the
principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the baselines
from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is mea-
sured.”



The Convention received 46 signatures and, up-to-date, there have been
39 ratifications or accessions. It came into force on 10 June 1964, having
received the 22 ratifications or accessions required for that purpose
(Article 11), and was therefore in force at the time when the various
delimitations of continental shelf boundaries described earlier (para-
graphs 1 and 5) took place between the Parties. But, under the formal
provisions of the Convention, it is in force for any individual State only
in so far as, having signed it within the time-limit provided for that

that it was considered to have a different and less fundamental status
and not, like those Articles, to reflect pre-existing or emergent customary
law. It was however contended on behalf of Denmark and the Nether-
lands that the right of reservation given in respect of Article 6 was not
intended to be an unfettered right, and that in particular it does not
extend to effecting a total exclusion of the equidistance principle of
delimitation,—for, so it was claimed, delimitation on the basis of that
principle is implicit in Articles 1 and 2 of the Convention, in respect of
which no reservations are permitted. Hence the right of reservation under
Article 6 could only be exercised in a manner consistent with the preserva-
tion of at least the basic principle of equidistance. In this connection it
was pointed out that, of the no more than four reservations so far
entered in respect of Article 6, one at least of which was somewhat far-
reaching, none has purported to effect such a total exclusion or denial.

67. The Court finds this argument unconvincing for a number of
reasons. In the first place, Articles 1 and 2 of the Geneva Convention
do not appear to have any direct connection with inter-State delimitation
as such. Article 1 is concerned only with the outer, seaward, limit of
the shelf generally, not with boundaries between the shelf areas of
opposite or adjacent States. Article 2 is equally not concerned with
such boundaries. The suggestion seems to be that the notion of equidis-
tance is implicit in the reference in paragraph 2 of Article 2 to the rights
of the coastal State over its continental shelf being “exclusive”. So far as
actual language is concerned this interpretation is clearly incorrect. The
true sense of the passage is that in whatever areas of the continental
shelf a coastal State has rights, those rights are exclusive rights, not
exercisable by any other State. But this says nothing as to what in fact
are the precise areas in respect of which each coastal State possesses
these exclusive rights. This question, which can arise only as regards the
fringes of a coastal State’s shelf area is, as explained at the end of para-
graph 20 above, exactly what falls to be settled through the process of
delimitation, and this is the sphere of Article 6, not Article 2.



68. Secondly, it must be observed that no valid conclusions can be
drawn from the fact that the faculty of entering reservations to Article 6
has been exercised only sparingly and within certain limits. This is the
affair exclusively of those States which have not wished to exercise the
faculty, or which have been content to do so only to a limited extent.
Their action or inaction cannot affect the right of other States to enter
reservations to whatever is the legitimate extent of the right.

*

69. In the light of these various considerations, the Court reaches the
conclusion that the Geneva Convention did not embody or crystallize
any pre-existing or emergent rule of customary law, according to which
the delimitation of continental shelf areas between adjacent States must,
unless the Parties otherwise agree, be carried out on an equidistance-
special circumstances basis. A rule was of course embodied in Article 6
of the Convention, but as a purely conventional rule. Whether it has
since acquired a broader basis remains to be seen: gua conventional rule
however, as has already been concluded, it is not opposable to the
Federal Republic.

*
* *

70. The Court must now proceed to the last stage in the argument
put forward on behalf of Denmark and the Netherlands. This is to the
effect that even if there was at the date of the Geneva Convention no rule
of customary international law in favour of the equidistance principle,
and no such rule was crystallized in Article 6 of the Convention, never-
theless such a rule has come irito being since the Convention, partly
because of its own impact, partly on the basis of subsequent State prac-
tice,—and that this rule, being now a rule of customary international law
binding on all States, including therefore the Federal Republic, should
be declared applicable to the delimitation of the boundaries between the
Parties’ respective continental shelf areas in the North Sea.

71. In so far as this contention is based on the view that Article 6 of
the Convention has had the influence, and has produced the effect,
described, it clearly involves treating that Article as a norm-creating
provision which has constituted the foundation of, or has generated a
rule which, while only conventional or contractual in its origin, has
since passed into the general corpus of international law, and is now
accepted as such by the opinio juris, so as to have become binding even
for countries which have never, and do not, become parties to the
Convention. There is no doubt that this process is a perfectly possible
one and does from time to time occur: it constitutes indeed one of the
recognized methods by which new rules of customary international law
may be formed. At the same time this result is not lightly to be regarded
as having been attained.

72. It would in the first place be necessary that the provision con-



cerned should, at all events potentially, be of a fundamentally norm-
creating character such as could be regarded as forming the basis of a
general rule of law. Considered in abstracto the equidistance principle
might be said to fulfil this requirement. Yet in the particular form in
which it is embodied in Article 6 of the Geneva Convention, and having
regard to the relationship of that Article to other provisions of the
Convention, this must be open to some doubt. In the first place, Article 6
is so framed as to put second the obligation to make use of the equidis-
tance method, causing it to come after a primary obligation to effect
delimitation by agreement. Such a primary obligation constitutes an

delimitation of adjacent continental shelves—that is to say, rules binding
upon States for all delimitations;—ih-short, it is not a question of apply-
ing equity simply as a matter of abstract justice, but of applying a rule
of law which itself requires the application of equitable principles, in
accordance with the ideas which have always underlain the development
of the legal régime of the continental shelf in this field, namely:

(a) the parties are under an obligation to enter into negotiations with a
view to arriving at an agreement, and not merely to go through a
formal process of negotiation as a sort of prior condition for the
automatic application of a certain method of delimitation in the
absence of agreement; they are under an obligation so to conduct
themselves that the negotiations are meaningful, which will not be
the case when either of them insists upon its own position without
contemplating any modification of it;

(b) the parties are under an obligation to act in such a way that, in the
particular case, and taking all the circumstances into account,
equitable principles are applied,—for this purpose the equidistance
method can be used, but other methods exist and may be employed,
alone or in combination, according to the areas involved;

(c) for the reasons given in paragraphs 43 and 44, the continental shelf
of any State must be the natural prolongation of its land territory
and must not encroach upon what is the natural prolongation of the
territory of another State.

*
* *

86. It is now necessary to examine these rules more closely, as also
certain problems relative to their application. So far as the first rule is
concerned, the Court would recall not only that the obligation to nego-
tiate which the Parties assumed by Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Special
Agreements arises out of the Truman Proclamation, which, for the
reasons given in paragraph 47, must be considered as having propounded
the rules of law in this field, but also that this obligation merely constitutes
a special application of a principle which underlies all international
relations, and which is moreover recognized in Article 33 of the Charter
of the United Nations as one of the methods for the peaceful settlement
of international disputes. There is no need to insist upon the fundamental
character of this method of settlement, except to point out that it is
emphasized by the observable fact that judicial or arbitral settlement is
not universally accepted.

87. As the Permanent Court of International Justice said in its Order
of 19 August 1929 in the case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the
District of Gex, the judicial settlement of international disputes “is
simply an alternative to the direct and friendly settlement of such dis-
putes between the parties” (P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 22, at p. 13). Defining
the content of the obligation to negotiate, the Permanent Court, in its



Advisory Opinion in the case of Railway Traffic between Lithuania and
Poland, said that the obligation was “not only to enter into negotiations
but also to pursue them as far as possible with a view to concluding
agreements”, even if an obligation to negotiate did not imply an obliga-
tion to reach agreement (P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 42, 1931, at p. 116).
In the present case, it needs to be observed that whatever the details of
the negotiations carried on in 1965 and 1966, they failed of their purpose
because the Kingdoms of Denmark and the Netherlands, convinced
that the equidistance principle alone was applicable, in consequence of a
rule binding upon the Federal Republic, saw no reason to depart from
that rule; and equally, given the geographical considerations stated in
the last sentence of paragraph 7 above, the Federal Republic could not
accept the situation resulting from the application of that rule. So far
therefore the negotiations have not satisfied the conditions indicated in
paragraph 85 (a), but fresh negotiations are to take place on the basis
of the present Judgment.

88. The Court comes next to the rule of equity. The legal basis of that
rule in the particular case of the delimitation of the continental shelf as
between adjoining States has already been stated. It must however be
noted that the rule rests also on a broader basis. Whatever the legal
reasoning of a court of justice, its decisions must by definition be just,
and therefore in that sense equitable. Nevertheless, when mention is
made of a court dispensing justice or declaring the law, what is meant is
that the decision finds its objective justification in considerations lying
not outside but within the rules, and in this field it is precisely a rule of
law that calls for the application of equitable principles. There is con-
sequently no question in this case of any decision ex aequo et bono, such
as would only be possible under the conditions prescribed by Article 38,
paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute. Nor would this be the first time that
the Court has adopted such an attitude, as is shown by the following
passage from the Advisory Opinion given in the case of Judgments of the
Administrative Tribunal of the T.L.O. upon Complaints Made against
Unesco (I.C.J. Reports 1956, at p. 100):

“In view of this the Court need not examine the allegation that
the validity of the judgments of the Tribunal is vitiated by excess of
jurisdiction on the ground that it awarded compensation ex aequo
et bono. It will confine itself to stating that, in the reasons given by
the Tribunal in support of its decision on the merits, the Tribunal
said: ‘That redress will be ensured ex aequo et bono by the granting
to the complainant of the sum set forth below.” It does not appear
from the context of the judgment that the Tribunal thereby intended
to depart from principles of law. The apparent intention was to say



that, as the precise determination of the actual amount to be awarded

Judge Sir Muhammad ZAFRULLA KHAN makes the following declara-
tion:

I am in agreement with the Judgment throughout but would wish to
add the following observations.

The essence of the dispute between the Parties is that the two Kingdoms
claim that the delimitation effected between them under the Agreement
of 31 March 1966 is binding upon the Federal Republic and that the
Federal Republic is bound to accept the situation resulting therefrom,
which would confine its continental shelf to the triangle formed by lines
ABE and C-D-E in Map 3. The Federal Republic stoutly resists that
claim.

Not only is Article 6 of the Geneva Convention of 1958 not opposable
to the Federal Republic but the delimitation effected under the Agree-
ment of 31 March 1966 does not derive from the provisions of that Article
as Denmark and the Netherlands are neither States “whose coasts are
opposite each other” within the meaning of the first paragraph of that
Article nor are they “two adjacent States” within the meaning of the



second paragraph of that Article. The situation resulting from that delimi-
tation, so far as it affects the Federal Republic is not, therefore, brought
about by the application of the principle set out in either of the paragraphs
of Article 6 of the Convention.

Had paragraph 2 of Article 6 been applicable to the delimitation of
the continental shelf between the Parties to the dispute, a boundary line,
determined by the application of the principle of equidistance, would
have had to allow for the configuration of the coastline of the Federal
Republic as a “special circumstance”.

In the course of the oral pleadings the contention that the principle
of equidistance cum special circumstances had crystallized into a rule of
customary international law was not advanced on behalf of the two
Kingdoms as an alternative to the claim that that principle was inherent
in the very concept of the continental shelf. The Judgment has, in fair-
ness, dealt with these two contentions as if they had been put forward
in the alternative and were thus consistent with each other, and has
rejected each of them on the merits. I am in agreement with the reasoning
of the Judgment on both these points. But, I consider, it is worth men-
tioning that Counsel for the two Kingdoms summed up their position
in regard to the effect of the 1958 Convention as follows:

“... They have not maintained that the Convention embodied al-
ready received rules of customary law in the sense that the Conven-
tion was merely declaratory of existing rules. Their position is rather
that the doctrine of the coastal State’s exclusive rights over the
adjacent continental shelf was in process of formation between 1945
and 1958; that the State practice prior to 1958 showed fundamental
variations in the nature and scope of the rights claimed: that, in
consequence, in State practice the emerging doctrine was wholly
lacking in any definition of these crucial elements as it was also of
the legal régime applicable to the coastal State with respect to the
continental shelf; that the process of the definition and consolidation
of the emerging customary law took place through the work of the
International Law Commission, the reaction of governments to that
work and the proceedings of the Geneva Conference; that the
emerging customary law, now become more defined, both as to the
rights of the coastal State and the applicable régime, crystallized in
the adoption of the Continental Shelf Convention by the Conference;
and that the numerous signatures and ratifications of the Convention
and the other State practice based on the principles set out in the
Convention had the effect of consolidating those principles as cus-
tomary law.”

If it were correct that the doctrine of the coastal State’s exclusive
rights over the adjacent continental shelf was in process of formation



between 1945 and 1958 and that in State practice prior to 1958 it was
wholly lacking in any definition of crucial elements as it was also of the
legal régime applicable to the coastal State with respect to the continental
shelf, then it would seem to follow conclusively that the principle of
equidistance was not inherent in the concept of the continental shelf.

Judge BENGZON makes the following declaration:

I regret my inability to concur with the main conclusions of the
majority of the Court. T agree with my colleagues who maintain the view
that Article 6 of the Geneva Convention is the applicable international
law and that as between these Parties equidistance is the rule for delimita-
tion, which rule may even be derived from the general principles of law.
