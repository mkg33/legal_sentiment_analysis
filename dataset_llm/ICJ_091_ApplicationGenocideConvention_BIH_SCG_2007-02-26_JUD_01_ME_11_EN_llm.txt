      I. General Considerations in Respect of the Res Judicata Rule

   1. The expression res judicata has more than one meaning. It is used to
mean an issue decided by a court of law ; a judgment which cannot be
refuted by ordinary legal vehicles ; and, also, a decision which is immu-
table and irrevocable.

   The broad use of the expression res judicata could be attributed to a
certain confusion about the very quality of a judicial decision and its
effects both subjective and objective. Occasionally and especially as
regards some kinds of judgments, account is not taken of the difference
existing between irrefutability and irrevocability. If, bearing in mind the
absence of ordinary legal vehicles provided by the Statute and the Rules
of Court to a dissatisfied party for overturning the judgment, it could be
said that in general the judgments of the Court are irrefutable. It could
not however be said that they are irrevocable as well, owing not only to
the rule on revision embodied in Article 61 of the Statute, as an extraor-
dinary legal vehicle, but also due to some other judicial vehicles existing
in the law of the Court, such as the principle compétence de la com-
pétence in regard to jurisdictional issues as well as non-preliminary objec-
tions to the jurisdiction of the Court.

  2. Two components may be discerned in the substance of res judicata
as provided in the Statute of the Court :
 (i) procedural, which implies that : “The judgment is final and without
     appeal. In the event of dispute as to the meaning or scope of the
     judgment, the Court shall construe it upon the request of any party”
     (Art. 60) ; and
(ii) substantive, according to which : “The decision of the Court has no
     binding force except between the parties and in respect of that par-
     ticular case.” (Art. 59).
   3. The primary effect of res judicata in the procedural sense is claim
preclusion — meaning that a future lawsuit on the same cause of action
is precluded (non bis in idem), whereas the effect of res judicata in the
substantive sense is mainly related to the legal validity of the Court’s
decision as an individualization of objective law in the concrete matter —
pro veritate accipitur — and, also, to the exclusion of the application of
the principle of stare decisis.
   4. Two components of res judicata — procedural and substantive —
do not necessarily go hand in hand in each particular case. Each decision
of the Court — be it judgment or order — is binding upon the parties,
although not in an identical way, but such characteristic of the decision
of the Court is not necessarily followed by its finality.



                                                          uA)
   The relationship between these two components of res judicata is not
static and a priori defined because it reflects the balancing power of the
considerations underlying the procedural and substantive aspects of res
judicata rule, respectively.
   The considerations underlying the substantive aspect of res judicata
essentially protect the authority of the Court as a court of law and the
legitimacy of its decisions. Hence, it is possible to say that the binding
force of the Court’s decisions derives from the very nature of the judicial
function irrespective of the nature and content of a Court’s decision. As
the Court established in the Northern Cameroons case (I.C.J. Reports
1963, p. 38), the effect of res judicata extends also to the judgment of the
Court establishing the impossibility of changing the created legal situa-
tion.
   Underlying res judicata in the procedural sense are, in fact, considera-
tions of legal security and predictability combined with economy of the
judicial process.
   5. The distinction between characteristic of a judicial decision and its
effect derives from contrasting res judicata in its abstract normative
meaning and its application within the body of law regulating the judicial
activity of the Court, i.e. its legal meaning in casu.

   Although it is a rule of fundamental importance, forming part of the
legal system of all civilized nations, res judicata is certainly not a fetish
of, or seen as a deus ex machina by, courts of law, including the Inter-
national Court of Justice.
   The res judicata rule operates within the law that the Court applies in
parallel with other rules having an objective nature. In other words, the
res judicata rule, just like other fundamental rules governing judicial
activity of the Court, is only a part, however important it may be, of the
normative milieu in which the Court operates and which, as a whole,
determines the effect of a Court’s decision. A possible effect that the
other rules of an objective nature have upon res judicata might be sum-
marized as follows : “Finality itself . . . is rather a plastic term that need
not prohibit re-examination.” 1 It seems clear that revision in accordance
with the conditions specified in Article 61 of the Statute “constitutes
direct exception to the principle res judicata, affecting the validity of a
final judgment” 2. It is equally true that the operation of the principle of
compétence de la compétence and non-preliminary objections to the
affirmed jurisdiction of the Court may result in a reversal of one sort of
Court judgment, i.e., judgments on preliminary objections.

nals, 1953, p. 372.

   6. In that regard, none of the legal vehicles designed to challenge or
capable of use to challenge a matter already decided derogates the exist-
ence of the res judicata rule as such, for they are based on the authority
of the law which the Court applies in its totality and are made opera-
tional in the form of a binding decision by which the previous decision of
the Court is repudiated — judicum posterior derogat priori. As the effects
of res judicata attach only to decisions brought lege artis, in accordance
with the rules, procedural and substantive, of the law applied by the
Court, it could be said that the exceptions to the finality of a Court judg-
ment constitute a part of the substance of res judicata.

  Consequently, finality of the Court’s judgments within the law applied
by the Court may be relative or absolute. Only for the latter can it be said
that finality is tantamount to res judicata in terms of irrevocability.

   The judgment (sententia) and res judicata in the sense of a final and
irrevocable decision of the Court obviously are not identical notions. The
judgment as such is res judicans while res judicata est causa sinae finem
controversiae accepit.
   As a judicial act, every judgment of a court of law has a potential of res
judicata in terms of irrevocability which may be materialized or not,
depending on the outcome of procedures and weapons designed to chal-
lenge the decision of the court. So, the intrinsic quality of res judicata is,
in fact, the end point in the development of the authority which is inher-
ent in every judgment, the point in which jugement passe en force de la
chose jugée, judgment becomes enforceable.


            II. Res Judicata as Regards Jurisdictional Decisions


   7. The full effect of the res judicata rule is in principle attached to “a
final decision of an international tribunal” (Permanent Court of Arbitra-
tion (Trail Smelter case), Reports of International Arbitral Awards
(RIAA), Vol. III, pp. 1950-1951). In his separate opinion in the Fisheries
Jurisdiction case, Judge Waldock stated, “[u]nder Article 60 of the Stat-
ute the Judgment is ‘final and without appeal’. It thus constitutes a final
disposal of the case brought before the Court by the Application of
14 April 1972” (I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 125, para. 46) 3.

  However, it does not follow a contrario that the Court’s judgments
on preliminary objections are excluded from the scope of Articles 59

  3 A. V. Freeman, International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice, 1938,

p. 975 ; B. Cheng, op. cit., 1953, p. 337 ; Schwarzenberger, International Law, I, 1949,
pp. 454-455.


                                                           uA)
and 60 of the Statute of the Court. Such an interpretation would
obviously run counter to the general determination made in these
Articles.
   8. It appears that the effects of judgments on preliminary objections,
or at least some types of judgment on preliminary objections, with
respect to both their binding force and finality, are of a specific character
distinguishable to some extent from the effects of judgments on the mer-
its of the case.
   The meaning of the characterization “final” in regard to a judgment on
a preliminary objection lies solely in the fact that, after it is pronounced,
all the parties are precluded from raising any preliminary objections
whatsoever leading to revival or restitution of the preliminary objection
proceeding, as provided for in Article 79 of the Rules of Court.

  But a preliminary objection as such is not the only legal vehicle in the
body of law of the Court designed to challenge a decision of the Court.
Therefore, it is difficult to say that the judgment on the preliminary
objections raised by a party to a dispute before the Court puts a final end
to the issue of jurisdiction, so that the issue of jurisdiction can never be
raised. In the jurisprudence of the Court, and on the basis of Article 79,
paragraph 1, of the Rules, the notion of non-preliminary objection to the
jurisdiction of the Court has developed, which proves, by itself, that the
notion of objection to jurisdiction is broader than the notion of prelimi-
nary objection. The fundamental principle compétence de la compétence
may also give rise to reconsideration of the jurisdictional decision taken.


   As long as it is the functus officio in the case, the Court, as a court of
law, has the inherent power to re-open and reconsider any issue of law
and fact decided. That power would be devoid of substance if not accom-
panied by the power of the Court to reverse its earlier jurisdictional deci-
sion under special circumstances.

   9. The uncritical ascribing of immutability to every judgment is fetish-
ist and may find a model only in some long-abandoned decisions under
Langobardic law 4. Since the Roman Law (in the Roman Law the char-
acter of res judicata could be given only to final decisions in meritum 5),
the solution has been adopted that the authority of res judicata belongs,
as a rule, only to decision on the merits of a case. For instance, in French
law, decisions on incidental questions may not acquire the autorité de la
chose jugée, unless that is indispensable for the interpretation of the dis-

   4 Capitula 370 Edictum Langobardorum stipulated that an adjudicated case semper in

eadem deliberatione debeant permanere, although there existed the possibility of its rejec-
tion by a higher instance — Pugliese, Giudicato civile, Enciclopedia di diritto XVI, 1969,
p. 158.
   5 Pugliese, op. cit., p. 752 ; Kaser, Das römische Zivilprozessrecht, MCMLXVI, p. 504.




                                                          uA)
positifs of the decision in meritum or they are its “soutien nécessaire” 6.
The Italian judiciary also tends to perceive res judicata to cover the solu-
tion of the dispute which the parties submitted to the court 7. Para-
graph 322 of the German Zivilprozessrechnung (Materielle Rechtskraft)
states that only those decisions which on the demand (Anspruch) which
is stipulated in the accusation or counter-accusation may be effective.



   In English law as well, res judicata indicates the final judicial decision
adopted by the judicial tribunal competent for the causa, or the matter in
litigation 8. Also, the existence of the competent jurisdiction is considered
a condition of validity of every res judicata 9.
   Therefore, the view that the application of res judicata is objectively
limited to the issues decided by the final judicial decision is dominant in
the law of civilized nations.
   10. In that regard three types of judgments on preliminary objections
may be distinguished :
— judgments by which a preliminary objection, irrespective of its nature,
  is accepted and the dispute ipso facto ended ;
— judgments by which the objection is rejected and the Court is declared
  competent to entertain the merits of the case ; and
— judgments by which a preliminary objection raised is determined to
  be an objection which does not possess an exclusively preliminary
  character.
   The effects of res judicata such as those characterizing a judgment on
the merits of a case are possessed only by those judgments on preliminary
objections by which an objection is accepted. In contrast to the other two
remaining jurisdictional decisions, which are both constituent parts of the
pending case, this kind of jurisdictional decision puts an end to a case,
thus assuming the full effects of the res judicata rule attaching to a final
judgment in the case. There are certain differences as regards res judicata
effects between the two remaining kinds of judgments on preliminary
objections, on the one hand, and judgments on the merits, on the other.


   11. The difference in finality between jurisdictional decisions, on the
one hand, and decisions on the merits, on the other, is, in principle, quan-
titative rather than qualitative in nature. The finality of jurisdictional

                                                          uA)
decisions is more relative owing to a larger number of legal weapons by
which they can be challenged. It is reflected in the fact that a jurisdic-
tional decision may be challenged not only through revision proceeding
under Article 61 of the Statute but also in the further course of the pro-
ceedings and by a non-preliminary objection, i.e., by an objection which
is raised to the Court’s jurisdiction 10 after the preliminary objection pro-
cedure has been completed by the delivery of the judgment.
   In the practice of international courts, in particular that of the Inter-
national Court of Justice, this difference assumes qualitative proportions.
Reversal of judgments on the merits, as opposed to jurisdictional deci-
sions, is unknown in the jurisprudence of the International Court of Jus-
tice, unlike that of arbitration courts 11.

  12. The question as to whether the tribunal is irrevocably bound by its
preliminary objection judgment was raised for the first time in the
Tiedemann case (1926) before the Polish-German Mixed Arbitral Tribu-
nal.
  Sedes materiae of the matter, the Tribunal explained succinctly and
convincingly :
     “the Tribunal considers that, in the interests of legal security, it is
     important that a judgment, once rendered, should in principle be
     held to be final.
        However, the question takes on a special complexion when the
     preliminary judgment rendered is a judgment upholding the Tribu-
     nal’s jurisdiction and the latter finds subsequently, but prior to the
     judgment on the merits, that in fact it lacks jurisdiction. In such a
     case, if it were obliged to regard itself as being bound by its first deci-
     sion, it would be required to rule on a matter which it nevertheless
     acknowledges to stand outside its jurisdiction. And when — as in the
     instant case — it has in the meantime ruled that it has no jurisdiction
     in cases of the same nature, it would totally contradict itself by nev-
     ertheless ruling on the merits, and it would expose itself to the risk
     that the respondent State might take advantage of the Tribunal’s
     own acknowledgment of its lack of jurisdiction, in order to refuse to
     execute its judgment . . .
        In other words, in order to remain faithful to the res judicata prin-
     ciple, it would have to commit a manifest abuse of authority.” 12

  The principle that a court of law hearing a case which has proceeded
beyond a judgment on preliminary objections is not irrevocably bound

  10 The word “jurisdiction” is used in its generic sense comprising both general, i.e.,

locus standi in judicio, and special jurisdiction.

                                                          uA)
by that judgment has also been confirmed by the jurisprudence of the
Court.
   13. In the Nottebohm case (Preliminary Objections) the Court rejected
by its Judgment of 18 November 1953 Guatemala’s preliminary objection
to its jurisdiction and resumed proceedings on the Merits (I.C.J. Reports
1953, p. 124). Guatemala, however, raised a number of objections to
admissibility in its Counter-Memorial, in its Reply and in the course of
the oral proceedings on the merits but treated them as subsidiary to the
subject of the dispute. In its Judgment of 6 April 1955, the Court
accepted one of the objections, which related to the admissibility of
Liechtenstein’s claim given that at the time of naturalization no “genuine
link” had existed between Nottebohm and Liechtenstein (I.C.J. Reports
1955, pp. 4-65).
   The Nottebohm case can be taken as an example of reversal of the pre-
liminary objection judgment upon a non-preliminary objection raised by
the Respondent.
   14. On the other hand, the South West Africa cases (Second Phase)
illustrate the pattern of reversal of the judgment on preliminary objec-
tions by action of the Court proprio motu.
   In the preliminary objections phase (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 319), the
Court rejected four South African objections, amongst others the objec-
tion concerning the standing (locus standi) of the Applicant as well as its
interests. South Africa pointed out, inter alia, that :

        “Secondly, neither the Government of Ethiopia nor the Govern-
      ment of Liberia is ‘another Member of the League of Nations’, as
      required for locus standi by Article 7 of the Mandate for South West
      Africa ; Thirdly, . . . more particularly in that no material interests of
      the Governments of Ethiopia and/or Liberia . . . are involved therein
      or affected thereby” (ibid., p. 327).

In the merits phase the Court returned to the determination made in its
1962 Judgment and found that, in fact, the Applicants did not have
standing in the proceedings (I.C.J. Reports 1966, pp. 36-38). Namely, in
its Judgment on Preliminary Objections of 21 December 1962, the Court
established inter alia that :
         “For the manifest scope and purport of the provisions of this Arti-
      cle indicate that the Members of the League were understood to have
      a legal right or interest in the observance by the Mandatory of its
      obligations both toward the inhabitants of the Mandated Territory,
      and toward the League of Nations and its Members”,

and that :
        “Protection of the material interests of the Members or their
      nationals is of course included within its compass, but the well-being


                                                          uA)
      and development of the inhabitants of the Mandated territory are not
      less important” (South West-Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judg-
      ment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, pp. 343-344 ; emphasis added).
In essence, the Court explained the reversal of its previous finding by
describing the nature of the decision on preliminary objection. The Court
stated inter alia :
        “As regards the issue of preclusion, the Court finds it unnecessary
      to pronounce on various issues which have been raised in this con-
      nection, such as whether a decision on preliminary objection consti-
      tutes a res judicata in the proper sense of that term, whether it ranks
      as a ‘decision’ for the purposes of Article 59 of the Court’s Statute,
      or as ‘final’ within the meaning of Article 60. The essential point is
      that a decision on a preliminary objection can never be preclusive of
      a matter appertaining to the merits, whether or not it has in fact been
      dealt with in connexion with the preliminary objection.” (I.C.J.
      Reports 1966, pp. 36-37, para. 59 ; emphasis added.)
However, reasoning further about the preclusive effect of the 1962 Judg-
ment, the Court characterized — albeit indirectly — jurisdictional deci-
sions, finding that :
         “Since decisions of an interlocutory character cannot pre-judge
      questions of merits, there can be no contradiction between a decision
      allowing that the Applicants had the capacity to invoke the jurisdic-
      tional clause . . . and a decision that the Applicants have not estab-
      lished the legal basis of their claim on the merits.” (I.C.J. Reports
      1966, p. 38, para. 61 ; emphasis added.)
   In the merits phase the Court returned to the determination made in its
1962 Judgment and found that, in fact, the Applicants did not have
standing in the proceedings (I.C.J. Reports 1966, pp. 36-38).
   15. The legal basis for reconsideration of a preliminary objection judg-
ment and, possibly, a reversal of an affirmative finding on jurisdiction lies
in the inherent power of the Court to determine its own jurisdiction (the
principle of compétence de la compétence), in both its narrow and broad
meanings.
   In the narrow sense, as expressed in Article 36, paragraph 6 of the Stat-
ute, the Court takes jurisdictional decisions in cases of disputes between
the parties as regards its jurisdiction. Jurisdictional decisions of the Court
under Article 36, paragraph 6, may be of either of two types : judgments
on preliminary objection raised in accordance with Article 79 of the
Rules of Court ; and decisions taken upon non-preliminary objection.
Characteristic of decisions on non-preliminary objections is that they are
taken in phases of the proceedings other than the preliminary objection
stage, generally in the phase which should be on the merits and which is
determined in the practice of the Court to be a Judgment on jurisdiction
(Nottebohm case) or simply a Judgment in the Second Phase (South West
Africa cases). The real meaning of the last expression is in fact the second


                                                             uA)
jurisdictional phase, given that the judgment upon preliminary objection
was adopted previously.
   However, as commonly observed, the Court is bound to remain atten-
tive to the issue of jurisdiction independently from the actions of the
parties in the litigation. The Court achieves this by application of the
principle compétence de la compétence in its wider form (Nottebohm case,
I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 120) as the basis for proprio motu action of the
Court.
   “Remain attentive” as such, without proper action of the Court, has
no practical effect on the fundamental question — whether the Court has
jurisdiction in casu. The Court, bearing in mind ex officio its competence
from the moment the proceedings are begun until their end, undertakes
various decisions in that regard. Specifically, the Court’s compétence de
la compétence :
       “is not limited to verifying in each case whether the Court can deal
       with the merits . . . By extending the scope of the power in issue
       [compétence de la compétence] to all matters within the incidental
       jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has established this power as the
       most pre-preliminary function the Court undertakes.” 13
   The very seisin of the Court as a first step of a procedural nature
implies the operation of the principle compétence de la compétence by
proprio motu action of the Court. The need to resort to the principle com-
pétence de la compétence results directly from the fact that the seisin of
the Court is not the automatic consequence of the proper actions of the
parties to a dispute, and the seisin of the Court is not a pure fact but a
judicial act linked to the jurisdiction of the Court (see Nottebohm, Pre-
liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122 ; Maritime
Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain
(Qatar v. Bahrain), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1995, p. 23, para. 43).
   Without the operation of the principle compétence de la compétence as
a principle of general international law, it would be legally impossible to
establish the competence of the Court to indicate provisional measures,
for the objections to the Court’s jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 79 of
the Rules, may be submitted by the Respondent within the time-limit
fixed for the delivery of the Counter-Memorial and by a party other than
the Respondent within the time-limit fixed for the delivery of the first
pleading. The operation of the principle in this case results in the judicial
presumption on proper jurisdiction of the Court in the form of “prima
facie jurisdiction” (Legality of Use of Force, Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 ; separate opinion of Judge Krecua,
para. 12 ; emphasis added).
   16. The special position of a judgment on preliminary objection exists

  13   Shihata, op. cit., pp. 41-42 ; emphasis added.


                                                           uA)
in respect of both aspects of the res judicata rule — its binding force and
finality.
   A perception of distinct relativity of a jurisdictional decision of the
Court pervades the body of law regulating the Court’s activity. The rules
regarding preliminary objections are grouped in Subsection 2 of Sec-
tion D of the Rules of Court, entitled “Incidental Proceedings”. Such
placement of the rules on preliminary objections suggests, as the Court
stated in the South West Africa cases (Second Phase) (I.C.J. Reports
1966, p. 38, para. 61), that judgment on a preliminary objection is “of an
interlocutory character”, which implies a provisional, rather than final,
character. Furthermore, Article 79, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court,
providing that “[a]ny objection . . . to the jurisdiction of the Court or to
the admissibility . . . or other objection the decision upon which is
requested before any further proceedings on the merits” (emphasis added),
per se expresses the relative finality of a judgment on preliminary objec-
tions. Preliminary objections as such do not, however, exhaust objections
to the jurisdiction of the Court. As early as the 1980s, the jurisprudence
of the Court, supported by State practice, developed to the effect that the
formal preliminary objection procedure is not exhaustive of the matter 14,
as well as that non-preliminary objections to jurisdiction are also capable
of reversing a judgment on preliminary objections as demonstrated in the
Nottebohm case. Non-preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the
Court give rise to application of the principle of compétence de la com-
pétence understood, as I have noted before (Legality of Use of Force
(Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2004, paras. 43-50), in the narrow sense.



   Finally, the principle of compétence de la compétence understood in a
general sense can be seen in the Resolution Concerning the Internal Judi-
cial Practice of the Court in its provision stating that “the Court may pro-
ceed to entertain the merits of the case or, if that stage has already been
reached, on the global question of whether, finally, the Court is competent
or the claim admissible” (Art. 8 (ii) (b) ; emphasis added). It seems clear
that the “global question” is “one which would normally arise only after
all the previous questions and the merits have been pleaded (that is to
say, the substance of any particular phase [has] thus been decided”) 15.

  17. With regard to the binding force of a judgment on preliminary
objections, it seems clear that it does not create legal obligations stricto

sensu which parties in the proceedings are required to comply with. The
party that raised a preliminary objection rejected by the Court does not
suffer any legal consequences if, for instance, it decides not to participate
in the proceedings for which the Court declared itself competent. An
affirmative judgment in the preliminary objection procedure creates for
that party a processual burden rather than a legal duty stricto sensu.
Moreover, the Applicant has no legal obligation to proceed to plead the
claim either. While an affirmative jurisdictional decision creates a pro-
cessual burden for the Respondent, vis-à-vis the Applicant it constitutes a
pure processual entitlement which the Applicant uses with absolute dis-
cretion (discretio legalis) without suffering any sanctions in proceedings
of failure to comply with the letter of affirmative jurisdictional decisions.

   In fact, an affirmative judgment in the preliminary objections phase
creates a duty for the Court only to proceed to the merits phase, but judi-
cial action by the Court in that regard is dependent upon proper actions
by the parties to a case.
   In contrast to a jurisdictional judgment, a judgment on the merits of a
case possesses binding effect in terms of creating legal duties for the
parties, so that “neither party can by unilateral means free itself from its
obligation under international law to carry out the judgment in good
faith” 16.
   18. The more relative character of jurisdictional decisions of the Court
as compared with the finality of a judgment on the merits of the case is
justified on a number of grounds.
   Jurisdictional issues are not, as a rule, core issues of cases before the
Court, nor are they the raison d’être of recourse to the Court by the
parties to a dispute. Cases, such as the Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
of the ICAO Council (I.C.J. Reports 1972), in which the Court acts as a
court of appeal, are the only exceptions.

   The parties to a dispute turn to the Court to protect a subjective right
or interest in the sense of substantive law, not because of the issue of
jurisdiction as such. An affirmative judgment on jurisdictional issues
establishes only the necessary prerequisite for resolving the main issue
and it concerns substantive law in terms of conferring or imposing upon
the parties a legal right or obligation of a positive or negative nature. In
this sense, a judgment on jurisdictional issues is of

      “a purely declaratory nature and it can never create a right i.e.,
      bestow on the Court itself a jurisdiction which is not supported by
      applicable rules of law either general or particular” (Certain German
      Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 6, 1925,

   16 Société Commerciale de Belgique, Judgment, 1939, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 78,

p. 176.


                                                          uA)
      P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, dissenting opinion of Judge Rostworowski,
      p. 32).

In other words, a judgment on jurisdictional issues is adjective rather
than substantive in its nature and, consequently, in its effects as well.
It does not create a new legal situation in terms of substantive law nor
gives an order to perform an act as it does not state how the law
disputed between the parties is to be applied. (For classification of inter-
national judgments, see Encyclopedia of Public International Law, III,
1997, pp. 33-34.)

   The reversal by a court of law acting within its judicial prerogatives of
the jurisdictional judgment in a pending case does not substantially, if at
all, affect stability and predictability as the rationale of finality of the
judgment, as advocated by the majority (Judgment, para. 116). This is
because the subject matter here is not substantive rights and obligations
of the parties. As an affirmative jurisdictional decision merely confers
entitlement to have a claim entertained and decided by the court, it is
hard to say that its reversal may result in disturbing jural relations under
substantive law. The only disturbance that can be spoken of in case of a
reversal of an affirmative jurisdictional decision is the disturbance in the
processual relationship established by the jurisdictional decision, distur-
bance which is a matter of the subjective expectations of the parties to a
dispute rather than a matter of public policy underlying the finality of the
Court’s decision.



   On the contrary, if, after adopting a jurisdictional decision and before
handing down its judgment on the merits, the Court found that its deci-
sion was erroneous for any reason, it would commit a manifest abuse of
its power if it were to abide by the res judicata rule. Thus, rather than
strengthening the res judicata rule, insistence on the finality of jurisdic-
tional decisions in all circumstances would be to its detriment, paralyz-
ing, and even nullifying, the activity of the Court as a court of law and
justice, for, besides the intrinsic, constituent elements of the res judicata
rule, there exists the fundamental extrinsic condition, the requisite valid-
ity of the Court’s decision in terms of substantive and procedural law.


  Finally, the more relative character of jurisdictional decisions, as
regards finality, results or may result from the operation of the principle
of compétence de la compétence. Specifically, the principle of compétence
de la compétence operates exclusively in respect of jurisdictional issues.

   19. In practical terms, the relativity of jurisdictional decisions, espe-
cially judgments on preliminary objections as a formal type of jurisdic-


                                                          uA)
tional decision might result from balancing two considerations which
differ by nature :
(i) special circumstances forming an objective element deriving from
    legality which dictate reversal of the jurisdictional decision ; and

(ii) a subjective element, which implies the readiness of a court of law to
     address the matter.
   As regards this element, while somewhat pathetic, the warning is essen-
tially correct that the “future of international adjudication, if not global
peace, may paradoxically depend on the capacity of our supreme judicial
organ to say mea culpa” 17.


      III. Application of the Res Judicata Rule to the 1996 Judgment
  20. The position taken by the majority on the application of res judi-
cata to the 1996 Judgment of the Court suffers from two basic weak-
nesses :
(a) a narrow and fetishist perception of the res judicata rule ;
(b) an erroneous assessment of the relevant conditions for its applica-
    tion in casu.
  As a consequence, it can be said that the perception of the res judicata
rule as well as its application to the 1996 Judgment is completely misguided.

1. Perception of the res judicata rule
  21. The dual, organically linked, structure of the res judicata rule as
designed in Articles 59 and 60 of the Statute has been reduced by the
majority to only one element — its binding force, although the crucial
question in the case at hand is, in fact, the finality of the 1996 Judgment.
In that regard, it is said that the “Statute . . . declares, in Article 60, the
res judicata principle without exception” (Judgment, para. 119).

  The essence of the perception can be expressed as follows :
        “Article 59 of the Statute, notwithstanding its negative wording,
      has as its core the positive statement that the parties are bound by the
      decision of the Court in respect of the particular case. Article 60 of
      the Statute provides that the judgment is final and without appeal ;
      Article 61 places close limits of time and substance on the ability of
      the parties to seek the revision of the judgment.” (Judgment,
      para. 115 ; emphasis added.)

Grounds of Nullity in the Decision of 18 July 1966 and Methods of Revision”, The Vir-
ginia Journal of International Law, 1966, Vol. 7, No. 1, p. 4.


                                                           uA)
This reasoning seems to confuse the characteristics and effects of the res
judicata rule.
   The binding force of the Court’s decision most certainly constitutes its
substantive aspect. But, such a characteristic of the decision of the Court
does not necessarily imply its finality, which is a matter of the procedural
effects of the Court’s decision.
   In fact, each decision of the Court, being a proper expression of the
judicial power, possesses binding force. In the formula auctoritas res judi-
cata or l’autorité de la chose jugée, auctoritas does not per se mean final-
ity, but rather the specific weight or credit of a judicial decision serving as
a basis for its finality. Finality is never an attribute of the auctoritas itself.
It may be the attribute of the auctoritas of the judgment after exhausting
legal avenues, either regular or extraordinary, by which the judgment can
be challenged.

   22. According to the majority view, the 1996 Judgment is considered
final, for
      “[t]he Statute provides for only one procedure in such an event : the
      procedure under Article 61, which offers the possibility for the revi-
      sion of judgments . . .” (Judgment, para. 120),
and, furthermore,
         “Subject only to this possibility of revision, the applicable princi-
      ple is res judicata pro veritate habetur, that is to say that the findings
      of a judgment are, for the purposes of the case and between the
      parties, to be taken as correct, and may not be reopened on the basis
      of claims that doubt has been thrown on them by subsequent events.”
      (Judgment, para. 120 ; emphasis added.)

   Such a perception of the finality of a judgment seems too narrow,
because it obviously does not take into account all legal vehicles avail-
able, either to the parties or to the Court itself, for the purpose of recon-
sideration of the issue of jurisdiction. The law of the Court knows, in
addition to revision under Article 61 of the Statute, two legal vehicles
which are relevant in that regard. As stated above, these are the principle
of compétence de la compétence in terms of both Article 36, paragraph 5,
of the Statute and the rule of general international law (Nottebohm, Pre-
liminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, pp. 119-120) and
non-preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court.
   23. The principle compétence de la compétence is “indispensably nec-
essary to the discharge of any . . . duties” 18 of any judicial authority.
Although, in contrast to jurisdictional objections raised by the parties, it

national Adjudications, Ancient and Modern History and Documents, Modern Series,
Vol. IV, p. 183.


                                                          uA)
is not specifically designed to challenge the jurisdiction of the Court, its
operation, either proprio motu or upon an objection by a party, always
affects, positively or negatively, the jurisdiction of the Court.

   The power of the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction, ema-
nating from the principle of compétence de la compétence, is an inherent
right and duty of the Court and it knows no bounds (Electricity Com-
pany of Sofia and Bulgaria, Judgment, 1939, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 77,
dissenting opinion of Judge Urrutia, pp. 102-103). The Court exercises its
inherent power from beginning to end of the proceedings with a view to
establishing whether it possesses jurisdiction or not in the particular case.
In reality, the Court exercises its inherent power in two ways :
(a) by taking a quiet, informal decision as to the existence of the proc-
    essual requirements for jurisdiction through prima facie assessment,
    this being substantively a judicial presumption of jurisdiction ; and

(b) by adopting a formal decision on jurisdiction.
   In that sense, the Court’s power to determine whether it has jurisdic-
tion in a given case seems absolute, considering that the Court, even if it
declares that it has no jurisdiction in casu, exercises that inherent power.

   24. Accordingly, the exercise of that power cannot be limited ratione
temporis as long as the Court is functus officio in the case. Inherent in the
power of the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction ad casum is
the proper right to reopen and reconsider the issue of jurisdiction, either
proprio motu or upon jurisdictional objection by a party to a dispute, as
clearly demonstrated in the Nottebohm case (para. 13 above) and the
South West Africa cases (para. 14 above).

   This, of course, does not mean, as the Judgment correctly stated, that
“jurisdictional decisions remain reviewable indefinitely . . .” (Judgment,
para. 118).
   There exist clear limits, both temporal and substantive, within which
jurisdictional decisions are reviewable. As regards temporal limits, the
jurisdictional decision is reviewable until the Court is functus officio in a
given case, whereas substantive limits concern the nature of the circum-
stances which justify reconsideration. They must be of a special nature
affecting legality as the primary value and ultimate purpose of judicial
decisions of any court of law, for

         “The Commission is a tribunal sitting continuously with all the
      attributes and functions of a continuing tribunal until its work shall
      have been closed. Where the Commission has misinterpreted the evi-
      dence, or made a mistake in calculation, or where its decision does
      not follow its fact findings, or where in any other respect the decision


                                                          uA)
      does not comport with the record as made, or where the decision
      involves a material error of law, the Commission not only has
      power, but is under the duty, upon a proper showing, to re-open and
      correct a decision to accord with the facts and the applicable legal
      rules.” (Mixed Claims Commission — United States of America and
      Germany, AJIL, 1940, Vol. 34, No. 1, p. 154.)

   Such inherent power and, even, a duty emanate from the very nature
of the judicial function, for, as Commissioner Owen Roberts stated, “No
tribunal worthy of its name or of any respect may allow its decision to
stand if such allegations are well-founded” (ibid., p. 164).

  25. The unjustifiably narrow interpretation of the res judicata rule
inevitably leads to a striking conclusion that
         “Subject only to [the] possibility of revision, the applicable prin-
      ciple is res judicata pro veritate habetur, that is to say that the find-
      ings of a judgment are, for the purposes of the case and between the
      parties, to be taken as correct, and may not be reopened on the basis
      of claims that doubt has been thrown on them by subsequent events.”
      (Judgment, para. 120 ; emphasis added.)

  Considering the Court’s findings to be immutable even in the face of
subsequent events throwing doubt on their veracity, the majority view
neglects the aspect of legality in the substance of the res judicata rule.

   As subsequent events can hardly be considered as “a new fact” under
Article 61 of the Statute, it appears that the Court as a rule takes deci-
sions ex jure proprio, independently of international law, so that the legal
situation determined by the Court is, ex definitione, the true position
under international law.
   Such a view can only be seen as judicial extremism, which cannot but
be conducive to absurd results. A good illustration in that regard is pre-
cisely this particular case.
   If the findings of the Court are to be taken as correct, whatever doubt
may be thrown on them by subsequent events, the conclusion that fol-
lows is that the Respondent State in the case at hand is the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia because the Court so decided in its 1996 Judg-
ment, which, according to the finding by the majority of the Court, is res
judicata.
   26. A non-preliminary objection, as a vehicle for challenging a judg-
ment on preliminary objections, brings into play the principle of com-
pétence de la compétence in accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 36 of
the Statute.
   That is exactly what happened in the present case.
   In May 2001, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia submitted a docu-


                                                          uA)
ment entitled “Initiative to the Court to Reconsider Ex Officio Jurisdic-
tion over Yugoslavia”, requesting the Court to adjudge and declare that
it had no jurisdiction ratione personae over it. The request was based on
the argument that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had not been a
party to the Statute of the Court until its admission to the United
Nations on 1 November 2000 and that it had not been a party to the
Genocide Convention (Judgment, para. 26). In addition, Yugoslavia
asked the Court to suspend the proceedings on the merits until the deci-
sion on the Initiative was rendered (ibid.).

   In a letter of 3 December 2001, Bosnia and Herzegovina requested the
Court, inter alia, to “respond in the negative to the request embodied in
the ‘Initiative’” (Judgment, para. 28).
   Acting on this matter, the Court decided, as shown by a letter from the
Registrar dated 12 June 2003, that it could not effect a suspension of the
proceedings.
   As regards the issue of reconsideration by the Court of its jurisdiction
in the case, it was stated inter alia :
         “The Court . . . as was in fact observed by Serbia and Montenegro
      in the ‘Initiative’ document, and as the Court has emphasized in the
      past, is entitled to consider jurisdictional issues proprio motu, and
      must ‘always be satisfied that it has jurisdiction’ (Appeal Relating to
      the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council, I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 52). It
      goes without saying that the Court will not give judgment on the mer-
      its of the present case unless it is satisfied that it has jurisdiction.
      Should Serbia and Montenegro wish to present further argument to
      the Court on jurisdictional questions during the oral proceedings on
      the merits, it will be free to do so.” (Letter of 12 June 2003 ; emphasis
      added.)
   In a word, the view of the majority that “[s]ubject only to [the] possi-
bility of revision, the applicable principle is res judicata pro veritate
habetur . . .” (Judgment, para. 120) seems to run contra factum proprium.


2. Erroneous assessment of the relevant conditions for its application in
   casu

   27. The conditions for the application of the res judicata rule can be
divided into two categories : intrinsic and extrinsic. As regards the intrin-
sic one, according to the classic formula, res judicata applies only where
there is an identity of parties (eadem personae) and an identity of the
question at issue (eadem res). The latter element is sometimes divided
into the object (petitum) and the grounds advanced (causa petendi), for
example, Interpretation of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (Factory at Chorzów),
Judgment No. 11, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 13, dissenting opinion of


                                                         uA)
Judge Anzilotti, p. 23 ; Polish Postal Service in Danzig, Advisory Opin-
ion, 1925, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 11, p. 30.
   The extrinsic condition for applying the res judicata rule, assuming the
intrinsic elements are present, is the validity of the judgment. In the
Effect of Awards of Compensation Made by the United Nations Adminis-
trative Tribunal case, the Court clearly set out the requirement of validity
by construing the question put to it by the General Assembly as referring
“only to awards of compensation made by the Administrative Tribunal,
properly constituted and acting within the limits of its statutory compe-
tence” (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 55).

   28. The “Long March” on the part of the majority of the Court
through the issue of the Respondent’s jus standi, ended, after almost
14 years, by its adoption of a third successive position, a position sharing
a negative characteristic with the preceding two. That is to say, it has not
provided any answer to the question which is the sedes materiae of the
jurisdictional complex in the present case, whether the Respondent,
under Article 35 of the Statute of the Court, possesses the right to appear
before the Court or not.
   The Court’s first position, embodied in the 1996 Judgment, could be
characterized as that of clearly avoiding the question. The majority sim-
ply closed their eyes to the relevant issue, as if it did not exist at all. A
characteristic feature of the second position, elaborated in the Judgment
in Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case
concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia),
Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina) (Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 7), is the attempt to construct a sui generis
position of the Respondent vis-à-vis the United Nations in the period
1992-2000. It is some type of explanation for the tacit treatment of the
Respondent as a State having jus standi before the Court. In the present
Judgment, the majority has formulated a third position, one that can be
described, from the substantive point of view, as a return to a modified
avoidance position. Specifically, the third position accepts the incontest-
able fact that the Respondent was admitted, by decision of the competent
political organs of the United Nations, to membership of the world
Organization on 1 November 2000 (Judgment, para. 99) as a new Mem-
ber, but it avoids accepting the necessary consequences of that fact as
regards the Respondent’s jus standi relying on an erroneous perception of
the res judicata rule.


  However, in another dispute in which Serbia and Montenegro was
involved, namely, the Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court decided
that the act of admission of Serbia and Montenegro to United Nations
membership was determinative as regards jus standi.



                                                           uA)
  This sharp contradiction in determining the legal consequences of the
admission of Serbia and Montenegro as regards its jus standi before the
Court perhaps vindicates, Honoré de Balzac’s cynicism in observing that :
“Les lois sont des toiles d’araignées à travers lesquelles passent les grosses
mouches et où restent les petites.” 19

   29. The issue of jus standi deserves a more detailed elaboration due to
its crucial importance in the present case.


3. Jus standi 20 as an autonomous processual condition
   30. Jus standi, in relation to jurisdiction understood in the standard
sense to be the Court’s power to solve concrete disputes, is an autono-
mous and separate processual condition. Substantively, it means a gen-
eral, potential right of a State entitling it, under the additional proviso of
the existence of a proper jurisdictional instrument, to participate in a case
before the Court in the capacity of a party, either as an Applicant or as
a Respondent, or as an intervening party. As such, jus standi is a general,
positive processual condition. It is materialized if a State possessing jus
standi brings legal action, has an action brought against it, or, in accord-
ance with the relevant rules of the Court, intervenes in proceedings pend-
ing before the Court. Being autonomous, jus standi belongs to a State
even if the State is not a party to the dispute or a party to the proceedings
pending before the Court.


  There is no direct, organic link between jus standi before the Court and
the jurisdiction of the Court. As the Court stated in the South West
Africa cases (Second Phase) :
        “It is a universal and necessary, but yet almost elementary princi-
      ple of procedural law that a distinction has to be made between . . .
      the right to activate a court and the right of the court to examine the
      merits of the claim.” (South West Africa, Second Phase, Judgment,
      I.C.J. Reports 1966, p. 39, para. 64 ; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal
      Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judg-
      ment, I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 53, para. 11 ; emphasis added.)
   Accordingly, the Court does not acquire jurisdiction in the concrete
dispute eo ipso, simply because the parties to the dispute possess jus
standi before the Court, just as vice versa the existence of a proper juris-

   19 Honoré de Balzac, La Maison Nucingen (http://www.citationspolitiques.com/

recherche.php3 ?rechercheLes+lois+sont+des+toiles+d92araignE9es).
   20 The expression “locus standi” or “locus standi in judicio” is usually used. However

the expression “jus standi” appears to be more appropriate since it directly addresses the
right established by Article 35 of the Statute. The expression “locus standi” is used when
it is, as such, employed in the jurisprudence of the Court.


                                                           uA)
dictional instrument in force between the parties to the dispute does not
imply jus standi of the parties to the dispute before the Court.
   31. In relation to the issue of jurisdiction, jus standi is antecedent in
nature, being a pre-condition for the establishment of the Court’s juris-
diction in casu. In the absence of jus standi of a State (or States) in the
dispute, it is legally impossible for the Court to establish its jurisdiction,
for “only those States which have access to the Court can confer jurisdic-
tion upon it” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v.
Netherlands), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004,
p. 1030, para. 45). Moreover, in such a case the Court would not be
authorized either to take into consideration the issue of its jurisdiction or
to take any judicial action of a substantive nature.
   Not only is a State, without jus standi precluded from being a party in
the proceedings before the Court, but the Court cannot stricti juris even
have any dealings with such a State in the judicial, as opposed to admin-
istrative, sphere. The Court cannot have recourse to the exercise of the
power, vis-à-vis such a State, of determining its jurisdiction (compétence
de la compétence), nor can it indicate provisional measures of protection
or exercise any of the powers inherent in the judicial function.
   Consequently actions of the Court, with the exception of those aimed
at establishing the jus standi of a State to a dispute are not legally
founded in the law of the Court. It could not even be said of any such
actions that they had been taken ultra vires, because the effect of ultra
vires implies a measure of judicial vires which the Court, has exceeded in
the concrete case, but rather the legally non-existent, factual actions had
been taken sine vires.
   Accordingly, the absence of jus standi would be a reason for the abso-
lute nullity of Court actions purporting to be judicial in nature.

  3.1. Legal force of the jus standi rule
  32. Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute is of a constitutional nature,
an integral part of the public order established by the Charter of the
United Nations. As such, together with other provisions of the Statute of
such a nature, it represents a jus cogens 21, incapable of any modification
even by the Court itself. Therefore,

         “The function of the Court to enquire into the matter and reach
      its own conclusion is thus mandatory upon the Court irrespective of
      the consent of the parties and is in no way incompatible with the
      principle that the jurisdiction of the Court depends on consent.”

      para. 35.)
Article 35 of the Statute provides :
        “(1) The Court shall be open to the States parties to the present
      Statute.
          (2) The conditions under which the Court shall be open to other
      States shall, subject to the special provisions contained in treaties in
      force, be laid down by the Security Council, but in no case shall such
      conditions place the parties in a position of inequality before the
      Court.” (Emphasis added.)
   The imperative form of the provisions of Article 35, paragraphs 1 and
2, of the Statute carries with it a dual — permissive and prohibitive —
meaning.
   On the one hand, the provisions authorize a party to the Statute — and
a State not party to the Statute, on the condition that it accept the gen-
eral jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with Security Council resolu-
tion 9 (1946) — to gain access to the Court. On the other, they prohibit
access to the Court by a non-party to the Statute which has not accepted
the general jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to Security Council resolu-
tion 9 (1946).
   The combined effects of Article 35, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Statute
together with Article 34, paragraph 1, of the Statute express the limited
nature of the right to judicial protection before the International Court
of Justice.
   The limited right to judicial protection before the International Court
of Justice is part of the public order of the Organization of the United
Nations, whose principal judicial organ is the Court. In Article 93 (1) and
(2) the Charter provides :
        “(1) All Members of the United Nations are ipso facto parties to
      the Statute of the International Court of Justice.
          (2) A State which is not a Member of the United Nations may
      become a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice
      on conditions to be determined in each case by the General Assem-
      bly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.”
This should be read in conjunction with Articles 34 (1) and 35 (1) and (2)
of the Statute of the Court, which is itself “an integral part of the present
Charter” (Art. 92 of the Charter).
   As such, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 35 of the Statute are mandatory
and the Court is bound to apply them ex officio. In respect
of the temporal element in the application of the rules, given the
antecedent nature of jus standi, the Court is under an obligation to
establish the jus standi of the parties to the dispute before any
proceedings whatsoever, and to take account of it throughout the
entire proceedings. For instance, it is possible that a party in the


                                                          uA)
case before the Court ceases to exist as a State in the course of the
proceedings.
  33. A proper pattern of ex lege reasoning of the Court, in the other-
wise modest jurisprudence of the Court relating to jus standi, is offered
by the Judgment in the Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Ger-
many v. Iceland) case :

      “the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland seemed to suggest that
      the timing of the declaration of the Federal Republic of Germany of
      29 October 1971, deposited with the Registrar on 22 November
      1971, may have had some effect on the binding force of the agree-
      ment contained in the Exchange of Notes of 19 July 1961 or on the
      right of access to the Court of the Federal Republic of Germany. As
      to the first point, it is clear that the binding force of the agreement
      between the two Governments, which is to be examined in the
      present Judgment, bears no relation to the date on which the declara-
      tion required by the Security Council resolution of 15 October 1946
      was deposited with the Registrar : the former is designed to establish
      the jurisdiction of the Court over a particular kind of dispute ; the
      latter provides for access to the Court of States which are not parties
      to the Statue. As to the second point (i.e., the question of the Federal
      Republic’s right of access to the Court), according to the Security
      Council resolution, a declaration, which may be either particular or
      general, must be filed by the State which is not a party to the Statute,
      previously to its appearance before the Court. This was done.” (Juris-
      diction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 53, para. 11 ;
      emphasis added.)


The pattern was followed by the Court in the Legality of Use of Force
cases as well :

      “the question whether Serbia and Montenegro was or was not a
      party to the Statute of the Court at the time of the institution of the
      present proceedings is fundamental ; for if it were not such a party,
      the Court would not be open to it under Article 35, paragraph 1, of
      the Statute. In that situation, subject to any application of para-
      graph 2 of that Article, Serbia and Montenegro could not have prop-
      erly seised the Court, whatever title of jurisdiction it might have
      invoked, for the simple reason that Serbia and Montenegro did not
      have the right to appear before the Court.
         The Court can exercise its judicial function only in respect of
      those States which have access to it under Article 35 of the Statute.
      And only those States which have access to the Court can confer
      jurisdiction upon it.” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Mon-
      tenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
      Reports 2004, p. 299, para. 46 ; emphasis added.)


                                                          uA)
  3.2. Differentia specifica between jus standi and jurisdiction of the
       Court ratione personae

   34. Both notions — jus standi and jurisdiction ratione personae —
share the characteristic of belonging to the corpus of processual condi-
tions necessary for the validity of proceedings — whether incidental or
on the merits — before the Court and with respect to the reference of
disputes to the Court for decision. They also share the attribute of being
absolute processual conditions that must be satisfied in every case and
both are positive requirements in that, if they are not satisfied, the Court
cannot entertain the claims made.

   35. The differences between them, however, are considerably greater,
making them distinct processual conditions. Primo, they reflect the dif-
ferent aspects of the legal nature of the Court. While jurisdiction ratione
personae, as one of the relevant aspects of jurisdiction, expresses the con-
sensual nature of the Court’s jurisdiction, jus standi derives from the fact
that the International Court of Justice, in contrast to arbitration courts,
is not a fully open court of law. Access to the Court is limited in two
respects on the basis of Articles 34, paragraph 1, and Article 35, para-
graphs 1 and 2, of the Statute of the Court. Tertio, although both juris-
diction ratione personae and jus standi are regulated by the rules of the
Statute having an objective, constitutional character, there exists a fun-
damental difference in the application of these rules. The rules of the
Statute which concern jus standi are applied by the Court ex lege, while
the corresponding rules concerning jurisdiction ratione personae are
applied on the basis of the consent of the States to the dispute. In its
Judgments in the Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court stated, inter
alia, that

      “a question of jurisdiction . . . relates to the consent of a party and
      the question of the right of a party to appear before the Court under
      the requirements of the Statute, which is not a matter of consent”
      (Serbia and Montenegro v. Netherlands, Preliminary Objections,
      Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 1026, para. 35).

Therefore, it can be said that in substance the jurisdiction of the Court is
governed by the law in force between the parties, while jus standi is gov-
erned by objective rules of the Statute as such.
   Quatro, the differing natures of jus standi, on the one hand, and
jurisdiction ratione personae, on the other, generate corresponding
legal consequences in the proceedings. A lack of jus standi
possesses an automatic effect, since, as a rule, it cannot be over-
come in the proceedings before the Court, while a lack of juris-
diction ratione personae is surmountable as the parties may either
confer jurisdiction upon the Court in the course of the proceedings


                                                          uA)
or perfect it — for instance, by express agreement or by forum
prorogatum.
  As a consequence, in contrast to a lack of jus standi, the absence of
jurisdiction ratione personae does not preclude valid seisin of the Court.

  Quinto, the competence or special jurisdiction in the particular case of
the International Court of Justice, as a semi-open court of law with juris-
diction based on consent of the parties to a dispute, implies twofold con-
sent by States :

(a) consent that the Court is “an organ instituted for the purpose jus
    dicere” (Corfu Channel, Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 1948,
    I.C.J. Reports 1947-1948, dissenting opinion of Judge Daxner,
    p. 39). This consent is expressed indirectly, through membership of
    the United Nations, or directly, in the case of a non-Member of the
    United Nations either by adhering to the Statute of the Court or by
    accepting the general jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with
    Security Council resolution 9 (1946), as a preliminary condition ;
    and
(b) consent that the Court is competent to deal with the particular dis-
    pute or type of dispute which is given through relevant jurisdictional
    bases under Article 36 of the Statute, as a substantive but qualified
    condition.
   As the Court stated in the Nottebohm case : “under the system of the
Statute the seisin of the Court by means of an Application is not ipso
facto open to all States parties to the Statute, it is only open to the extent
defined in the applicable Declarations” (Nottebohm (Liechtenstein v.
Guatemala), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953,
p. 122). The principle was further elaborated by the Court in the Legality
of the Use of Force case :
         “Whereas the Court, under its Statute, does not automatically
      have jurisdiction over legal disputes between States parties to that
      Statute or between other States to whom access to the Court has
      been granted . . . whereas the Court can therefore exercise jurisdic-
      tion only between States parties to a dispute who not only have
      access to the Court but also have accepted the jurisdiction of the
      Court, either in general form or for the individual dispute con-
      cerned.” (Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999, I.C.J. Reports
      1999 (I), pp. 549-550, para. 20 ; emphasis added.)

   36. In the application of the two autonomous rules — jurisdiction
ratione personae and jus standi — with their own objects and effects, the
latter possesses logical and normative priority. Jus standi, as an expres-
sion of the right to judicial protection is antecedent in nature, is a pre-
liminary question which “should be taken in advance of any question of


                                                          uA)
competence” (Northern Cameroons (Cameroons v. United Kingdom),
Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports 1963, separate opinion of Sir
G. Fitzmaurice, p. 105 ; emphasis in the original). For

        “The Court can exercise its judicial function only in respect of
      those States which have access to it under Article 35 of the Statute.
      And only those States which have access to the Court can confer
      jurisdiction upon it.” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Mon-
      tenegro v. Netherlands), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
      Reports 2004, p. 1030, para. 45.)

4. Assessment of the Respondent’s jus standi by the majority


  37. The majority assessment of the Respondent’s jus standi is some-
what confused and significantly self-contradictory, mostly because it
seeks to reconcile the irreconcilable.
  As regards the nature of jus standi, i.e., whether or not it is an autono-
mous processual requirement, the position of the majority is that it “may
be regarded as an issue prior to that of jurisdiction ratione personae, or
as one constitutive element within the concept of jurisdiction ratione per-
sonae” (Judgment, para. 102).
  The finding could be considered correct if it related to the terminology
used in relation to these two notions, but not in the present context.

   If, as pointed out, jus standi, in contrast to jurisdictional issues, “is not
a matter of the consent of the parties” (ibid.), then obviously the latter
understanding does not apply. Like any other processual requirement, jus
standi cannot simultaneously be based on the consent of the parties and
on the requirements of the Statute, which is not a matter of consent, as
stated in the Judgment in the Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Mon-
tenegro v. Belgium) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 295, para. 36) to
which reference is made.

   After all, in further reasoning the Judgment determines jus standi in
negative terms as a distinct condition by saying that “the capacity to
appear before the Court . . . was an element in the reasoning of the 1996
Judgment, which can — and indeed must — be read into the Judgment as
a matter of logical construction” (Judgment, para. 135 ; emphasis added).
If jus standi is indeed an element of jurisdiction ratione personae, then
there is probably no need for any “logical construction” on the basis of
which jus standi, although unstated, should be read into the judgment. It
appears, however, that the legal situation is a different one. As the Court
stated in the South West Africa cases :

        “It is a universal and necessary, but yet almost elementary princi-


                                                          uA)
      ple of procedural law that a distinction has to be made between . . .
      the right to activate a court and the right of a court to examine the
      merits of the claim.” (South West Africa, Second Phase, Judgment,
      I.C.J. Reports 1966, p. 39, para. 64 ; Fisheries Jurisdiction, (United
      Kingdom v. Iceland), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J.
      Reports 1973, p. 53, para. 11.)

   Jus standi can be perceived as an element of jurisdiction ratione per-
sonae only if in a descriptive sense or if jurisdiction ratione personae is
understood lato sensu to comprise different legal concepts set out in Arti-
cles 35 and 36 of the Statute.
   38. In casu, the relevant issue is not jurisdiction ratione personae, but
the issue of the right of Serbia to appear before the Court. The petitum
non-preliminary objection of Serbia is its jus standi and not jurisdiction
ratione personae, and causa petendi is Article 35 of the Statute and not its
Article 36. In that sense, the finding of the Court in Asylum case seems
applicable. In the said case, the Court, inter alia, found :


      “the question of the surrender of the refugee was not decided by the
      Judgment of November 20th. This question is new . . . There is con-
      sequently no res judicata upon the question of surrender.” (I.C.J.
      Reports 1951, p. 80.)

It is true that the Respondent, while invoking the lack of jus standi on its
part, uses also the expression “jurisdiction ratione personae”. But, that
fact can hardly be excusable for the Court because involved here is a
questio juris which falls within the ambit of the rule of jura novit curia.
   39. The Judgment correctly recognizes that the capacity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to appear before the Court in accordance with
the Statute “was unstated” in the 1996 Judgment, that is, that “[n]othing
was stated in the 1996 Judgment about . . . whether it [Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia] could participate in proceedings before the Court . . .”
(Judgment, para. 122). The matter is clearly self-evident.
   And it is self-evident not only as regards the dispositif of the Judgment,
at that. The reasons in point of law which served as the basis for the dis-
positif of the Judgment are basically limited to the question whether the
parties to the dispute could have been considered parties to the Genocide
Convention (1996 Judgment, paras. 17-20), and to such related issues as
automatic succession in relation to certain types of international treaties
and conventions (ibid., paras. 21, 23), the nature of the Genocide Con-
vention (ibid., para. 22) and the effect of non-recognition of the contrac-
tual nexus between parties to a multilateral treaty (ibid., paras. 25, 26).

  Ergo, the evidence appears to be incontrovertible : the Court’s
Judgment of 11 July 1996 did not, either in the dispositif or in
the principles underlying it, touch upon, let alone decide, the issue


                                                          uA)
of the jus standi of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the
Court.
   Moreover, there is no trace in other components of the 1996 Judg-
ment — the headnote setting out the main issues discussed, the summary
of the proceedings, including the parties’ submissions — indicating that
the Court at least considered the issue.
   However, the majority has not drawn the necessary consequences from
factum proprium. Regardless of possible differences in the perception of
the res judicata rule as regards its nature and effects, there remain the
classic intrinsic conditions for the application of the rule in casu. And it
is obvious, on the basis of the majority view itself, that one of the ele-
ments — identity of the question at issue eadem res — is lacking, which
automatically disqualifies the rule from application in relation to the
1996 Judgment.

  40. The judgment has been construed by inference, which, combined
with a peculiar perception of the res judicata rule, is supposed to avert
the necessary consequences of the Respondent’s lack of jus standi in the
present case.
  The main elements of the reasoning come down to the following :
   The operative part of the 1996 Judgment saying that “on the basis of
Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the Crime of Genocide, [the Court] has jurisdiction to decide upon
the dispute”, being res judicata, established the jurisdiction of the Court
in casu
      “with the full weight of the Court’s judicial authority. For a party to
      assert today that, at the date the 1996 Judgment was given, the
      Court had no power to give it, because one of the parties can now be
      seen to have been unable to come before the Court is . . . to call in
      question the force as res judicata of the operative clause of the Judg-
      ment.” (Judgment, para. 123.)

The fact that the Court has given no consideration to, let alone decided
upon, the jus standi of the Respondent is of no significance, because it
must be considered
      “by necessary implication, to mean that the Court at that time per-
      ceived the Respondent as being in a position to participate in cases
      before the Court. On that basis, it proceeded to make a finding on
      jurisdiction which would have the force of res judicata.” (Judgment,
      para. 132.)
  The reasoning arising by “necessary implication” continues, so that

      “the express finding in the 1996 Judgment that the Court had juris-
      diction in the case ratione materiae, . . . is a finding which is only


                                                          uA)
      consistent, in law and logic, with the proposition that, in
      relation to both Parties, it had jurisdiction ratione personae in its
      comprehensive sense, that is to say, that the status of each of them
      was such as to comply with the provisions of the Statute concerning
      the capacity of States to be parties before the Court” (Judgment,
      para. 133).
   The “necessary implication” underlying the reasoning referred to above
is, in fact, an attempt to incorporate inferential judgment, or judgment by
implication, into the sphere of judicial reasoning.

   Given the very concept of judgment, i.e., that “[n]othing was stated in
the 1996 Judgment about . . . whether it [the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia] could participate in proceedings before the Court . . .” (Judgment,
para. 122), the requirements relating to the content and structure of judg-
ments, as laid down in Article 56, paragraph 1, of the Statute and Arti-
cle 95, paragraph 1, of the Rules, the underlying legal considerations and,
even common sense, the interpretation of the Judgment by inference is, at
the very least, contradictio in adiecto. In particular, in relation to the
issue of jus standi, which can by no means be said to be dependent on,
or for that matter an aspect of, the issue of jurisdiction ratione
personae which was formally decided. It is not only a distinct and
autonomous issue but also one that determines objective limits of the
judicial power of the Court, legality of its actions in terms of objective
international law.


   41. The wording of the Judgment suggests that the reason why the
Court did not consider and decide upon jus standi of the Respondent was
the position taken in that regard by Parties to the dispute, but particu-
larly the Respondent.
        “Nothing was stated in the 1996 Judgment about . . . the question
      whether it [the FRY] could participate in proceedings before the
      Court ; for . . . both Parties had chosen to refrain from asking for a
      decision on these matters.” (Judgment, para. 122.)
The Respondent raised seven preliminary objections, but “[n]one of these
objections were however founded on a contention that the FRY was not
a party to the Statute at the relevant time ; that was not a contention spe-
cifically advanced in the proceedings on the preliminary objections”
(Judgment, para. 106).
   Owing to the nature of the issue of jurisdiction, the reason is not effec-
tive as an excuse and has no legal effect in the matter at hand.

   42. In view of the fact that “the establishment or otherwise of jurisdic-
tion is not a matter for the parties but for the Court itself” (Fisheries
Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment,


                                                          uA)
I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 450, para. 37 ; also, separate opinion of Presi-
dent McNair in the jurisdiction phase of the case concerning Anglo-
Iranian Oil Co., in which he stated that “[a]n international tribunal
cannot regard a question of jurisdiction solely as a question inter partes”
(Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 116)),
the dispute between the parties as to the jurisdiction in the prelimi-
nary objection phase is not a necessary condition for the Court to
address the issue of jurisdiction and, a fortiori, the issue of jus
standi.

  Preliminary objections raised by a party are only a tool, a procedurally
designed weapon for the establishment of the jurisdiction of the Court,
suo nomine et suo vigore, for it is under an obligation to do so ex officio.
The legal significance of proceedings on preliminary objections was
defined by the Court in the case concerning Rights of Minorities in Upper
Silesia (Minority Schools) (hereinafter referred to as “Minority Schools”
as follows :
     “the raising of an objection by one Party merely draws the attention
     of the Court to an objection to the jurisdiction which it must ex offi-
     cio consider” (Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Minority
     Schools), Judgment No. 12, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 15, p. 23 ;
     emphasis added).
  Or, as stated by the Court in the Genocide Convention case :

      “[t]he Court must, in each case submitted to it, verify whether it has
      jurisdiction to deal with the case, . . . [s]uch objections as are raised
      by the Respondent may be useful to clarify the legal situation” (Pre-
      liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 622,
      para. 46 ; emphasis added).

   Accordingly, the establishment by the Court of its jurisdiction in casu
is not necessarily linked with the dispute as to jurisdiction. If the Court is
under a duty to verify its jurisdiction in each specific case whether or not
there is a preliminary objection as such, then the pleadings of the parties
in the proceedings are not a fortiori of decisive importance in that
respect. If, as Shabtai Rosenne, commenting on the case concerning
Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (hereinafter referred to as
“Monetary Gold”) says :

      “[t]he fact that an objection is made does not mean — in the eyes of
      the Court — that the Court is being asked not to determine the mer-
      its of the claim under any circumstances” 22,

  22 Shabtai Rosenne, The Law and Practice of the International Court, 1920-1996, 3rd

ed., Vol. II, Jurisdiction, 1997, p. 863.


                                                            uA)
then the contrary is equally valid, i.e., that the Court is being asked not
to determine the merits of the claim if an objection to the preliminary
objection is not made. Extensive practice of the Court to this effect has
been established.
   The Court’s dictum in the case concerning the Appeal Relating to the
Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council (hereinafter referred to as “ICAO
Council”) may be taken as a synthesis of that practice : “[t]he Court must
however always be satisfied that it has jurisdiction, and must if necessary
go into that matter proprio motu” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 52,
para. 13).
   This is also reflected in the opinions of judges. In the case concerning
Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judge Moore in his dissenting
opinion stated that “even though the Parties be silent, the tribunal, if it
finds that competence is lacking, is bound of its own motion to dismiss
the case” (Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 58) ; in the
Minority Schools case, Judge Huber in his dissenting opinion found that
the Court “must ex officio ascertain on what legal foundation it is to base
its judgment upon the claims of the Parties” (Judgment No. 12, 1928,
P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 15, p. 54) ; and in the case concerning the Free
Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Judge Kellogg pointed
out in his observations attached to the Order of 6 December 1930
that it was not necessary that the question of jurisdiction be raised
by one of the parties, since “[i]t may and should be raised by the
Court on its own initiative, as was done in the Eastern Carelia
case” (Order of 6 December 1930, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 24,
p. 43).
   43. As a questio juris 23, the jurisdiction of the Court is within the
scope of the principle jura novit curia. In the case concerning Territorial
Jurisdiction of the International Commission of the River Oder (herein-
after referred to as “River Oder”) it was not until the oral proceedings
that the Polish Government contended that the Barcelona Convention
had not been ratified by Poland. The six Respondents asked the
Court to reject the Polish contention a limine, for having been sub-
mitted at such an advanced stage of the proceedings. The Court dismissed
the objection as untenable for “[t]he fact that Poland has not ratified
the Barcelona Convention not being contested, it is evident that the


  23 “The existence of jurisdiction of the Court in a given case is ... not a question of fact,

but a question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant facts.” (Border and Trans-
border Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 76, para. 16.) The question of the Court’s jurisdiction is

      “necessarily an antecedent and independent one — an objective question of law —
      which cannot be governed by preclusive considerations capable of being so expressed
      as to tell against either Party — or both Parties” (Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
      of the ICAO Council, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 54, para. 16 (c)).



                                                          uA)
matter is purely one of law such as the Court . . . should examine
ex officio” (Judgment No. 16, 1929, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 23,
p. 19).
   Being bound by law, the Court is not bound by the arguments of the
parties. This follows clearly from the principle jura novit curia addressed
by the Court in its Judgments in the cases concerning Fisheries Jurisdic-
tion (United Kingdom v. Iceland) and Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal
Republic of Germany v. Iceland) :

        “The Court . . . as an international judicial organ, is deemed to
      take judicial notice of international law, and is therefore required in
      a case falling under Article 53 of the Statute, as in any other case, to
      consider on its own initiative all rules of international law which
      may be relevant to the settlement of the dispute . . . for the law lies
      within the judicial knowledge of the Court.” (Merits, Judgment,
      I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 9, para. 17 ; ibid., p. 181, para. 18 ; emphasis
      added.)

The principle has also been confirmed in the Nicaragua case by a dictum :

     “[f]or the purpose of deciding whether the claim is well founded in
     law, the principle jura novit curia signifies that the Court is not solely
     dependent on the argument of the parties before it with respect to
     the applicable law” (Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 24,
     para. 29 ; cf. “Lotus”, Judgment No. 9, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A,
     No. 10, p. 31).
Consequently, the rule according to which a party seeking to assert a fact
must bear the burden of proving it “has no relevance for the establish-
ment of the Court’s jurisdiction” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.
Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 450, para. 37).
   44. Accordingly, in these circumstances, in its 1996 Judgment the
Court proceeded from the “assumption” that the FRY possessed the
right to appear before the Court in accordance with the Statute
(Judgment, para. 135).
   That assumption “was an element in the reasoning of the 1996 Judgment
which can — and indeed must — be read into the judgment as a matter
of logical construction” (ibid.). It does not, however, follow that “that
element is not one which can at any time be reopened and
re-examined . . .” (ibid.).
   The reasoning seems to fail to take into account the differences between
legal assumptions (praesumptio juris) and judicial (praesumptio facti vel
homine), into which category the “assumption” regarding the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia’s jus standi before the Court actually falls.



                                                           uA)
  Judicial presumption, along with legal presumption 24, is one of the
main sorts of presumption in international law.
  It means that a certain fact or state of affairs, even though it has not been
proved, is taken by an international tribunal as truthful. As such it does
not necessarily coincide with, or is not equivalent to, the fact or the state
of affairs.

   Considerations of a practical nature prevail in the rationale for the use
of judicial presumption.
   Judicial presumption is a tool used to preclude a long wait in discov-
ering the full facts and exact situation on which depends the existence,
content or cessation of the right where such protracted periods would
have adverse consequences for the parties concerned or would impede the
due course of legal proceedings.

  45. As a sort of presumption, a judicial presumption has some specific
features differentiating it from a legal presumption (praesumptio juris).

  Two principal features of judicial presumption should be mentioned in
this regard.
   Primo, judicial presumption is, as a rule, a natural, factual presump-
tion (praesumptio facti vel homine) having no basis in the particular
rules that constitute the law of the international tribunal or the law it is
applying. It is an inherent element of the legal reasoning of the interna-
tional tribunal in interpreting and applying the rules of law.




  24 Better known than judicial presumptions, legal presumptions (praesumptio juris) are

widely applied in international law. International tribunals are used to resorting to proof
by inferences of fact (présomption de fait) or circumstantial evidence (Corfu Channel,
Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 18). For legal presumption in the practice of the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, see T. Buergenthal, R. Norris and D. Shelton,
Protecting Human Rights in the Americas, Selected Problems, 2nd ed., 1986, pp. 130-132
and pp. 139-144.

   The practice of international courts abounds in presumptions based on general principles
of international law, whether positive such as presumptions of good faith (exempli causa,
Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions, Judgment No. 5, 1925, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 5,
p. 43) or negative such as presumptions of abuse of right (Certain German Interests in
Polish Upper Silesia, Merits, Judgment No. 7, 1926, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 7, p. 30 ; Free
Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Order of 6 December 1930, P.C.I.J.,
Series A, No. 24, p. 12 ; Corfu Channel, Merits, Judgment, 1949, I.C.J. Reports 1949,
p. 119 : dissenting opinion of Judge Ecer). They possess special weight in the interpreta-
tion of treaties since the function of treaty interpretation is to discover “what was, or what
may reasonably be presumed to have been, the intention of the parties to a treaty when
they concluded it” (Harvard Law School, Research in International Law, Part III, Law of
Treaties, Art. 19, p. 940 ; emphasis added).



                                                         uA)
  Secundo, in contrast to legal presumptions which can be irrefutable
(praesumptio juris et de jure), judicial presumptions as natural or factual
ones are, by definition, refutable. Their refutability is, however, specific in
nature.

  Given that it is a part of the reasoning of the international tribunal, a
judicial presumption cannot be refutable in the same way that a legal pre-
sumption can be. A judicial presumption, as such, is in fact capable of
being abandoned or replaced by the international tribunal.

   In its legal reasoning the international tribunal abandons it, or replaces
it, by another presumption or established fact. In the strict sense, only
those findings or decisions of the international tribunal that are based on
legal presumptions are refutable. However, judicial presumptions lose the
ratio of their existence when the international tribunal identifies the con-
troversial matter in controversy which constitutes its object. They then
fall away by themselves because they are deprived of their subject. But
even then it is the duty of the international tribunal to refute, in the
proper proceedings, its own finding or decision based on presumption.



   Also, in contrast to a legal presumption, a judicial presumption is not,
and by its effects cannot be equated with, a judicial finding of the Court,
being its factual substitute. Hence, it cannot be considered that, by rely-
ing on that particular presumption, the Court has taken a decision on the
Respondent’s jus standi. Rather, the Court has done so factually as an
element of its reasoning.


  46. The rationale of judicial presumptions is provisionally to substi-
tute for proven facts or circumstances in order to avert delay in identify-
ing the exact facts and situations where such delay is likely to have
adverse consequences for the parties to a dispute or to impede the due
course of legal proceedings.

  However, after the true facts and circumstances have been established,
judicial presumptions should be abandoned and replaced by proven facts.
A contrario, if a court of law stands by legal presumptions in preference
to proven facts, it maintains a judicial fiction, its own truth, in the face of
facts and situations in terms of law.

  The Court is doing exactly this by clinging to the assumption about the
Respondent’s jus standi, and the inextricably related issue of the Respon-
dent’s membership in the United Nations in the period 1992-2000.




                                                          uA)
5. The effects of the 2004 Judgment

   47. The question of the Respondent’s United Nations membership as
determinative in regard to its jus standi before the Court, in the circum-
stances surrounding the issue, seems, considering its being of a status
nature, to have been solved by the Court’s Judgment in the Legality of
Use of Force cases in 2004. Also, the majority holds the view that the
FRY was admitted to the United Nations “as a new member in 2000”
(Judgment, para. 109). However, the Court has not drawn from that fact,
a fact of decisive jurisdictional significance in casu, necessary conse-
quences regarding the jus standi of the Respondent. The reason for this
has been found in the recognition of the Parties that these Judgments “do
not constitute res judicata for the purposes of the present proceedings”
(Judgment, para. 84). Two observations may be made in respect of this
determination of the effects of the 2004 Judgments. Primo, the question
of the effects of the Court’s judgments is a questio juris and, as such,
within the ambit of the principle of jura novit curia signifying that the
Court is not dependent on the agreement of the parties with respect to
the applicable law. Secundo, the effects of a judgment are not fully
exhausted by the rule of res judicata.


   48. It is hardly necessary to say that the Court’s Judgment of 15 Decem-
ber 2004 in the Legality of Use of Force cases does not produce the
effects of res judicata in the present case, given that one of the intrinsic
elements of the res judicata rule — eadem personae — is lacking. Bosnia
and Herzegovina was not a party in the Legality of Use of Force cases.
Consequently, it is not bound by the Court’s decision in those cases qua
decision.
   49. That is one point. The material effects of the 2004 Judgment on
the case at hand are another. It is clearly established in the jurisprudence
of the Court that the material effects of a decision of the Court are not
necessarily limited to the case decided and therefore may, depending on
circumstances, occasionally extend beyond it.

  In the Aegean Sea case the Court stated inter alia :
         “Although under Article 59 of the Statute ‘the decision of the
      Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect
      of that particular case’, it is evident that any pronouncement of the
      Court as to the status of the 1928 [General Act for the Pacific Set-
      tlement of International Disputes], whether it were found to be a
      convention in force or to be no longer in force, may have implica-
      tions in relations between States other than Greece and Turkey
      [Parties to the present proceedings].” (I.C.J. Reports 1978, pp. 17-
      18, para. 39 ; emphasis added.)



                                                             uA)
A narrow interpretation of Article 59 simply does not fit into the corpus
of the Court’s law25.
   50. Accordingly, the real question in concreto is not whether there are
material effects of the 2004 Judgment on the case at hand, but “whether,
in this case, there is cause not to follow the reasoning and conclusions of
earlier cases” (Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and
Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1998, para. 28), or to treat the 2004 Judgment “as a statement of
what the Court regarded as the correct legal position” (Temple of Preah
Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1961, p. 27) in the matter.

   51. It appears not only that such cause does not exist, but that there
are moreover several reasons why the Court should follow its earlier rea-
soning, which inevitably leads to the conclusions adapted by the Court in
its 2004 Judgment.

  First of all, the relevant issue — was the Respondent a member of the
United Nations at the material point in time and, as such, a party to the
Statute of the Court — in the identical form, followed by identical legal
consequences, is posed in both cases. The locus standi of Serbia and
Montenegro in the present proceedings is, exactly as in the Legality of
Use of Force cases, inextricably linked with membership in the
United Nations, owing to the fact that Serbia and Montenegro could
not be considered to be a party to the Statute on any basis other
than membership in the United Nations, the fact that its locus standi
cannot be based on the conditions set forth in Article 35, paragraph 2,
of the Statute. As a rule, a given factual state and legal status
occurring in two different cases demands equal treatment under


  25   “If it is true that a Judgment of the Court is clothed with authority of res judicata
       only in the case which has been decided, that would mean that if the lis concerns the
       interpretation of a clause of a treaty, the interpretation given could be used again in
       arguments in any future lis concerning the same clause of a treaty. Such a result
       would not only be absurd ; it would put Article 59 in irreconcilable contradiction with
       the last sentence of Article 63 of the same Statute, which provides that when a third
       state intervenes in a case in which there is in question the construction of a multilat-
       eral convention to which it and the States concerned in the case are parties, the con-
       struction given by the Court will be equally binding on that state.” (Lighthouses
       Arbitration (France v. Greece), Permanent Court of Arbitration, 23 ILR 81 at
       86 (1956).)

the principles of consistency of judicial reasoning and equality before the
Court.

   Furthermore, the Court, by finding that “at the time of filing of its
Application to institute . . . proceedings before the Court on 29 April 1999,
the Applicant in the present case, Serbia and Montenegro, was not a
Member of the United Nations” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and
Montenegro v. Portugal), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 2004, p. 1195, para. 90), basically took judicial notice of a fact
objectively established by the competent organs of the United Nations,
which in the context of the case operated as a jurisdictional fact of deci-
sive significance. United Nations General Assembly resolution 55/12 as
such has created an objective legal status which is erga omnes in charac-
ter. Even if we leave aside the binding force of resolution 55/12, that part
of the Judgment of the Court concerning the determination of the status
of Serbia and Montenegro vis-à-vis the United Nations in the relevant
period of time remains none the less, by its nature, a declaratory judg-
ment in rem producing conclusive effects at least as regards States parties
to the Statute of the Court. As such, the Judgment cannot, in that part,
be treated as a judgment in personam, having conclusive effects only
between the parties to the case, because its subject matter is the status of
Serbia and Montenegro both in relation to the United Nations itself and
in relation to the Members of the United Nations.

  52. Resolution 55/12 belongs to the species of United Nations General
Assembly resolutions having a definitive and binding effect within the
United Nations structure as a whole.
           “Article 18 [of the Charter] deals with ‘decisions’ of the General
        Assembly ‘on important questions’. These ‘decisions’ do indeed include
        certain recommendations, but others have dispositive force and effect.
        Among these latter decisions, Article 18 26 includes suspension of
        rights and privileges of membership, expulsion of Members . . . In
        connection with the suspension of rights and privileges of member-
        ship and expulsion from membership under Articles 5 and 6, it is the
        Security Council which has only the power to recommend and it is
        the General Assembly which decides and whose decision determines
        status.” (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, Para-
        graph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962,
        p. 163 ; emphasis added.)


  26   Article 18 of the Charter reads :
         “2. Decisions of the General Assembly on important questions shall be made by a
       two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. These questions shall
       include : ... the admission of new Members to the United Nations, the suspension of
       the rights and privileges of membership, the expulsion of Members ...”


                                                          uA)
   On the basis of Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Charter “The admission
of any . . . State to membership in the United Nations will be effected by
a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the
Security Council” (emphasis added).
   53. Lying within the exclusive competence of two principal political
organs of the United Nations, the Security Council and the General
Assembly, decisions on the admission of a State to the United Nations
are a part of international law which “[the Court] . . . is bound to
respect” (Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Mon-
treal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Provisional Measures, Order of
14 April 1992, I.C.J. Reports 1992, separate opinion of Judge Lachs,
p. 26). In the system of functional parallelism, it must be assumed as a
governing principle of relations between the principal organs of the
United Nations that the “Court must co-operate in the attainment of the
aims of the Organization and strive to give effect to the decisions of other
principal organs and not to achieve results which would render them
nugatory” 27.
   The determination that the Respondent enjoyed the status of member
as from 1 November 2004 became a part of the objective reality estab-
lished in the United Nations structures as a whole. In a letter to the Presi-
dent of the United Nations General Assembly, dated 27 December 2001,
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated :

        “I have the honour to refer to General Assembly resolution 55/12
      of 1 November 2000, in which the Assembly decided to admit the
      Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to membership in the United
      Nations. This decision necessarily and automatically terminated the
      membership in the Organization of the former Yugoslavia, the State
      admitted to membership in 1945.” 28
  Under the heading “Historical Information on Multilateral Treaties
Deposited with the Secretary-General” 29, it is stated expressis verbis that
the “Yugoslavia” to which the Legal Counsel referred in his letter of
29 September 1992 as the State whose membership in the Organization
“the resolution neither terminates nor suspends”, was the former
Yugoslavia, i.e., the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, not the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia : “The Legal Counsel took the view,
however, that this resolution of the General Assembly neither terminated
nor suspended the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United
Nations.”

   It is also relevant that no State has objected to the legal opinion of the
United Nations Legal Counsel referred to above, in contrast to the posi-
tion of United Nations Member States with respect to the description of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a predecessor State made in the
“Summary of Practice of the Secretary-General as depositary of Multi-
lateral Treaties” 30 ; in response to the objections raised, the Legal Coun-
sel issued “Errata” 31 which, inter alia, deleted the description of the Fed-
eral Republic of Yugoslavia as a predecessor State.

   54. This fact taken per se evidences universal acceptance both by the
Member States of the United Nations and by the organs of the Organiza-
tion of the legal consequences of the admission of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to membership of the United Nations. The Court summa-
rized these as follows :
         “The Applicant [Serbia and Montenegro] thus has the status of
       membership in the United Nations as from 1 November 2000. How-
       ever, its admission to the United Nations did not have, and could
       not have had, the effect of dating back to the time when the Socialist
       Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up and disappeared ; there
       was in 2000 no question of restoring the membership rights of the
       Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the benefit of the Fed-
       eral Republic of Yugoslavia.” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and
       Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
       Reports 2004, p. 310, para. 78.)

  55. This interpretation of the meaning of resolution 47/1 is not a new
one. It should be noted that it was advocated in the literature as well. In
an article entitled “The New United Nations and Former Yugoslavia”,
Professor Rosalyn Higgins wrote :
         “The Assembly did recommend that the new Federal Republic
       (Serbia-Montenegro) should apply for membership of the United
       Nations. But the resolution did not either suspend, or terminate,
       Yugoslavia’s membership in the UN. The outcome has been anoma-
       lous in the extreme. The seat and nameplate remain as before. The
       old Yugoslav flag continues to fly on the 42nd Street. ‘Yugoslavia
       remains a member of the UN, i.e., not Serbia and Montenegro, but
       Yugoslavia in its entirety.’ ” 32


   56. Although it limited itself in the dispositif to the determination of
its jurisdiction to entertain the case, the Court essentially dealt, in the

reasoning part of the 2004 Judgment, with the question of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia’s membership in the United Nations in the rele-
vant time period. The Court’s finding that the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia was not a member of the United Nations before its admission to
the Organization in November 2000 was of fundamental importance in
the circumstances surrounding the issue of the Court’s competence in
casu.
   57. The dispositif in the 2004 Judgment was not the result of the rea-
soning by the Court in selecting among alternatives or choosing one of
several different interpretations for which the relevant jurisdictional fact
would provide a motive ; it was the unavoidable result of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia’s non-membership status in the United Nations
or, in other words, a kind of judicial notice of the fact established by the
principal political organs in the exercise of their exclusive competence
under the United Nations Charter, which, in the circumstances of the
present case, operates as the jurisdictional fact of decisive importance.

   Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, like resolu-
tion 55/12, create an objective legal situation, a status with erga omnes
effects. This fact is reflected in the effects of the Judgments of the Court
by which such a status is established ad casum.
   58. Judgments of the Court on the status issue, in their effect ratione
personae, cannot, unlike other judgments, be limited to the Parties to a
dispute. Their material effects surpass the effects of the judgment defined
in Article 60 of the Statute. By the very nature of their object, judgments
on status issues, which do not allow for uncertainty and insecurity, act
intra partes. The effect of a judgment on status, i.e., the creation of an
objective legal situation (situation légale objective) 33, is incorporated in
the national laws of civilized nations 34.

   However, this is not a question of the technical effect, under Article 59
of the Statute, of judgments on status issues intra partes but a question of
the material, reflective effect of such judgments on third States. It is bind-
ing erga omnes not as a judicial act in the formal sense, but as a result of
its intrinsic persuasive force, in parallel with the mandatory force of the
judgment in the technical sense, based on the presumption of truthful-
ness — pro veritate accipitur — which must, in questions of status, as
absolute law, have universal effect. This is especially valid for judgments
of the Court, like the Judgment in the Legality of Use of Force cases,


  33 Dugguit, Traité de droit constitutionnel, 1923, Vol. II.
  34 For instance, the novel Article 311 of the Code civil (law of 1972), see Vincent,
op. cit., p. 108, No. 79 ; in Italian law it is traditionally considered that decisions on status
matters act erga omnes — for examples of judgments by Italian courts, see Pugliese,
op. cit., p. 888 ; British law has, in that sense, the special notion “judgments in rem” (see
Bower, Turner and Handley, “The Doctrine of Res Judicata”, 1965, pp. 213 et seq.).



                                                          uA)
which, basically, merely gives judicial confirmation to the status conclu-
sively determined by the competent organs of the United Nations (see
Judgment, paras. 88 et seq.).

   59. It seems crystal clear that the Respondent’s jus standi in casu
is, as in the Legality of Use of Force cases, organically linked
to its membership in the United Nations owing to the fact that
the Respondent could not be considered to be a party to the Statute
on any basis apart from that of being a Member State of the United
Nations and to the fact that its jus standi cannot be based on the
conditions set forth in Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
Court.
   The majority approach to this “twin” issue is truly astonishing.

  On the one hand, it is recognized that “in 1999 — and even more so in
1996 — it was by no means so clear as the Court found it to be in 2004
that the Respondent was not a Member of the United Nations” (Judg-
ment, para. 131 ; emphasis added).

  On the other,
      “as a matter of law, no possibility that the Court might render ‘its
      final decision with respect to a party over which it cannot exercise
      its judicial function’, because the question whether a State is or is
      not a party subject to the jurisdiction of the Court is one which is
      reserved for the sole and authoritative decision of the Court . . . the
      operation of the ‘mandatory requirements of the Statute’ falls to be
      determined by the Court in each case before it ; and once the
      Court has determined, with the force of res judicata, that it has
      jurisdiction, then for the purposes of that case no question of ultra
      vires action can arise, the Court having sole competence to
      determine such matters under the Statute” (Judgment, paras. 138
      and 139).
   The reasoning suggests that quidquid judicii placuit, habet legis vig-
orem. It reflects the anachronistic and totally unacceptable idea that the
Court is not the guardian but the creator of legality and, in fact, that the
Court makes decisions independently from objective law established by
its Statute.
   It nolens volens leads to the creation of the Court’s own, judicial reality
in contrast to the objective legal one, producing a proper judicium illu-
sorum.
   The erroneous perception of the res judicata rule embodied in this
Judgment gives rise to an absurd ambivalence in respect of the Respon-
dent’s status in the United Nations.

   In contrast to the erga omnes effects of General Assembly resolu-
tion 55/12, the Court’s Judgment is, as provided by Article 59 of the Stat-


                                                         uA)
ute, binding only on the Parties to the case. This logically means that in
the context of the dispute before the Court the Respondent is considered,
at least tacitly, to have been a United Nations member in the period
1992-2000 as far as the Court and the Applicant are concerned, whereas
for the Organisation itself it was not a member and even for Bosnia and
Herzegovina, it was not a member in respect of any other matter than
this case itself. In addition, in the eyes of the Court, the Respondent is
considered a member of the United Nations in the present case and a
non-member in the Legality of Use of Force cases.


   60. The pronouncement that “in 1999 — and even more so in 1996 —
it was by no means so clear then as the Court found it to be in 2004 that
the Respondent was not a Member of the United Nations”, opens a very
unpleasant question of the activity of the Court in the present case in the
light of the principle of bona fidae which, as a peremptory one, is at least
equally valid for the Court as it is for States.

   If, for more than a decade, it was so clear to the Court that the
Respondent was not a Member of the United Nations, and the quality of
being a Member of the United Nations is the only basis on which the
Respondent could have been considered a party to the Statute
of the Court, it follows that the Court deliberately avoided
recognizing the jurisdictional fact affecting the very legality of the
totality of its actions in casu. Such a conduct of the Court could be
termed judicial arbitrariness, close or in the zone of abuse of judicial
power of the Court rather than judicial discretion resulting in judicial
indecision.

6. 1992 Declaration

   61. In its 1996 Judgment, the Court found jurisdiction ratione perso-
nae in the formal Declaration of 27 April 1992 adopted by the partici-
pants of the Joint Session of the SFRY Assembly, the National Assembly
of the Republic of Serbia and the Assembly of the Republic of Montene-
gro. The Court perceived it as a unilateral act that produces legal conse-
quences relevant as regards its jurisdiction ratione personae. This deter-
mination appears dubious and, it seems to me, requires reconsideration
in the light of the relevant rules of international law and the jurispru-
dence of the Court, respectively. Namely, reconsideration not only as
regards the presumption of the legal identity and continuity of the
Respondent with the SFRY, which proved unacceptable by the interna-
tional community and served as the basis for the finding of the Court, but
also as regards the characterization of the nature and effects of the
Declaration.



                                                           uA)
   62. Did the Declaration adopted on 27 April 1992 meet the relevant
requirements to be considered as a unilateral act producing legal conse-
quences ?
   63. It seems obvious that the issue of an act by a single state cannot by
itself qualify as a unilateral act capable of producing legal effects in foro
externo. The unilateral nature of an act is but one extrinsic element
which, when coupled with other elements, both extrinsic and intrinsic,
forms a unilateral legal act in terms of international law.

   64. In the circumstances of the case at hand a number of elements are
of special relevance. The primary extrinsic element concerns the capacity
of the participants in the Joint Session of the SFRY Assembly, the
National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia and the Assembly of the
Republic of Montenegro to perform unilateral acts in the sense of inter-
national law. The Joint Session of the SFRY Assembly, the National
Assembly of the Republic of Serbia and the Assembly of the Republic of
Montenegro was not constituted as the Parliament of the Federal Repub-
lic of Yugoslavia ; rather it was a body of representatives in statu nas-
cendi. Even if, arguendo, it represented the Parliament, it was obviously
not a State organ possessing the capacity to perform unilateral acts on
behalf of the State. Representatives of a State for purposes of formulat-
ing unilateral legal acts are heads of State, heads of Government and
ministers of foreign affairs 35. The rule has also been confirmed in the
jurisprudence of the Court (Legal Status of Eastern Greenland, Judg-
ment, 1933, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 53, p. 22). Consequently, it appears
that the Declaration, if designed as a unilateral legal act in foro externo,
was issued by an incompetent organ under international law and, as
such, produced no legal effects 36.



   65. True, the Declaration, as the Court found, “was confirmed in an
official Note of 27 April 1992 from the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia
to the United Nations, addressed to the Secretary-General.” (I.C.J.
Reports 1996 (II), p. 610, para. 17) The word “confirmed” in the present
context may have two meanings : a descriptive one in the sense that the
letter from the Permanent Representative reproduced the text of the Dec-
laration and a meaning as a “terminus technicus”, signifying confirma-
tion of a unilateral act of an unauthorized State organ. Neither of these
two possible meanings of the word “confirmed” can be accepted in con-

and Add.1.

creto. In respect of the descriptive meaning of the word “confirmed”, it is
obvious that the letter from the Permanent Representative 37 reproduces
the text of the Declaration only in part, i.e., citing only a small part
thereof relating exclusively to legal identity and continuity.
   By definition, the limited powers held by heads of permanent missions
to international organizations, including permanent missions to the
United Nations, negate the possibility of the official Note of the Perma-
nent Mission of Yugoslavia of 27 April 1992 being understood as “con-
firmation” of an act issued by an organ — if at the material point in time
it was an organ — incompetent under international law to perform legal
acts on behalf of the State.

   66. Hence, the proper characterization of the Note of the Yugoslav
Permanent Mission of 27 April 1992 is that of a transmission of the Dec-
laration followed by the corresponding reproduction of a part of the
Declaration directly connected with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s
proclaimed legal identity with and continuation of the former SFRY vis-
à-vis the United Nations.
   67. This characterization of the Note of the Yugoslav Permanent Mis-
sion suggests that the Declaration of 27 April 1992 and the Note of the
Permanent Mission are two distinct, yet not totally separate, acts, both
by their nature and by their effects. For its part, the Declaration is basi-
cally a general statement of policy with respect to matters directly or indi-
rectly connected with the issue of the proclaimed legal identity and State
continuity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while the Note seems
to be primarily a notification in the standard sense. Evidence to this effect
is found in the fact that the addressee of the Note was the Secretary-
General, who was requested to circulate the Declaration and the Note as
an official document of the General Assembly 38, whereas the Declaration
as such was addressed urbi et orbi.



  37   The text of the letter reads :
          “The Assembly of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at its session held
       on 27 April 1992, promulgated the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugosla-
       via. Under the Constitution, on the basis of the continuing personality of Yugoslavia
       and the legitimate decisions by Serbia and Montenegro to continue to live together
       in Yugoslavia, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of the
       Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro. Strictly respecting the
       continuity of the international personality of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of
       Yugoslavia shall continue to fulfil all the rights conferred to, and obligations
       assumed by, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in international relations,
       including its membership in all international organizations and participation in
       international treaties ratified or acceded to by Yugoslavia.” (United Nations

  68. Several intrinsic elements of the Declaration merit attention in this
particular context : its scope ratione materiae, the intention of the author
of the Declaration and its possible effects.
  69. As regards its scope ratione materiae, the Declaration covers sev-
eral different matters.
  The Declaration reads as follows :
         “The representatives of the people of the Republic of Serbia and
      the Republic of Montenegro,
         Expressing the will of the citizens of their respective Republics to
      stay in the common state of Yugoslavia,
         Accepting all basic principles of the Charter of the United
      Nations and the CSCE Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter,
      and particularly the principles of parliamentary democracy,
      market economy and respect for human rights and the
      rights of national minorities,

         Remaining strictly committed to a peaceful resolution of the Yugo-
      slav crisis,
         Wish to state in this Declaration their views on the basic, imme-
      diate and lasting objectives of the policy of their common state, and
      on its relations with the former Yugoslav Republics.
         In that regard, the representatives of the people of the Republic of
      Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro declare :
      1. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continuing the state, inter-
          national legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal
          Republic of Yugoslavia, shall strictly abide by all the commit-
          ments that the SFR of Yugoslavia assumed internationally.

            At the same time, it is ready to fully respect the rights and
         interests of the Yugoslav Republics which declared independ-
         ence. The recognition of the newly-formed States will follow after
         all the outstanding questions negotiated on within the Confer-
         ence on Yugoslavia have been settled,

            Remaining bound by all obligations to international organiza-
         tions and institutions whose member it is, the Federal
         Republic of Yugoslavia shall not obstruct the newly-formed
         States to join these organizations and institutions,
         particularly the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
         The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall respect and
         fulfil the rights and obligations the SFR of Yugoslavia
         assumed vis-à-vis the territories of Krajina which have
         been placed, within the framework of the United Nations
         peace-keeping operation, under the protection of the world
         Organization.


                                                          uA)
            The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also remains ready to
         negotiate, within the Conference on Yugoslavia, all problems
         related to the division of assets, which means both to assets and
         debts acquired jointly. In case of a dispute regarding these issues,
         the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall be ready to accept the
         arbitration of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.
      2. The diplomatic and consular missions of the Federal Republic of
         Yugoslavia abroad shall continue without interruption to per-
         form their functions of representing and protecting the interests
         of Yugoslavia. Until further notice, they shall continue to take
         care of all the assets of Yugoslavia abroad. They shall also extend
         consular protection to all nationals of the SFR of Yugoslavia
         whenever they request them to do so until a final regulation of
         their nationality status. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia rec-
         ognizes, at the same time, the full continuity of the representation
         of foreign states by their diplomatic and consular missions in its
         territory.


      3. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is interested in the reinstate-
         ment of economic, transport, energy and other flows and ties in
         the territory of the SFR of Yugoslavia. It is ready to make its full
         contribution to that end.

      4. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has no territorial aspirations
         towards any of its neighbours. Respecting the objectives and
         principles of the United Nations Charter and CSCE documents,
         it remains strictly committed to the principle of nonuse of force in
         settling any outstanding issues.
      5. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall ensure the highest
         standards of the protection of human rights and the rights of
         national minorities provided for in international legal instru-
         ments and CSCE documents. In addition, the Federal Republic
         of Yugoslavia is ready to grant the national minorities in its ter-
         ritory all those rights which would be recognized to and enjoyed
         by the national minorities in other CSCE participating States.

      6. In its foreign relations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall
         be guided by the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well
         as the principles of CSCE documents, particularly the Paris Char-
         ter for New Europe. As the founding member of the Movement
         of non-aligned countries, it shall remain committed to the prin-
         ciples and objectives of the policy of nonalignment.

            It shall develop relations of confidence and understanding with
         its neighbours proceeding from the principle of good neighbour-


                                                            uA)
          liness. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall, as a State of
          free citizens, be guided in its democratic development by the
          standards and achievements of the Council of Europe, the Euro-
          pean Community and other European institutions, with an ori-
          entation to join them in the foreseeable future.” (United Nations
          doc. A/46/915, Ann. I ; emphasis added.)
   It appears that, if viewed in isolation, only a part of the Declaration —
the extension of “consular protection to all nationals of the SFR of
Yugoslavia” — is capable per se of producing, certain effects, under cer-
tain conditions. Although not addressed to third States, it can, in a
broader context, be subsumed under the “power of auto-limitation which
States enjoyed under international law, in other words, their ability in the
exercise of their sovereignty to subject themselves to international legal
obligations” 39.

   In the part of the Declaration concerning “commitments that the
SFRY assumed internationally”, which is relevant for the assessment as
to whether the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could be considered
bound by the Genocide Convention, things are, however, fundamentally
different.

   70. Can the formulation “shall strictly abide by all the commit-
ments . . .” as such be understood as consent by the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to be bound by the Genocide Convention? That interpreta-
tion appears totally erroneous in the light of the rule of interpretation of
unilateral legal acts accepted in the Court’s jurisprudence. Where uni-
lateral acts of States are to be interpreted, “declarations . . . are to be
read as a whole” and “interpreted as a unity” (Fisheries Jurisdiction
(Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1998, pp. 452-454, paras. 47 and 44). Further, unilateral acts “must be
interpreted as [they stand], having regard to the words actually used.”
(Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1952, p. 105).

   The intention of the author of the Declaration is of key concern, since
“[w]hen it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it
should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the
declaration the character of a legal undertaking” (Nuclear Tests (Aus-
tralia v. France, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 267, para. 43 ; Nuclear
Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 472,
para. 46 ; Frontier Dispute, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 573-574,
paras. 39-40 ; emphasis added). When States “make statements by which
their freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is

called for” (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1974, p. 267, para. 44 ; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, pp. 472-473, para. 47 ; emphasis added).
   71. In the light of the rules of construction of unilateral legal acts, the
question naturally arises whether the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
had the intention to assume obligations ex foro externo by the Declara-
tion.
   72. If the Declaration is read as a whole and interpreted as a unity, the
answer must, it seems, be in the negative. It is set out in the introduction
part that the participants in the Joint Session of the SFRY Assembly, the
National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia and the Assembly of the
Republic of Montenegro “wish to state in this Declaration their views on
the basic, immediate and lasting objectives of the policy of their common
state and its relations with the former Yugoslav Republics” (emphasis
added). Statements of policy objectives are rarely found in the sphere of
international law. In the Nicaragua case the Court, considering the issue
as to whether any legal undertaking could be inferred from communica-
tions from the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction of
Nicaragua to the Secretary-General of the Organization of American
States accompanied by the “Plan to secure peace”, found inter alia :


         “This was an essentially political pledge, made not only to the
      Organization, but also to the people of Nicaragua, intended to be its
      first beneficiaries. . . . This part of the resolution is a mere statement
      which does not comprise any formal offer which if accepted would
      constitute a promise in law, and hence a legal obligation.” (Military
      and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.
      United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986,
      p. 132, para. 261 ; emphasis added.)

Furthermore, if, ex hypothesi, the participants had intended the Declara-
tion to produce legal effects, these effects would have been expressed as
the confirmation or safeguarding of existing rights and obligations rather
than as the assumption of obligations pro futuro. The interpretation of
the Declaration “according to its own terms” “as they stand” inevitably
leads to the conclusion, as also inferred by the Court itself, that the inten-
tion was “to remain bound by international treaties to which the former
Yugoslavia was a party” (I.C.J. Reports 1996, p. 610, para. 17 ; emphasis
added). And that pursuant to both legal considerations and the Declara-
tion itself means the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s legal identity and
continuity with the former SFRY. If, on the other hand, legal identity
and continuity was a condition on which depended the status of the Fed-
eral Republic of Yugoslavia as a party to multilateral conventions,
including the Genocide Convention, another highly relevant question
emerges : namely, is the Declaration as such capable of producing legal


                                                           uA)
effects without having been accepted, expressly or tacitly, by other inter-
national subjects, including the United Nations ?


   Obviously not, because declarations, like other unilateral acts, used to
carry out obligations in relation to treaties, are governed by the law of
treaties as applied to the particular convention. In general, unilateral
legal acts as such, being self-contained, are not in the nature of synallag-
matic obligations which form the substance of treaties.

  73. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide (1948) stipulates in Article XI :

        “The present Convention shall be open until 31 December 1949
      for signature on behalf of any Member of the United Nations and of
      any non-member State to which an invitation to sign has been
      addressed by the General Assembly.
        The present Convention shall be ratified, and the instruments of
      ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the
      United Nations.
        After 1 January 1950, the present Convention may be acceded
      to on behalf of any Member of the United Nations and of
      any non-member State which has received an invitation as
      aforesaid.
        Instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Secretary-
      General of the United Nations.”

  It would appear that ratification and accession are the sole means of
expressing consent to be bound by the Convention. Article XI expresses
the intention of the authors of the Convention :

         “The Secretariat’s draft provided as an alternative solution acces-
      sions only, on the theory that the approval of the Convention by the
      representatives of the governments in the General Assembly may
      obviate the necessity for signature. The ad hoc Committee, however,
      preferred the usual procedure of signature followed by ratification,
      for the original members.” 40

  74. It appears that the Court in addition strongly relied on the finding
that : “it has not been contested that Yugoslavia was party to the
Genocide Convention” (I.C.J. Reports 1996, p. 610, para. 17).
However, that finding does not seem convincing in the light
of the legal nature of the issue of jurisdiction (see paras. 41-44
above).

7. The issue of the respondent Party
  Serbia has been designated as the respondent Party on the basis of two
premises :
 (i) the status of Serbia as the continuing State vis-à-vis the State Union
     of Serbia and Montenegro ; and
(ii) the view that the Republic of Montenegro as the successor State is
     ipso facto relinquished of any form of delictual responsibility.
However, neither one of these two premises has been applied consist-
ently.
   As regards the first premise, it seems clear that Serbia is the legal con-
tinuator of the State Union of Serbia/Montenegro. A delicate question,
not even touched upon by the Judgment, is that of the legal status of Ser-
bia and Montenegro from 2000 onwards.

  75. At the end of the year 2000 the FRY, acting in the appropriate
context, did two things :
 (i) renounced the continuity claim and accepted the status of successor
     State to the former SFRY ; and
(ii) proceeding on the bases of this new capacity — as the successor
     State — submitted an application for admission to membership in
     the United Nations.
 76. The State, as a notion of international law, comprises two ele-
ments, i.e., has two facets :
 (i) statehood in the sense of the relevant attributes such as a defined ter-
     ritory, a stable population and sovereign power ;
(ii) legal personality, i.e., status as a subject of international law equipped
     with a corpus of rights and obligations. In the light of the relevant
     circumstances, the legal personality of the Federal Republic of Yugo-
     slavia can be either inferential and derivative in nature — based on
     legal identity with and continuation of the Socialist Federal Republic
     of Yugoslavia — or inherent and original in nature — based on
     status as a new State.
   77. By submitting an application for admission to membership in the
United Nations, Yugoslavia not only renounced the claim to legal iden-
tity and continuity ; it sought at the same time to be recognized as a new
State, one with a different legal personality — a successor State as
opposed to the partial continuation of the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia — from the one claimed until the year 2000. In
fact, it accepted the claim qualified as the claim put forward by the inter-
national community when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was for-
mally proclaimed in April 1992. A claim which the relevant international
organizations and States, acting individually or in corpore as members of
organizations, did not however implement either formally or substan-
tively. Instead, they opted for solutions based on pragmatic political con-


                                                         uA)
siderations rather than on considerations under international law. Thus
arose a legal “Rashomon” as to Yugoslavia’s juristic character — was it
a new State or the old State ? And as to its status in the United Nations —
was it a Member of the United Nations or not ?


   78. Yugoslavia’s admission to membership of the United Nations
from 1 November 2000 also meant acceptance of its claim to recognition
as a new State, in the sense of a new international personality different
from its controversial, hybrid personality in the period 1992-2000. The
claim was accepted by way of a series of collateral agreements in simpli-
fied form, or a general collateral agreement in simplified form, between
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on the one hand, and the Member
States of the United Nations and the world Organization itself, on the
other, embodied tacitly in the letter and spirit of General Assembly reso-
lution 55/12 and subsequent consistent practice of the Organization
(exempli causa, the letter of the Under-Secretary-General and Legal
Counsel of the United Nations of 8 December 2000 and the list of Mem-
ber States with the dates of their admission to the United Nations
(United Nations Press Release ORG/1317 updated 18 December 2000).
The subject of the series of collateral agreements, or of the general col-
lateral agreement, is in fact recognition of the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia as a new personality, a personality being the successor State of the
former SFRY, and its admission in that capacity to the world Organiza-
tion as a Member. Thus, Yugoslavia, although the “old State” in the
statehood sense, was universally recognized as a “new State” in the sense
of its international legal personality. In view of the fact that recognition
of a State has ex definitione retroactive effect, it necessarily follows that
all pronouncements and decisions taken relate to the FRY claiming con-
tinuity with the SFRY. And, as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after
the year 2000, its legal existence as a new international legal personality
started in November 2000 with its admission to membership of the
United Nations.



   The second premise, on the other hand, has not been consistently fol-
lowed in relation to the Republic of Montenegro. It has been applied to
parts of the Judgment, but not to the Judgment as a whole. Thus, the
Republic of Montenegro must immediately take effective steps to ensure
full compliance with its obligation under Articles I and VI of the Conven-
tion on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to pun-
ish acts of genocide as defined by Article II of the Convention, or any of
the other acts proscribed by Article III of the Convention, and to transfer
individuals accused of genocide or any of those other acts for trial by the

                          PART II. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES

                 I. Genocide Convention as Applicable Law

1. Genocidal intent as conditio sine qua non of the crime of genocide


   79. A genocidal act can exist only under conditions defined by the
body of law established by the Convention. Acts enumerated in Arti-
cle II, in subparagraphs (a) to (e), are not genocidal acts in themselves,
but only the physical or material expression of specific, genocidal intent.
In the absence of a direct nexus with genocidal intent, acts enumerated in
Article II of the Convention are simply punishable acts falling within the
purview of other crimes, exempli causa war crimes or crimes against
humanity.

   80. Genocide as a distinct crime is characterized by the subjective ele-
ment — intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial and religious group
as such — an element which represents the differentia specifica distin-
guishing genocide from other international crimes with which it shares
substantially the same objective element 41. In the absence of that intent,
whatever the degree of atrocity of an act and however similar it might be
to the acts referred to in the Convention, that act can still not be called
genocide 42.
   81. It appears that four elements are distinguishable within genocidal
intent : (a) the degree of the intent ; (b) destruction ; (c) a national, eth-
nical, racial or religious group ; (d) in whole or in part.
   Although separate, the four elements make up a legal whole character-
izing in their cumulative effect, genocidal intent as the subjective element
of the crime of genocide. The absence of any of them disqualifies the
intent from being genocidal in nature. As a legal unity, these elements,
taken in corpore, demonstrate that genocidal intent is not merely some-
thing added to physical acts capable of destroying a group of people. It is
an integral, permeating quality of these acts taken individually, a quality
that transforms them from simple punishable acts into genocidal acts. In

other words, such intent is a qualitative feature of genocide distinguish-
ing it from all other crimes, indeed its constituent element stricto sensu.


   82. Genocidal intent is genuine in nature. It is not simply a guilty
mind, but a mind guilty of destruction of a religious, ethnic, national or
racial group as such. The distinguishing feature of genocidal intent is not
that it is discriminatory because that is only its most general character-
istic shared with, for instance, crimes against humanity. But, whereas in
the case of persecution, an act of crime against humanity, discriminatory
intent can take multifarious inhumane forms and manifest itself in a mul-
tiplicity of actions, including murder, in the case of genocide, an extreme
and the most inhumane form of persecution, that intent must be accom-
panied by the particular intent to destroy in whole or in part the group to
which the victims belong 43. “Mens rea” in the realm of the crime of geno-
cide is complex and must not be reduced to the standard form of mens
rea required for criminal offences. It encompasses two levels — the mens
rea as the pendant to the actus reus, i.e., an act constituting genocide
pursuant to Article II (subparas. (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)) and the
“intent to destroy” a protected group as such, the specific intent
inherent in genocide. It is therefore rightly stressed that “guaranteeing
the rule of law and the respect for the principle nullum crimen sine lege
require that ‘the two intents’ ought to be strictly separated when it
comes to prove the facts necessary to establish the innocence or guilt
of an accused” 44. In addition, both parts of mens rea are
characterized by the existence of two components — conscience
(la conscience ; Wissen) and will (la volonté ; Wollen). In their various
expressions they offer four different kinds of mens rea, in descending
order of seriousness — dolus specialis, dolus directus, dolus
indirectus (indirect intent) and dolus eventualis (conditional intent),
which, in general terms, correspond to intention, recklessness and
criminal negligence in the common law). Mens rea as the pendant
to the acts constituting the material element — the actus reus — of
the crime should exist in the form of dolus directus. This means
that the perpetrator is conscious of the effect of the act (intellectual
element) and has the will to commit the act (voluntary or emotional
element).

specialis, is at the very top of the hierarchy of culpable mental
states. As such, it excludes culpa, dolus eventualis (recklessness) or
negligence 45. The crime of genocide is “unique because of its element of
dolus specialis (special intent)” 46, which is in fact the constituent
element of the crime of genocide. The degree of dolus specialis means
that it is not sufficient that the accused “knows that his acts will
inevitably, or . . . probably, result in the destruction of the group
in question, but that the accused must seek the destruction in whole or
in part, of a . . . group” 47.

   In other words, special intent is characterized by the voluntary ele-
ment, the purposeful and active will to destroy the protected group.
Knowledge of the natural and foreseeable consequences of the acts
performed is not per se sufficient to constitute the intent to destroy.
It must be accompanied by the desire to destroy the groups ; this is an
additional requirement in the structural sense and a dominant one in the
normative sense. In order for these to be genocide the acts prohibited in
Article II of the Convention must be committed with “intent to destroy,
in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,
as such”.

3. Destruction

  84. Under Article II of the Convention, the expression “to destroy”
means the material (physical and biological) type of genocide. Physical
genocide is addressed in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c), whereas bio-
logical genocide is covered by subparagraph (d).
  In subparagraphs (a) and (c) the matter seems self-evident. Whereas
the act of killing is a clear modus operandi of physical genocide 48, the
expression “physical destruction” employed in subparagraph (c) rules
out the possibility of any interpretation to the effect that infliction on the
group of any conditions of life other than those leading to the physical
destruction of the group may represent an act of genocide. The word
“deliberately” was included there to denote a precise intention, i.e., pre-
meditation related to the creation of certain conditions of life 49. Accord-
ing to the travaux préparatoires, such acts would include “putting of a
group . . . on a regimen of insufficient food allocation, reducing required

medical attention, providing insufficient living accommodation, etc.” 50,
which results in slow death in contrast to immediate death under sub-
paragraph (a) of Article II. The differentia specifica between the act of
killing and the imposing of destructive conditions of life is, consequently,
primarily expressed in the modalities of destruction — the latter case
does not involve the temporal immediacy of killing as the means (modus
operandi) of extermination but does result in extermination over time.

   The legislative history of subparagraph (b) also demonstrates that the
authors of the Convention understood “serious bodily or mental harm”
to be a form of physical genocide. Physical suffering or injury without
lethal consequences falls within the ambit of crimes against humanity and
torture 51. The expression “mental harm”, on the other hand, has a spe-
cific meaning in subparagraph (b). It was included at the insistence of
China. Explaining the proposal by reference to the acts committed by
Japanese occupying forces against the Chinese nation through the use of
narcotics, China pointed out that, although these acts were not as spec-
tacular as mass murders and the gas chambers of Nazi Germany, their
results were no less lethal 52. Accordingly, not every bodily or mental
injury is sufficient to constitute the material element of genocide, but, as
stated by the International Law Commission, “it must be serious enough
to threaten group destruction” 53, as destruction is understood in the
Convention, i.e., physical and biological destruction.


   Acts such as sterilization of women, castration, prohibition of mar-
riages, etc., subsumed under “measures intended to prevent birth within
the group”, constitute biological genocide. The extreme gravity of meas-
ures imposed to prevent births within the group with a view to annihilat-
ing the group’s national biological power is the criterion for differentiat-
ing between the genocidal act defined in subparagraph (b) and measures
which may be taken against the will of members of a group within the
framework of family planning and birth control programmes, measures
which are sometimes descriptively called “genocide by another name” or
“black genocide” 54.

group to another group does not fit into the concept of physical/biologi-
cal genocide as defined in the Convention. However, it should be empha-
sized that the act of forcible transfer of children has been included in acts
constituting genocide with the explanation that it has physical and bio-
logical effects since it imposes on young persons conditions of life likely
to cause them serious harm, or even death 55. In that sense, it is of con-
siderable importance that the proposal to include cultural genocide in the
Convention also has been understood to cover a number of acts which
spiritually destroy the vital characteristics of a group, as observed in par-
ticular in forcible assimilation. The proposal was rejected on a vote of
26 against and 16 in favour with 4 abstentions 56. Hence, it appears rea-
sonable to assume that the underlying rationale of subparagraph (e) is
“to condemn measures intended to destroy a new generation, such action
being connected with the destruction of a group that is to say with physi-
cal genocide” 57. Even if it is accepted that the act covered by subpara-
graph (e) constitutes “cultural” or “sociological” genocide, its meaning
is in concreto of limited importance. Primo, as such it would be an excep-
tion to the rule regarding material genocide embodied in Article II of the
Convention and, therefore, would be subject to restrictive interpretation.
Secundo, the Applicant does not refer to “forcible transfer of children” as
an act of genocide allegedly committed on its territory.

   86. It follows that the difference between the act of killing members of
the group and other acts constituting the actus reus of the crime of geno-
cide is in the modalities rather than in the final effects. In that sense, the
explanation given by the ICTR in the Akayesu case seems proper. It
describes the act defined in subparagraph (c) of Article II of the Geno-
cide Convention as “methods of destruction by which the perpetrator
does not immediately kill the members of the group, but which, ulti-
mately, seek their physical destruction”, 58 i.e., the so-called slow death.

  87. There are two basic legal issues in the interpretation of the word
“destruction” :
(a) whether the destruction must take place in reality, i.e., be actual ;
    and,
(b) the scope of destruction.
   88. Regarding the actual nature of destruction, there is some degree of
difference among the various acts enumerated in Article II of the Con-
vention.

   The act of “killing” implies actual destruction in terms of the proven
result achieved. In that sense, the death of the victim is the essential ele-
ment of the act of killing. Concerning this element, a vast and nearly uni-
form jurisprudence has been developed by both Tribunals, at least declara-
tively, in that, for example, in the Krstić case, the “missing” are treated as
“dead” 59.
   In contrast to killing, acts of serious bodily or mental harm, and acts
of forcible transfer of children, do not imply actual destruction, but a
corresponding result, expressed in grievous bodily or mental harm and
transfer of children respectively, and leading to destruction. In other
words, in these two acts, the required result has a causal connection, in
which the effect is deferred, with destruction.

   The infliction of destructive conditions of life and the imposition of
measures to prevent births, however, do not require any proof of a result ;
they represent, themselves, the result. For the sake of balance, and of
legal security, however, in respect of such acts the intent requirement is
more stringent, since they, unlike the acts for which a specific result is
required, must be undertaken “deliberately” and must be “calculated”, in
the case of infliction of destructive conditions on the group, and must be
“intended” to prevent births, in the case of the imposition of measures.

   89. The intrinsic differences among the acts enumerated in Article II
of the Convention in their relation to the destruction of the protected
group as the ultimate ratio leges of the Convention require a particularly
cautious approach in the determination of the actus reus of the crime of
genocide.
   In contrast to “killing”, all other acts constituting an actus reus of
genocide, falling short of causing actual destruction, merely have the
potential capacity to a greater or lesser extent, to destroy a protected
group. Legally, this makes them more akin to an attempt to commit
genocide. In reality, these acts, therefore, may be seen more as evidence
of intent than as acts of genocide as such. Of course, from the stand-
point of criminal policy, genocide may be characterized as any form
of denial of a group’s right to survive ; the 1948 Convention is indeed
a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, but
still it is a fact that the line between acts short of actual destruction
and attempts to commit genocide may be invisible, especially at the
decision-making time.

   For the proper application of the Law on Genocide, as embodied in
the Convention, acts of genocide, or more precisely the methods and
means of execution of acts of genocide short of actual destruction, must
be evaluated strictly, not only from the subjective but also from the
objective standpoint. The last point of view concerns basically the capa-
bility of a particular action or actions to produce genocidal effects. In
other words, the destructive capacity in terms of material destruction
must be discernible in the action itself, apart from in tandem with the
intention of the perpetrator.



  3.1. Scope of destruction
   90. As far as the required scope of destruction is concerned, two cri-
teria emerged in the emerging case-law of the Tribunals.
   One implies the destruction of the group in terms of the sheer size
of the group and its homogenous numerical composition, the
so-called quantitative approach. As a rule, it is presented in the form
of a “substantial” part, which means “a large majority of the group
in question” 60.
   The second criterion, however, contemplates the destruction of the
elite or of the leadership of the group, which are considered to be of sub-
stantial importance for its existence. For this criterion, it is considered
sufficient “if the destruction is related to a significant section of the
group, such as its leadership” 61.
   Alternatively, the qualitative and quantitative scope of the destruction
cannot possibly fit into the genus proximum of the crime of genocide ;
moreover, it conflicts with the logical considerations. It is not clear how
two by nature diametrically opposite criteria may ensure the sound
administration of justice in the specific case. A possible consequence of
their combined application might merely be the relativization, due to the
disintegration of the constitutive elements of the crime of genocide, of
the protection offered by the Convention to the national, ethnic, reli-
gious or racial groups. The intention to destroy a group is divided, in the
event of the application of both criteria, between the “intention to
destroy a group en masse” and the intention to destroy “a more limited
number of persons selected for the impact that their disappearance
would have upon the survival of the group . . .” 62. Introducing the char-
acterization of genocide, even when the intent to exterminate covers only
a limited geographic area, particularly allows for subjective and arbi-
trary delimitations. It could be said that “this degree of indeterminacy

places genocide on the outermost boundaries of the nullem crimen sine
lege principle” 63.
   In the choice between quantitative and qualitative criteria, it is difficult
to find a reason for giving preference to the qualitative criterion.
   First of all, the criterion of “leadership” is ambiguous and subjective.
It is not clear whether it applies to the political, military or intellectual
elite, or whether it has a generic meaning. It also introduces through the
back door the consideration that the leaders of the group, regardless of
the type of leadership, are subject to special, stronger protection than the
other members of the group, in whole or in part, that they constitute,
which is in fact a distinct subgroup. Moreover, this criterion has an ele-
ment of the concealed promotion of the political group to the status of a
protected object of the Convention — the subsequent division of the
members of the group into elite and ordinary members in modern society
has an anachronistic and discriminatory connotation flagrantly at odds
with the ideas, which represent the bases of the rights and liberties of
individuals and groups. Last but not least, comes understanding part of
the group in terms of its leadership, of which there is no trace in the
travaux préparatoires of the Convention.
   Contrary to the so-called qualitative criterion, the quantitative crite-
rion is characterized by objectivity, which derives from its very nature.
According to the Law of Big Numbers, in its application, it includes, as a
rule, the members of the group to which the qualitative criterion is
applied as a parameter of the intent to destroy. It is also more appropri-
ate to the spirit and letter of the Convention, which takes the group as
such as the ultimate target or intended victim of the crime.

  3.2. The object of destruction

   91. The object of destruction is a “national, ethnical, racial or religious
group as such”. The qualification expresses the specific collective charac-
ter of the crime. It lies within the common characteristics of the vic-
tims — belonging to national, ethnic, racial or religious group — as an
exclusive quality by reason of which they are subjected to acts constitut-
ing actus reus of genocide. The genocide is directed against a number of
individuals as a group or at them in their collective capacity and not ad
personam as such (passive collectivity element). The International Law
Commission expressed the idea by saying that :

      “the prohibited [genocidal] act must be committed against an indi-
      vidual because of his membership in a particular group and as an
      incremental step in the overall objective of destroying the group . . .

Yugoslavia and Rwanda to the Development of Definitions of Crimes against Humanity
and Genocide”, American Society of International Law Proceeding, April 2000, p. 283.


                                                           uA)
       the intention must be to destroy the group ‘as such’, meaning as a
       separate and distinct entity, and not merely some individuals because
       of their membership in a particular group” 64.

  The ICTY determines relevant protected groups as groups that “may
be identified by means of the subjective criterion of the stigmatisation of
the group, notably by the perpetrators of the crime” 65.
  92. The subjective criterion in the determination of a “national, ethnic,
racial or religious” group is one thing, subjectivism is another.

   The subjective criterion as an alternative to, or in combination with the
objective one, is the legal criterion established both in international and
municipal law as regards national, ethnic, religious or racial groups on
the basis of the fact that they roughly correspond “to what was recog-
nized, before the Second World War, as ‘national minorities’” 66. This
includes, as Schabas rightly notes, “races” and “religious groups” 67 whose
meaning has not provoked significant controversies. In relation to ethnic
groups, it is the expression, which, in contemporary usage, seems to
assume the meaning of a synthetic expression for “national minorities”,
“races” and “religious” groups 68. It was applied by the ICTR in the
Akayesu case. The Tribunal found that the Hutus and the Tutsis were
“considered both by the authorities and themselves as belonging to two
distinct ethnic groups” 69.

   In contrast, the “stigmatisation of the group” by the perpetrators of
the crime 70 appears to introduce subjectivism into the determination of
the protected group rather than properly applying the subjective criterion
as such. Its cumulative effects might be characterized as the nullification
of the legal substance of the crime of genocide in one of its constitutive
elements — the element of protected groups — which changes from a
“national, ethnic, racial or religious” group as such into an abstract,
human collectivity determined subjectively. Thus the difference between
the groups protected under the Genocide Convention and those, such as

political groups, which are not considered protected groups, may be lost.
As a consequence, the configuration of international crimes is being
eroded because the physical acts by which war crimes, crimes against
humanity and genocide are committed, are basically the same. Moreover,
personal stigmatization as the criterion for the determining of the pro-
tected group may nullify the objective existence of the “national, ethnic,
racial or religious” group and introduce into the context of the protected
groups, those groups that are excluded from the scope of the Genocide
Convention.
   93. The cumulative negative effects of the stigmatization of the perpe-
trator as the relevant criterion derive from the incongruity, and even
open conflict, of this criterion with the generally accepted legal principles
and cogent legal considerations.

   Primo, the constitutive elements of genocide are a matter of objective
law. As objective law, even regardless of its legal force, they cannot, save
in the event of an explicit provision to the contrary, be determined by the
perpetrator of a crime. It is completely unknown in the province of inter-
national criminal law as well as comparative criminal law for the perpe-
trator of an offence to be in a position to determine the scope of the
offence committed. The scope of an offence is a matter of a norm
of objective law and not of the perpetrator’s personal value-judgment.
The determination of a “national, ethnic, racial or religious” group,
as an element of the crime of genocide in the perpetrator’s personal
value-judgment is in irreconcilable conflict with the very essence of
legal reasoning in the province of criminal law. The qualification
“as such” in the formulation of Article II of the Convention affirms
that the “national, ethnic, racial or religious” group is a matter
of objective reality and not of the personal value-judgment of the
perpetrator.
   Secundo, by a judicial finding based on the perpetrator’s personal
value-judgment, any court of law, in the event of discrepancy between the
subjective criterion of stigmatisation and the “national, ethnic, racial or
religious group” as such, creates a virtual judicial reality at variance with
the objective reality contemplated in Article II of the Convention. More-
over, its possible consequence may be identification as a targeted group —
a group that even does not exist in reality 71.

  Tertio, the subjective criterion alone may not be sufficient to determine
the protected group under the Genocide Convention, for the acts enu-
merated in subparagraphs (a) to (e) of the Convention must be directed
against “members of the group” 72.
  Quatro, in the case of several perpetrators, the criterion of stigmatisa-

tion can easily lead to uneven, substantively different, identifications of
the relevant groups.
   Quinto, the perpetrator’s perception of the “national, ethnic, racial or
religious” group, if inappropriate, creates error in personam which per se
disqualifies genocidal intent. It is a general principle of criminal law
that any person who, while committing a criminal offence, is unaware
that a circumstance is part of the legal elements, does not act
intentionally. Criminal liability for negligent action, however, remains
unaffected.
   Sixto, it confers excessive discretionary powers on the Court. Consid-
ering the nature of the perpetrator’s perception, it might be said that they
go as far as discretio generalis.

   94. The weak points of the subjective criterion are also demonstrated
by the jurisprudence of both Tribunals. In the Brdjanin case the ICTY
stated expressis verbis that “[t]he correct determination of the relevant
protected group has to be made on a case-by-case basis, consulting both
objective and subjective criteria” 73. For instance, the ICTR stated, as the
objective criterion for the identification of Tutsis, the identification cards
indicating ethnic belonging (identification by others) or the subjective cri-
terion of the members of targeted groups (self-identification) 74. Conse-
quently, it is of paramount importance that the subjective criterion, if
applied at all in its “stigmatization” form, must be conceived within the
framework of objective legal standards derived from the letter and spirit
of the relevant provisions of the Genocide Convention respecting stand-
ards established in the corpus of national minorities law.
   95. It appears that the criterion of stigmatisation not only cannot be
the sole criterion ; it cannot even be the primary criterion for the deter-
mination of the “national, ethnic, racial or religious” group within the
framework of the Genocide Convention. It is rather a personal perpetra-
tor’s confirmation of the existence of the protected group, and not its
creation. It is interesting to note that in the case of war crimes and crimes
against humanity, the ICTY applied the objective criterion for the deter-
mination of protected groups 75.
   Basically, the stigmatization of the group understood in that way is of
evidential significance as one of the elements for inference of genocidal
intent.

where the State in whose territory the alleged crime of genocide occurred,
recognizes the existence of these groups as distinct and separate entities,
should be determined on the basis of the criteria established by the inter-
nal law of that State. Or on the basis of international treaties in force to
which the relevant State is a Party. In a way, one is dealing here with a
renvoi or reference of the matter to the internal law of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Both because international law has no generally accepted
precise criteria for the determination of “national, ethnic, racial or
religious” groups and because of the fact that the case concerned actually
invoked entities from the internal law and society of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Or, if not a strict renvoi to internal law, then at least
cognizance of groups that exist under the internal law of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the criteria on the basis of which they have been
determined. One more reason for this is the fact that the ICTY itself,
when it saw fit, relied on domestic law in determining the elements of
international crimes.

   The application of the subjective criterion suffers from objective limi-
tations deriving primarily from the basic meaning of the “national, eth-
nic, racial or religious” group as such. Although the Convention does not
offer an explicit definition of these groups, it appears that the basic mean-
ing of the expressions used is relatively clear. The attributes “national”,
“ethnic”, “religious”, “racial”, although lacking a precise, universally
accepted determination, possess recognizable, generic substance by them-
selves, elaborated to a certain extent also in other international conven-
tions (exempli causa, the International Convention for Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination). The lack of specific distinguishing
marks — differentia specifica — between these four groups, which may
consequently result in their overlapping, cannot have a substantive nega-
tive effect on the proper application of the Genocide Convention, for
their general generic recognizability clearly shows which groups are not
protected under the Convention, or “carries” within itself the exclusion
effect, thus preventing the creation of new protected groups outside the
frame of “national, ethnic, racial or religious” groups. This is clearly
demonstrated just in Bosnia and Herzegovina.


   97. The Applicant asserts that in the present case protected groups
under the Genocide Convention are — the “Bosnian people” (Applica-
tion, Memorial of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2.2.1.2), “mainly Muslim”
(ibid., 2.2.2.1), “Muslim population” (ibid., 2.2.5.13), “national, ethnical
or religious groups (within, but not limited to, the territory of the Repub-
lic of Bosnia and Herzegovina), including in particular the Muslim popu-
lation” (ibid., Submission under (1), non-Serb population (Reply of Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, 7) ; the “People and State of Bosnia and Herze-
govina” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Pro-

   As the protective object of genocide, “national, ethnical, religious or
racial” groups must be precisely determined. The determination require-
ment is of overall significance both in the procedural and in the substan-
tive sense.
