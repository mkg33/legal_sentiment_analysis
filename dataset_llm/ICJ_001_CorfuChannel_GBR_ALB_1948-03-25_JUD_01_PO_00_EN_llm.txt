The above being the state of the proceedings, the Court must now adjudicate upon the Preliminary Objection raised on behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of Albania.

In the written submissions, which it confirmed orally at the hearing on March sth, 1948, the Albanian Government requests the Court

‘’to place on record that the Albanian Government, in accepting the Security Council's recommendation, is only obliged to submit the above-mentioned dispute to the Court in accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the Court”,

and

“to give judgment that the Application of May 13th last, addressed to the Court by the Government of the United Kingdom against the Government of the People’s Republic of Albania, is inadmissible, the Government of the United Kingdom having submitted the said Application contrary to the provisions of Article 40, paragraph I, and Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court”.

The first submission relates to the Resolution of April gth, 1947, in which the Security Council recommended ‘‘that the United Kingdom and Albanian Governments should immediately refer this dispute to the International Court of Justice in accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the Court”. The Albanian Government accepted this recommendation and on the basis of its acceptance recognizes its obligation to refer the dispute to the Court in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. It is true that this obligation could only be fulfilled in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. In recognizing this fact in accordance with the request of the Albanian Government, the Court points out that that Government subsequently contracted other engagements, the date and exact scope of which will be established later.

The second submission of the Albanian Government, which is disputed by the Government of the United Kingdom, appears to constitute an objection on the ground of the inadmissibility of the Application. The intention of the Albanian Government, however, seems to be somewhat lacking in precision in this respect. When it refers, in its submissions, to Article 40, paragraph I, of the Statute of the Court, the Albanian Government appears merely to have in mind a procedural irregularity resulting from the fact that the main proceedings were instituted by means of an application instead of by a special agreement concluded beforehand. The Albanian Government, however, also refers to Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute, a provision which relates exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Court; and the criticisms which are directed against the Application of the United Kingdom in the text of the Preliminary Objection, relate to an alleged lack of compulsory jurisdiction as well as to the formal admissibility of the Application.

This argument may be explained by the connexion which the United Kingdom Government, for its part, had made between the institution of proceedings by application and the existence, alleged by it in this case, of compulsory jurisdiction.

In support of its Application, the Government of the United Kingdom invoked certain provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Statute of the Court to establish the existence of a case of compulsory jurisdiction. The Court does not consider that it needs to express an opinion on this point, since, as will be pointed out, the letter of July 2nd, 1947, addressed by the Albanian Government to the Court, constitutes a voluntary acceptance of its jurisdiction.

The letter of July 2nd, 1947, in spite of the reservation stated therein, the exact scope of which will be considered later, removes all difficulties concerning the question of the admissibility of the Application and the question of the jurisdiction of the Court.

With respect to the first point, the Albanian Government, while declaring on the one hand that it “would be within its rights in holding that the Government of the United Kingdom was not entitled to bring the case before the International Court by unilateral application, without first concluding a special agreement with the Albanian Government’’, states, on the other hand, that ‘“it is prepared, notwithstanding this irregularity in the action taken by the Government of the United Kingdom, to appear before the Court”. This language used by the Albanian Government cannot be understood otherwise than as a waiver of the right subsequently to raise an objection directed against the admissibility of the Application founded on the alleged procedural irregularity of that instrument.

The letter of July 2nd, 1947, is no less decisive as regards the question of the Court’s jurisdiction. Not only does the Albanian Government, which had already assumed certain obligations towards the Security Council by its telegram of January 24th, 1947, declare in that letter that it “fully accepts the recommendation of the Security Council” to the effect that the dispute should be referred to the Court in accordance with the provisions of the Court’s Statute, but, after stating that it is “profoundly convinced of the justice of its case’, it accepts in precise terms “‘the jurisdiction of the Court for this case”. The letter of July 2nd, therefore, in the opinion of the Court, constitutes a voluntary and indisputable acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction.

While the consent of the parties confers jurisdiction on the Court, neither the Statute nor the Rules require that this consent should be expressed in any particular form.

The Albanian contention that the Application cannot be entertained because it has been filed contrary to the provisions of Article 40, paragraph 1, and of Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Court’s Statute, is essentially founded on the assumption that the institution of proceedings by application is only possible where compulsory jurisdiction exists and that, where it does not, proceedings can only be instituted by special agreement.

This is a mere assertion which is not justified by either of the texts cited. Article 32, paragraph 2, of the Rules does not require the Applicant, as an absolute necessity, but only “as far as possible”, to specify in the application the provision on which he founds the jurisdiction of the Court. It clearly implies, both by its actual terms and by the reasons underlying it, that the institution of proceedings by application is not exclusively reserved for the domain of compulsory jurisdiction.

In submitting the case by means of an Application, the Government of the United Kingdom gave the Albanian Government the opportunity of accepting the jurisdiction of the Court. This acceptance was given in the Albanian Government's letter of July 2nd, 1947.

Besides, separate action of this kind was in keeping with the respective positions of the parties in proceedings where there is in fact a claimant, the United Kingdom, and a defendant, Albania.

Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent the acceptance of jurisdiction, as in the present case, from being effected by two separate and successive acts, instead of jointly and beforehand by a special agreement. As the Permanent Court of International Justice has said in its Judgment No. 12, of April 26th, 1928, page 23: “The acceptance by a State of the Court’s jurisdiction in a particular case is not, under the Statute, subordinated to the observance of certain forms, such as, for instance, the previous conclusion of a special agreement.”

The Security Council’s recommendation has been relied upon to support opposite conclusions. But, in the first place, though this recommendation clearly indicates that the bringing of the case before the Court requires action on the part of the parties, it does not specify that this action must be taken jointly, and, in the second place, the method of submitting the case to the Court is regulated by the texts governing the working of the Court as was pointed out by the Security Council in its recommendation.

The Court cannot therefore hold to be irregular a proceeding which is not precluded by any provision in these texts.

The scope of the reservation formulated in the letter of July 2nd, 1947, has still to be considered. The reservation is as follows: “Nevertheless, the Albanian Government makes the most explicit reservations respecting the manner in which the Government of the United Kingdom has brought the case before the Court in application of the Security Council's recommendation and more especially respecting the interpretation which that Government has sought to place on Article 25 of the Charter with reference to the binding character of the Security Council’s recommendations. The Albanian Government wishes to emphasize that its acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction for this case cannot constitute a precedent for the future.”

This reservation is the only limit set by the Albanian Government either to its acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction, or to its abandonment of any objection to the admissibility of the proceedings. It is for the Court to decide, with binding force as between the parties, what is the interpretation of the letter of July 2nd, 1947. It is clear that the reservation contained in the letter is intended only to maintain a principle and to prevent the establishment of a precedent as regards the future. The Albanian Government makes its reservations—both as to the manner in which the United Kingdom Government has instituted the proceedings, and as to the interpretation which that Government claimed to give to Article 25 of the Charter with a view to establishing the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction—not for the purposes of the present proceedings, but in order to retain complete freedom of decision in the future. It is clear that no question of a precedent could arise unless the letter signified in the present case the acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction on the merits.

The reservation in the letter of July 2nd, 1947, therefore does not enable Albania to raise a preliminary objection based on an irregularity of procedure, or to dispute thereafter the Court’s jurisdiction on the merits.

FOR THESE REASONS,

while placing on record the declaration contained in the first submission of the Albanian Government, but subject to the explicit reservation of the obligations assumed by that Government in its letter of July 2nd, 1047,

THE COURT,
by fifteen votes against one,

(1) rejects the Preliminary Objection submitted by the Albanian Government on December gth, 1947 ;

(2) decides that proceedings on the merits shall continue and fixes the time-limits for the filing of subsequent pleadings as follows :

(a) for the Counter-Memorial of the Albanian Government, Tuesday, June 15th, 1948 ;

(6) for the Reply of the United Kingdom Government, Monday, August 2nd, 1948 ;

(c) for the Rejoinder of the Albanian Government, Monday, September 20th, 1948.
