I regret that I am unable to agree with the conclusion arrived at
by the majority of my colleagues. As the matter is of considerable
importance, I think it necessary to give the reasons for my dissent.

There are two unique features in this case—one is the third
condition in the Portuguese Declaration, and the other is that the
Portuguese Application which started this case was filed within
three days of the making of the Declaration and before the pro-
vision contained in the second part of Article 36 (4) of the Statute
of the Court could be complied with. Neither of these aspects has
ever been considered by this Court, and they both raise very
important questions with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court.

Turning to the First Objection of India, it may be readily granted
that the Optional Clause gives the widest freedom to a State which
submits to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. This freedom
is in two respects. A State has the right to define the categories
of disputes which it is prepared to submit to the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court. It may make any reservation it likes and
it may limit the categories to any extent that it desires. The other
respect is that it can limit the time of the pendency of the Declaration.
The Declaration may last two years, one year, six months, or even
it could be terminable on mere notice. But the third condition of
Portugal is an entirely different kind of reservation. It reserves
the right to Portugal to alter and modify the scope of its Declaration
during the pendency of that Declaration.

It was urged by India that this reservation was retroactive and
it was open to Portugal to withdraw a pending litigation by having
resort to this reservation. It is pointed out that the expression
“from the date of the notification” used in the third condition
only indicates the point of time from which the reservation be-
comes effective; it does not refer to its scope or ambit. There is no
limitation placed by Portugal upon the extent of the reservation
and, therefore, it is suggested that Portugal, under this third
condition, reserves to itself the right of withdrawing a pending
litigation before the Court. India is not without support in this
interpretation. The reaction of Sweden to this condition was the
same as India. (See Sweden’s Note to the Secretary-General of
the United Nations dated 23rd February, 1956.) Portugal replied
to this Note by its Note of 5th July, 1956, in which it stated that
this condition did not warrant the conclusion that the Portuguese



Government would be in a position to withdraw from the juris-
diction of the Court any dispute, or category of disputes, already
referred to it. If the reservation is retroactive, then there can be
no dispute that the reservation is bad. On the other hand, it must
be borne in mind that a court must always lean against giving
retroactive or retrospective effect to an instrument, the more so
when such an interpretation is likely to invalidate the instrument
and to deprive a tribunal of its jurisdiction. Even if the language
of the reservation is susceptible of this interpretation, if the other
interpretation is possible, the Court would rather give the inter-
pretation to the instrument which would render it valid and which
would not deprive this Court of its jurisdiction.

But whatever interpretation the Court places upon this condition,
it must be an interpretation based upon the language used in the
instrument itself. No assistance can be sought from the ex post
facto and ex parte statement made by Portugal to which reference
has been made by which it attempted to clarify and elucidate its
own Declaration. No canon of construction is more firmly estab-
lished than the one which lays down that the intention of a party
to an instrument must be gathered from the instrument itself and
not from what the party says its intention was.

But even if no retroactive effect can be given to Portugal's
Declaration, it suffers from a defect, which, in my opinion, is
fatal. Once a reservation is made with regard to categories of dis-
putes which are submitted to the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Court, categories over which the Court has jurisdiction must be
specified and defined. The jurisdiction of the Court with regard to
these categories of disputes must be finally accepted when the
Declaration is made.

It is futile to try and draw a distinction between the Portuguese
reservation and the right to terminate a Declaration at any time.
It was suggested in the course of the arguments that, in the latter
case, a State can put an end to its obligation to submit to the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court with regard to all categories
of disputes, while, in the former case, a more limited right was
reserved by Portugal in that it could only limit the scope of its
obligation. This argument is specious. In the latter case, by ter-
minating the Declaration, the juridical bond between a declarant
State and the other State comes to an end. The State no longer
adheres to the Optional Clause and is not liable to the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court with regard to any matter. In the former
case, the juridical bond continues. In the latter case, both the right
to bring a dispute. before the Court and the obligation to submit
to the jurisdiction of the Court come to an end. In the former case,
the right remains and the State can put an end to the obligation
with regard to any dispute at its own discretion.

Distinguished authors have regretted the continuous decline of
the Optional Clause, and it is the duty of the Court to prevent any



further decline of this Clause. Judge Lauterpacht in the Norwegian
Loans case (I.C.J. Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and
Orders, 1957), when considering the French reservation in that
case, said (p. 64) that it “tended to impair the legal—and moral—
authority and reality of the Optional Clause”, and also (p. 65) that
it “threatens to disintegrate that minimum of compromise which
is embodied in the Optional Clause”. These observations also
apply to the novel reservation embodied by Portugal in her Decla-
ration. Acceptance by Portugal of the compulsory jurisdiction of
the Court is entirely illusory. The minimum of compromise which
is embodied in the Optional Clause is the right given to the State
to limit the categories of disputes which it is prepared to submit
to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court; but any further
derogation from that minimum of compromise should not be
permissible. Once a State, by its Declaration, has expressed its
clear will to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court a
particular dispute, the jurisdiction of the Court with regard to that
dispute must continue so long as the Declaration lasts. As the
intention of the Optional Clause is to make a State accept the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, any reservation which
frustrates that intention must be held to be opposed to the general
purpose of the Optional Clause and therefore invalid.

It was suggested that even if this reservation was invalid, as it
did not affect the present case, it could be severed from the rest
of the Declaration and the rest of the Declaration could be held
valid. The doctrine of severance is well settled in municipal law
and it also applies to international law. If a provision in an instru-
ment is an essential condition, and if the court is satisfied that in
the absence of that ~ssential condition the instrument would not
have been executed, then if the condition is bad, the court is power-
less and the whole instrument must be declared to be invalid.
Otherwise, the court would be writing a new instrument without
the essential condition. In this case there cannot be the slightest
doubt that the reservation we are considering is an essential
condition of Portugal's adherence to the Optional Clause. It is on
this condition that Portugal has agreed to confer jurisdiction upon
the Court. The condition is of the very essence of the submission
of Portugal to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, and if this
condition is invalid, the whole Declaration must be declared to be
invalid.

Both the Objections are based on the fact that Portugal's
Declaration was deposited with the Secretary-General of the United
Nations on the roth December, 1955, and the present Application
was filed on the 22nd December, 1955. I do not think there is any
instance in the history of this Court where a State has filed an
Application with such lightning speed. It is urged on behalf of
Portugal that adherence to the Optional Clause is a unilateral act
by a State and the Declaration comes into force immediately it is
deposited with the Secretarv-General of the United Nations. It
is further pointed out that there is nothing in the Statute or the
Rules of the Court which requires that any time should elapse
between the making of the Declaration and the filing of the Appli-
cation. It is therefore said that although copies of the Declaration
were not transmitted by the Secretarv-General to the Parties to
the Statute nor to the Registrar of this Court, and although India
had no knowledge that any such Declaration had been made by
Portugal, the Declaration became immediately effective, and to
the extent that the same obligations were undertaken by the
Declaration of Portugal and the Declaration of India, India became
liable to be called before the Court in answer to any claim made by
Portugal which fell within the scope of the two Declarations.

The narrow question that we have to consider is whether the
Statute of the Court contemplates that the Declaration should be
immediately effective without knowledge, presumptive or actual,
on the part of the other States who have already adhered to the
Optional Clause—in other words, whether a juridical bond can be
created by a new declarant with the other States who are already
Parties to the Optional Clause by the mere deposit of the Declara-
tion with the Secretary-General so as to entitle the new declarant
immediately to file an Application and bring another State before
the Court. India has contended that by this precipitous Application,
Portugal has violated the principle of equality of States before the
Court, a principle which is the very basis of the Optional Clause.
Portugal, on the other hand, has relied on the letter of the law and
has urged that apart from the reciprocity of obligations at the date
of the Declaration, there is no other reciprocity or equality which
is contemplated by Article 36 (2) of the Statute. Whether the Sta-
tute permits a State to file an Application before the ink on its
Declaration is dry or not, it will be agreed that this is a practice
which should not be countenanced by the Court; and if there is
any provision in the Statute which can permit the Court to refuse
to entertain Portugal's Application, it should do so under the
circumstances of the case.

Article 36 (4) of the Statute consists of two parts: one, making
it incumbent upon a State making a Declaration to deposit it with
the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the second


170 — RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE CHAGLA)

making it incumbent upon the Secretary-General to transmit
copies thereof to the Parties to the Statute and to the Registrar of
the Court. It is common ground that unless the Declaration is
deposited as required by Article 36 (4), the Declaration cannot
become effective. It is difficult to understand why, if the first part
of Article 36 (4) is mandatory, the second part is not equally
mandatory. It is said that the second part is purely administrative
or procedural and it merely gives a direction to the Secretary-

(4). There must have been some reason why the framers of the
Statute inserted this provision in Article 36 (4) and the obvious
reason is that some time should elapse between the making of the
Declaration and the filing of an Application.

It is unnecessary in this case to speculate as to what is the proper
time that should elapse between the making of the Declaration
and the filing of the Application. Sufficient unto the day is the law
thereof: and it will be sufficient to deal only with the facts of this
case. It is clear that in this case an Application has been filed by
Portugal before the second part of Article 36 (4) was complied with,
and it is open to the Court to say that the Application is premature
and that Portugal should have waited until effect had been given
to the provision of the second part of Article 36 (4).

Emphasis has been placed upon the expression ‘“zpso facto” used
in Article 36 (2) of the Statute. It is suggested that this expression
makes it clear that the mere deposit of the Declaration, and nothing
more, brings about the consensual bond between the declarant
State and the State which has accepted the same obligation. The
expression ‘“‘rpso facto” must be read with the words that follow
“and without special agreement”. What the Statute emphasizes
is that apart from the Declaration no special agreement is necessary
to attract the Application of the Optional Clause. Article 36 (2), in
my opinion, does not deal with the question as to when the Decla-
ration becomes effective. For this purpose we have to turn to
Article 36 (4).

There is also force in India’s contention that by the timing of
Portugal's Application, India was deprived of the right to invoke
in her favour the third condition in Portugal's Declaration. It is
now well-settled law that a State which is a Party to the Optional
Clause is entitled to incorporate into its own Declaration any
condition contained in the Declaration of any other State which

reciprocity had been given effect to after France's Declaration
had been filed and the Court did not confine itself to considering
the situation as it existed at the date of France’s Application. The
question that now arises is whether the Court should not look at the
situation as it existed before Portugal filed her Application. And if
the Court comes to the conclusion that India could only have
exercised the third limitation contained in Portugal’s Declaration
before Portugal filed her Application, and if India has been deprived
of that right, then the principle of reciprocity under Article 36 (2)
has been violated. In any view of the case, in my opinion, the



Court should come to the conclusion that the haste with which
Portugal filed this Application has resulted in an abuse of the
Optional Clause and also an abuse of the processes of the Court,
and therefore the Court should refuse to entertain Portugal's
Application.

India’s Third Objection is that the present dispute was brought
before this Court without preliminary diplomatic negotiations and
without the negotiations reaching a deadlock. It is urged by India
that the jurisdiction of the Court is confined to deciding legal
disputes, and before there can be a dispute, it must be clear that
the controversy cannot be settled by negotiations. It is pointed out
that before a State is brought before the bar of the International
Court, every attempt should first be made to see whether the
controversy in question could not be amicably settled. Our atten-
tion has been drawn to the various Notes that were exchanged
between India and Portugal, and it does appear that Portugal
never raised in these Notes the general question of a right of passage
as such. What was discussed in these Notes was certain concrete
questions relating to special situations arising out of disturbances
which had occurred within the Portuguese enclaves; and what
Portugal insisted on was that India had incurred an international
responsibility by its behaviour at a given time and in a specific
situation. Our attention is drawn to the fact that if the general
question of a right of passage had been raised in this diplomatic
exchange of Notes, this Court would have had a better conception
of the right claimed by Portugal. As it is, the Court is not in a
position to know or judge what is the actual nature of the right
claimed by Portugal. Nor had India been given an opportunity
to formulate or express her views with regard to the right claimed
by Portugal before the matter was brought before the Court.
Reliance is placed on the observations of the Court in the Electricity
Company of Sofia and Bulgaria case (P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 77,
p. 132): “What is essential is that, prior to the filing of an Appli-
cation by one Party bringing a dispute before the Court, the other
Party must have been given the opportunity to formulate and to
express its views on the subject of the dispute. Only diplomatic
negotiations will have afforded such an opportunity.”

It is also urged by India that this rule with regard to preliminary
diplomatic negotiations does not operate only in those cases where
there is a provision to this effect in a treaty between the Parties.
The rule is of general application and is based on two considerations:
(I) the need of the Court to know what is the subject-matter of the
dispute, and (2) efforts made by the Parties to reach an agreement
have been fruitless.



There can be no doubt as to the desirability of States negotiating
with regard to a dispute and trying to arrive at a fair solution
before they avail themselves of the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Court. But what we have to consider is whether failure to pursue
this desirable course deprives the Court of its jurisdiction. It is
clear on the authorities that what the Court has insisted upon is
the mere existence of a dispute, and a dispute has been defined as
a divergence of opinions or views between two States: It has also
been held that this divergence is established after one Government
finds that the attitude of the other is contrary to its own. In the
Chôrzow Factory case (Series A, No. 13, p. 10), the Court pointed
out that “it would no doubt be desirable that a State should not
proceed to take as serious a step as summoning another State to
appear before the Court without having previously, within reason-
able limits, endeavoured to make it quite clear that a difference of
views is in question which has not been capable of being otherwise
overcome. But, in view of the wording of the article, the Court
considers that it cannot require that the dispute should have
manifested itself in a formal way; according to the Court's view,
it should be sufficient if the two Governments have in fact shown
themselves as having opposite views.” Therefore, it is clear that the
dispute should not be manifested in any formal way and all that
is necessary is that two Governments should show themselves as
holding opposite views. It has also been observed in the case of
Certain German Interests in Upper Silesia (Series A, No. 6, p. 14):
““… a difference of opinion does exist as soon as one of the Govern-
ments concerned points out that the attitude adopted by the other
conflicts with its own views”. It is difficult to take the view that
the attitude of India on the question of Portugal's claim with
regard to a right of passage does not conflict with the view held
by Portugal. I would therefore overrule this Objection.

Pa

Turning to the Fifth Objection, we heard very learned arguments
as to the burden of proof. In my opinion, now that all the arguments
are before the Court, the question of burden of proof loses much
of its importance. But even so, I should like to say a few words
about it. It is always for a party which comes before a court or
a tribunal to make out a prima facie case that the tribunal or court
has jurisdiction. If that prima facie burden is discharged, it may
be that the burden would shift on to the other party. When India
objects to the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the
subject-matter of the dispute falls exclusively within her domestic
jurisdiction, it would not be correct to describe her attitude as it
has been described by Counsel for Portugal as attempting to obstruct
the normal course of statutory procedure. Undoubtedly the party
coming to the Court has the right to have the benefit of the procedure



provided by the Statute and the Rules for contentious matters.
But that is so only on the assumption that the Court has jurisdiction.
All that India has done is to draw the attention of the Court to the
fact that, looking to her Declaration, the Court has no jurisdiction
over this particular dispute. It is ultimately for the Court to decide
the question of jurisdiction and it is only if the Court takes the
view that the dispute falls within the ambit of India’s Declaration
that the matter can go on and the rules of statutory procedure can
be given effect. It is equally incorrect to say that inasmuch as
India is relying on an exception contained in her Declaration which
confers jurisdiction upon the Court the burden is upon her to make
good that exception. India has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction
with regard to certain categories of disputes, and the particular
category with regard to matters falling exclusively within her
domestic jurisdiction has been excluded. Therefore, it is for Portugal
to establish that the dispute which she has brought before the
Court falls within the scope of India’s Declaration, and she can
only establish that provided she satisfies the Court that the dispute
is not exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of India. The
reservation made by India with regard to matters falling exclusively
within her domestic jurisdiction is not an exception: it is an essen-
tial—an integral-—part of her acceptance of the jurisdiction of the
Court.


I75 RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE CHAGLA)

so. Otherwise it would never be open to a State to take a Preliminary
Objection on this ground. The test has been clearly laid down by
this Court as to what has to be established in order that the Court
will not uphold the Objection at a preliminary stage but would
stand it over to the hearing. Portugal must establish that the legal
grounds relied upon by her justify a provisional conclusion that
they are of juridical importance for a decision of the dispute
according to international law. (See the classical statement of the
law in the Nationality Decrees of Tunisia and Morocco, Series B,
No. 4, p. 25.) To use simpler language, Portugal must show that
her claim discloses an arguable cause of action under international
law. Again, to use a different language, Portugal must show that
the general rule that the subject-matter being within the domestic
jurisdiction of India is within her discretion has been displaced by
some rule of international law.

Now what is the subject-matter of the dispute between Portugal
and India? I will not consider the various metamorphoses which
Portugal’s claim has undergone. But as finally indicated to this
Court it is a right of transit between Daman and the Portuguese
enclaves of Dadra and Nagar-Aveli in order to maintain communi-
cations between Daman and these two enclaves. The first striking
thing about this alleged right is that it is completely indefinite and
vague and, as was described by Counsel for India, “something
undefined and disembodied, hard both to exercise and to enforce”.
When a State comes to this Court claiming a right against another
State, it must be a right which should be enforceable. It must be
a right which, if conceded by the Court, could be given effect to by
the defendant State. No Court would give judgment which could not
be carried out by the losing party. And the most surprising feature
of Portugal's claim in this case is that if she were to succeed in her
contentions, the judgment she would obtain from this Court could
never be given effect to by India. If the Court were to declare that
Portugal has a right of transit over Indian territory from Daman to
the enclaves, it would be impossible for India to know what the
nature, extent or content of that right would be. Would Portugal
be entitled under this right to transport a whole army from Daman
to the enclaves in order to suppress the revolt which has taken place
there? Would she be able to transport tanks and artillery and all
the paraphernalia of modern arms and armaments? Would she be
able to fly aeroplanes over Indian territory in order to bomb the
enclaves in order to reduce them to subjection? Or would the right
be confined to transit facilities to be given to diplomatic envoys or
a small unit in order to maintain law and order in the enclaves?
These queries conclusively establish that Portugal has failed to
formulate any legal right which she can assert against India. It
is only by negotiations which may result in a treaty that the modali-
ties of a right of transit can be settled between India and Portugal.
But the Court cannot be called upon to draft a treaty between these


176 ~~ RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE CHAGLA)

two States. The Court can only pronounce upon an existing right,
and if the right claimed is so insubstantial as to be incapable of
