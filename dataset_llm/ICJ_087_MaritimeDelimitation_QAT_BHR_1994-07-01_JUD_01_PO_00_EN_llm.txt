21. The Court will first enquire into the nature of the texts upon which
Qatar relies before turning to an analysis of the content of those texts.

22. The Parties agree that the exchanges of letters of December 1987
constitute an international agreement with binding force in their mutual
relations. Bahrain however maintains that the Minutes of 25 Decem-
ber 1990 were no more than a simple record of negotiations, similar in
nature to the Minutes of the Tripartite Committee; that accordingly they
did not rank as an international agreement and could not, therefore,
serve as a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court.

23. The Court would observe, in the first place, that international
agreements may take a number of forms and be given a diversity of
names. Article 2, paragraph (1) (a), of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 provides that for the purposes of that
Convention,

“ ‘treaty’ means an international agreement concluded between States
in written form and governed by international law, whether em-
bodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments
and whatever its particular designation”.

Furthermore, as the Court said, in a case concerning a joint commu-
niqué,
“it knows of no rule of international law which might preclude a



joint communiqué from constituting an international agreement to
submit a dispute to arbitration or judicial settlement” (Aegean Sea
Continental Shelf, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1978, p. 39, para. 96).

In order to ascertain whether an agreement of that kind has been con-
cluded, “the Court must have regard above all to its actual terms and to
the particular circumstances in which it was drawn up” (ibid. ).

24. The 1990 Minutes refer to the consultations between the two
Foreign Ministers of Bahrain and Qatar, in the presence of the Foreign
Minister of Saudi Arabia, and state what had been “agreed” between the
Parties. In paragraph 1 the commitments previously entered into are re-
affirmed (which includes, at the least, the agreement constituted by the
exchanges of letters of December 1987). In paragraph 2, the Minutes pro-
vide for the good offices of the King of Saudi Arabia to continue
until May 1991, and exclude the submission of the dispute to the Court
prior thereto. The circumstances are addressed under which the dispute
may subsequently be submitted to the Court. Qatar’s acceptance of the
Bahraini formula is placed on record. The Minutes provide that the
Saudi good offices are to continue while the case is pending before the
Court, and go on to say that, if a compromise agreement is reached
during that time, the case is to be withdrawn.

25. Thus the 1990 Minutes include a reaffirmation of obligations pre-
viously entered into; they entrust King Fahd with the task of attempting
to find a solution to the dispute during a period of six months; and,
lastly, they address the circumstances under which the Court could be
seised after May 1991.

Accordingly, and contrary to the contentions of Bahrain, the Minutes
are not a simple record of a meeting, similar to those drawn up within the
framework of the Tripartite Committee; they do not merely give an
account of discussions and summarize points of agreement and disagree-
ment. They enumerate the commitments to which the Parties have con-
sented. They thus create rights and obligations in international law for
the Parties. They constitute an international agreement.

26. Bahrain however maintains that the signatories of the Minutes
never intended to conclude an agreement of this kind. It submitted a
statement made by the Foreign Minister of Bahrain and dated
21 May 1992, in which he states that “at no time did I consider that in
signing the Minutes I was committing Bahrain to a legally binding agree-
ment”. He goes on to say that, according to the Constitution of Bahrain,
“treaties ‘concerning the territory of the State’ can come into effect only
after their positive enactment as a law”. The Minister indicates that he
would therefore not have been permitted to sign an international agree-
ment taking effect at the time of the signature. He was aware of that situ-
ation, and was prepared to subscribe to a statement recording a political
understanding, but not to sign a legally binding agreement.

27. The Court does not find it necessary to consider what might have



been the intentions of the Foreign Minister of Bahrain or, for that mat-
ter, those of the Foreign Minister of Qatar. The two Ministers signed a
text recording commitments accepted by their Governments, some of
which were to be given immediate application. Having signed such a text,
the Foreign Minister of Bahrain is not in a position subsequently to say
that he intended to subscribe only to a “statement recording a political
understanding”, and not to an international agreement.

28. Bahrain however bases its contention, that no international agree-
ment was concluded, also upon another argument. It maintains that the
subsequent conduct of the Parties showed that they never considered the
1990 Minutes to be an agreement of this kind; and that not only was this
the position of Bahrain, but it was also that of Qatar. Bahrain points out
that Qatar waited until June 1991 before it applied to the United Nations
Secretariat to register the Minutes of December 1990 under Article 102 of
the Charter; and moreover that Bahrain objected to such registration.
Bahrain also observes that, contrary to what is laid down in Article 17 of
the Pact of the League of Arab States, Qatar did not file the 1990 Min-
utes with the General Secretariat of the League; nor did it follow the pro-
cedures required by its own Constitution for the conclusion of treaties.
This conduct showed that Qatar, like Bahrain, never considered the 1990
Minutes to be an international agreement.

29. The Court would observe that an international agreement or treaty
that has not been registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations
may not, according to the provisions of Article 102 of the Charter, be
invoked by the parties before any organ of the United Nations. Non-
registration or late registration, on the other hand, does not have any con-
sequence for the actual validity of the agreement, which remains no less
binding upon the parties. The Court therefore cannot infer from the fact
that Qatar did not apply for registration of the 1990 Minutes until six
months after they were signed that Qatar considered, in December 1990,
that those Minutes did not constitute an international agreement. The
same conclusion follows as regards the non-registration of the text with
the General Secretariat of the Arab League. Nor is there anything in the
material before the Court which would justify deducing from any dis-
regard by Qatar of its constitutional rules relating to the conclusion of
treaties that it did not intend to conclude, and did not consider that it
had concluded, an instrument of that kind ; nor could any such intention,
even if shown to exist, prevail over the actual terms of the instrument in
question. Accordingly Bahrain's argument on these points also cannot be
accepted.

30. The Court concludes that the Minutes of 25 December 1990, like
the exchanges of letters of December 1987, constitute an international
agreement creating rights and obligations for the Parties.

31. Turning now to an analysis of the content of these texts, and of the
rights and obligations to which they give rise, the Court would first
observe that, by the exchanges of letters of December 1987 quoted in
paragraph 17 above, Bahrain and Qatar agreed that

“All the disputed matters shall be referred to the International
Court of Justice, at The Hague, for a final ruling binding upon both
parties, who shall have to execute its terms.”

The same exchanges of letters constituted a Tripartite Committee

“for the purpose of approaching the International Court of Justice,
and satisfying the necessary requirements to have the dispute sub-
mitted to the Court”.

The Parties thus entered into an undertaking to refer all the disputed
matters to the Court and to determine, with the assistance of Saudi
Arabia, the way in which the Court was to be seised in accordance with
the undertaking thus given.

32. The determination of the “disputed matters” was the subject of
lengthy negotiations at meetings of the Tripartite Committee. Those
negotiations were unsuccessful in 1988 and the question was only settled
by the Minutes of December 1990. Those Minutes placed on record the
fact that Qatar had finally accepted the Bahraini formula. Both Parties
thus accepted that the Court, once seised, should decide “any matter of
territorial right or other title or interest which may be a matter of differ-
ence between [the Parties]”; and should “draw a single maritime bound-
ary between their respective maritime areas of seabed, subsoil and super-
Jacent waters”.

33. The formula thus adopted determined the limits of the dispute
with which the Court would be asked to deal. It was devised to circum-
scribe that dispute, but, whatever the manner of seisin, it left open the
possibility for each of the Parties to present its own claims to the Court,
within the framework thus fixed. For example, it permitted Qatar to
present its claims in respect of the Hawar islands, just as it permitted
Bahrain to present its claims in respect of Zubarah. However, while the
Bahraini formula permitted the presentation of distinct claims by each of
the Parties, it nonetheless presupposed that the whole of the dispute
would be submitted to the Court.

34. The Court notes that at present it has before it solely an Applica-
tion by Qatar setting out the particular claims of that State within the
framework of the Bahraini formula. Article 40 of the Court’s Statute,
which provides that cases are brought before the Court “either by the
notification of the special agreement or by a written application”, also
provides that, “In either case the subject of the dispute and the parties
shall be indicated.” These indications are thus requirements common to



both modes of approach to the Court. They are also laid down in the
Rules of Court in Article 38 for cases instituted by application; and in
Article 39 for notification of a special agreement. In the present case the
identity of the parties presents no difficulty; but the subject of the dispute
is another matter.

35. What, then, is “the subject of the dispute” referred to in Qatar’s
Application? That Application only presents the questions which Qatar
would like the Court to decide. Qatar's “requests” in its Application are
thus as follows:

“Reserving its right to supplement or amend its requests, the State
of Qatar requests the Court:

I. To adjudge and declare in accordance with international law

(A) that the State of Qatar has sovereignty over the Hawar
islands; and,

(B) that the State of Qatar has sovereign rights over Dibal and
Qit’at Jaradah shoals;

and

II. With due regard to the line dividing the sea-bed of the two States
as described in the British decision of 23 December 1947, to
draw in accordance with international law a single maritime
boundary between the maritime areas of sea-bed, subsoil and
superjacent waters appertaining respectively to the State of Qatar
and the State of Bahrain.”

36. In argument before the Court it was made abundantly clear by
Bahrain that in its view the Qatar Application comprises only some of
the elements of the subject-matter intended to be comprised in the Bah-
raini formula; in particular there is the omission of any reference to a
dispute over Zubarah to which Bahrain attaches importance, though this
is not the sole subject of its concern. The fact that the subject-matter of
Qatar’s Application corresponds to only part of the dispute contem-
plated by the Bahraini formula was in effect acknowledged by Qatar,
which invited Bahrain to remedy the matter by bringing a separate appli-
cation or a counter-claim respecting, for example. Zubarah.

37. As early as 1983, the Parties, when adopting the “Principles for the
Framework for Reaching a Settlement” (to which reference was made in
the 1987 agreement) had agreed that

“All issues of dispute between the two countries, relating to sov-
ereignty over the islands, maritime boundaries and territorial waters,
are to be considered as complementary, indivisible issues, to be
solved comprehensively together.”

The 1987 agreement provides that “All the disputed matters shall be



referred to the International Court of Justice, at The Hague, . . .”. The
1990 Minutes refer to the “matter” (in the singular) being submitted to
the International Court of Justice; they also refer to the “matter” being
submitted to arbitration. Finally they provide that if the good offices of
the King of Saudi Arabia — which were certainly directed to the whole
of the dispute — were successful, “the case will be withdrawn from arbi-
tration”. The authors of the Bahraini formula conceived of it with a view
to enabling the Court to be seised of the whole of those questions, as
defined by each of the Parties within the general framework thus adopted.

38. The Court has consequently decided to afford the Parties the
opportunity to ensure the submission to the Court of the entire dispute as
it is comprehended within the 1990 Minutes and the Bahraini formula, to
which they have both agreed. Such submission of the entire dispute could
be effected by a joint act by both Parties with, if need be, appropriate
annexes, or by separate acts. Whichever of these methods is chosen, the
result should be that the Court has before it “any matter of territorial
right or other title or interest which may be a matter of difference
between” the Parties. and a request that it “draw a single maritime
boundary between their respective maritime areas of seabed, subsoil and
superjacent waters”. This process must be completed within five months
of the date of this Judgment.

39. On the completion thus of the reference of the whole dispute to the
Court, the Court will fix time-limits for the simultaneous filing of plead-
ings, i.e., each Party will file a Memorial and then a Counter-Memorial
within the same time-limits.

40. The Court notes that Bahrain has attached importance to a matter
which was referred to in Article V of a draft Special Agreement put for-
ward by Bahrain during the 1988 discussions in the Tripartite Commit-
tee, which Article provided:

“Neither party shall introduce into evidence or argument, or pub-
licly disclose in any manner, the nature or content of proposals
directed to a settlement of the issues [to be referred to the Court], or
responses thereto, in the course of negotiations or discussions
between the parties undertaken prior to the date of this Agreement,
whether directly or through any mediation.”

The inclusion of an Article on these lines was objected to by Qatar, and
no such provision appears in the 1990 Minutes. In any event, there is a
rule of customary international law in this domain, defined in 1927 by the



Permanent Court of International Justice, namely that the Court cannot
take account of declarations, admissions or proposals which the parties
may have made in the course of direct negotiations when the negotiations
in question have not led to an agreement between the parties (Factory at
Chorzow, Jurisdiction, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 19; see also Factory
at Chorzôw (Claim for Indemnity), Merits, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 17,
pp. 51, 62-63). The continued existence of the rule was recognized by the
Chamber formed to deal with the case concerning the Land, Island and
Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras: Nicaragua inter-
vening), which commented as follows on the dictum of the Permanent
Court:

“This observation . . . refers to the common and laudable prac-
tice — which, indeed, is of the essence of negotiations — whereby
the parties to a dispute, having each advanced their contentions in
principle, which thus define the extent of the dispute, proceed to ven-
ture suggestions for mutual concessions, within the extent so defined,
with a view to reaching an agreed settlement. If no agreement is
reached, neither party can be held to such suggested concessions.”
