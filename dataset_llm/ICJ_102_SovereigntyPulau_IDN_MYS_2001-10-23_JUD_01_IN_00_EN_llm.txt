19. Both Indonesia and Malaysia argue that the Philippine Applica-
tion should not be granted because of its “untimely nature”.

Indonesia maintains that:

“[i]n view of the fact that the Parties do not consider that there is
any need for further written submissions on the merits of the case
and that the Philippines’ Application was filed after the final submis-
sions of the Parties, the Application should be dismissed as untimely
pursuant to Article 81 (1) of the Rules of Court”.

It considers that the Philippines “has failed to demonstrate that any . . .
exceptional circumstances exist justifying the filing of its Application at
such a late stage of the proceedings”, and concludes that:


20. The Court will consider this objection ratione temporis by apply-
ing the relevant requirements of its Rules dealing with the intervention
procedure to the factual circumstances of the case.

Article 81, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, referred to above (see
paragraph 16), stipulates that:

“[ajn application for permission to intervene under the terms of
Article 62 of the Statute, . . . shall be filed as soon as possible,
and not later than the closure of the written proceedings. In excep-
tional circumstances, an application submitted at a later stage may
however be admitted.”

The Court recalls that the Special Agreement between Indonesia and
Malaysia was registered with the United Nations on 29 July 1998 and
notified to the Court on 2 November 1998. Pursuant to Article 40, para-
graph 3, of the Statute of the Court and Article 42 of the Rules of
Court, copies of the notification and of the Special Agreement were
transmitted to all the Members of the United Nations and other States
entitled to appear before the Court (see paragraph 2 above). Thus, the
Philippines had been aware that the Court had been seised of the dis-
pute between Indonesia and Malaysia for more than two years before it
filed its Application to intervene in the proceedings under Article 62 of
the Statute. By the time of the filing of the Application, 13 March 2001,
the Parties had already completed three rounds of written pleadings as
provided for as mandatory in the Special Agreement — Memorials,
Counter-Memorials and Replies — their time-limits being a matter of
public knowledge. Moreover, the Agent for the Philippines stated dur-
ing the hearings that his Government “was conscious of the fact that
after 2 March 2001, Indonesia and Malaysia might no longer consider



the need to submit a final round of pleadings as contemplated in their
Special Agreement”.

21. Given these circumstances, the time chosen for the filing of the
Application by the Philippines can hardly be seen as meeting the require-
ment that it be filed “as soon as possible” as contemplated in Article 81,
paragraph I, of the Rules of Court. This requirement which, although
when taken on its own might be regarded as not sufficiently specific, is
nevertheless essential for an orderly and expeditious progress of the pro-
cedure before the Court. In view of the incidental character of interven-
tion proceedings, it emphasizes the need to intervene before the principal
proceedings have reached too advanced a stage. In one of the recent
cases, dealing with another type of incidental proceeding the Court
observed that: “the sound administration of justice requires that a request
for the indication of provisional measures . . . be submitted in good time”
(LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America), Provisional Meus-
ures, Order of 3 March 1999, LC.J. Reports 1999 (1), p. 14, para. 19).

27. Article 81, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court provides that an
application for permission to intervene “shall contain a list of documents
in support, which documents shall be attached”. In relation to this
requirement, Indonesia argues in its written observations that

32. In this regard, Malaysia contends that:

“in the present case the jurisdictional link is . . . twice lacking.

First, there is no conventional instrument or unilateral declaration
giving the Court jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the territorial dis-
pute between the Philippines and either one of the Parties to the case;

Second, both Parties in the present case oppose a request for inter-
vention by the Philippines.”

Accordingly, it argues that the Philippine Application cannot be
accepted by the Court.

fying the intervention, the Philippines contends that:

“Under Article 2 of the Special Agreement between the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of Malaysia,
the Court has been requested to determine the issue of sovereignty
over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan ‘on the basis of treaties,

intervention being determined by the language of the submission,
but rather by the possible consequence of the Court’s decision. The
test is not connective, but consequential; not whether there is a ‘con-
nection’ to the submission — whatever that means — but whether
the decision of the Court could affect the interest of a legal nature of
a third State.”

“any claim or title to territory in or islands near North Borneo that
assumes or posits or purports to rest a critical link on the legitimate
sovereign title of Great Britain from 1878 up to the present is un-
founded. Similarly, the interpretation of any treaty, agreement or
document concerning the legal status of North Borneo as well as
islands off the coast of North Borneo which would presume or take


“[The Court] must therefore dismiss this request for intervention
in limine litis, since [its] decision can address only the issue of sov-
ereignty over Ligitan and Sipadan and affect only legal interests with
respect to these two islands. To grant this request for intervention by

Reports 1990, p. 118, para. 61).

56. Thus, the Court will now proceed to examine whether the Philip-
pine claim of sovereignty in North Borneo could or could not be affected
by the Court’s reasoning or interpretation of treaties in the case concern-

Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan.

63. The Court observes, however, that the Philippines must have full
knowledge of the documentary sources relevant to its claim of sover-
eignty in North Borneo. While the Court acknowledges that the Philip-
pines did not have access to the detailed arguments of the Parties as
contained in their written pleadings, this did not prevent the Philippines
