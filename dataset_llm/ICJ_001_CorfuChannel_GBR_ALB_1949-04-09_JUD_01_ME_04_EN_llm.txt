I agree with the opinion expressed in this part of the Judgment,
but I feel compelled to make the observations which follow.

But there is more. Even if some part of Kovacic’'s deposition
was true, his evidence is still not sufficient to prove that the mines
in question were laid by the Yugoslav ships. Kovacic alleged that
he had seen the Yugoslav ships loaded with German GY mines in
the port of Sibenik. He stated that he had heard a Yugoslav
officer (whose name he was unwilling to give) say that the mines
had been laid in Albanian waters ; he added that this officer had
not himself taken part in laying the mines but had merely been told
about it by another officer.

Kovacic’s statement is therefore nothing more than what the
British call ‘’hearsay’’, indeed it is ‘‘hearsay in the second degree’.
Kovacic’s deposition does not, and cannot, afford any kind of proof
in the present case.

However, I doubt whether, by founding oneself on indirect
evidence, it is possible to conclude that a State is responsible vis-a-
vis another State. I do not believe that international justice
could be content with indirect evidence of the sort that has been
produced in the present case, which affects the honour of a State,
a subject of international law, and its position in the community
of nations.

It is not contested that Albania herself had no means of laying
the mines. Neither can it be affirmed that Albania was an
accomplice in the minelaying operation. The assertion of such
complicity would be a departure from juridical logic. If there is
no evidence to show who was guilty of laying the mines, how can
the Court find that Albania was an accomplice in the minelaying
operation ?

It is therefore inequitable to found arguments leading to the conclu-
sion that Albania was cognizant of the minelaying, upon errors
in the Albanian diplomatic correspondence. This consequentia
non valet. Nor is there ground for asserting that Albania sought
to conceal the fact that she was cognizant of the minelaying.
Although she was not informed as to the events on October 22nd,
1946, she did not delay in addressing herself to the United Nations
and in asking them to have these events elucidated.


I employ this term, subject to a reservation. I consider that
the terms of Roman law and of contemporary civil and criminal
law may be used in international law, but with a certain flexibility
and without making too subtle distinctions. There is no need to
transfer the distinctions which we sometimes meet in certain
systems of municipal law into the system of international law.

Here I have an observation to make. The responsibility of a
State in consequence of an international delinquency presupposes,
at the very least, culpa on the part of that State. One cannot
found the international responsibility of a State on the argument
that the act of which the State is accused took place in its territory
—terrestrial, maritime, or aerial territory. One cannot transfer
the theory of risk, which is developed in the municipal law of some
States, into the domain of international law. In order to found the
responsibility of the State recourse must be had to the notion of
culpa. 1 refer to the famous English author, Oppenheim. In
his work on international law, he writes that the conception of
international delinquency presumes that the State acted “wilfully
and maliciously’’, or in cases of acts of omission ‘with culpable
negligence” (Vol. 1, para. 154). Mr. Lauterpacht, the editor of the
7th edition (1948), adds that one can discern among modern authors
a definite tendency to reject the theory of absolute responsibility and
to found the responsibility of States on the notion of culpa (p. 311).

As I have already stated, I cannot find in the organization and
functioning of the Albanian coastal watch—having regard to the
limited resources of that small country—such a lack of diligence
as might involve the responsibility of Albania. I do not find any
evidence of culpable negligence.

I cannot align myself with the opinion of the majority to the
effect that the Court has jurisdiction to determine the amount
of the compensation to be paid by Albania.

The text of the Special Agreement signed by Albania and Great
Britain on March 25th, 1948, is clear. According to that text, the
Court may give judgment on the question of principle : Is there
any duty (for Albania) to pay compensation to Great Britain ?
It does not follow at all that the Court has jurisdiction to fix the
amount of the compensation. In my opinion, that is perfectly
clear, not only from the wording of the Special Agreement, but

The question of innocent passage by warships belonging to one
State through the territorial waters of another State has not been
regulated by convention. The Hague Conference of 1930 for the
Codification of International Law failed in its efforts to regulate
the régime of territorial waters. The practice of States in this
matter is far from uniform, and it is impossible to say that
an international custom exists in regard to it. We only dispose
of scattered sources—suggestions by international associations,
doctrines of learned authorities, etc.

In my opinion, we should adopt the standpoint of the French
writer, M. Gidel, who, in his work Le Droit international public
de la Mer, expresses himself as follows (Vol. 3, p. 284): “The
passage of foreign warships through territorial waters is not a right
but a tolerance.” The reason is that a warship’s character is
different from that of a merchant ship. The celebrated American
jurist, Mr. Elihu Root, in his speech in the North Atlantic Fish-
eries case, judiciously declared that the passage of warships through
territorial waters should not be effected without the consent of the
coastal State. Warships constitute a menace—‘ ‘they threaten”,
that is not the case with merchant ships: “merchant ships may
pass and repass because they do not threaten” (see Hackworth,
Digest of International Law, Vol. I, p. 646). It will be sufficient
to cite in addition the statement on this point in Harvard Law
School Research in International Law (1929, p. 295) : ‘‘There is
therefore no reason for freedom of innocent passage of vessels of
war. Furthermore, the passage of vessels of war near the shores
of foreign States and the presence without prior notice of vessels
of war in marginal seas might give rise to misunderstanding even
when they are in transit.”

the British ships misused the right of passage. Therefore, the
passage of these ships on October 22nd, 1946, ceased to possess the
character of an innocent passage and, for that reason, the sover-
eignty of Albania in her territorial waters was violated.

It may be said that international law is unanimous in condemning
the “right” of intervention in any forms in which this alleged right
may be exercised.

In the present case, a British squadron of twenty-three warships

i.e., their defence of the alleged right of self-help—which is nothing
else but intervention—relies on assertions which have already
been outstripped by the further development of international law,
especially since the ratification of the Charter of the United Nations.


DISSENTING OPINION BY JUDGE KRYLOV 77

Since 1045, i.e., after the coming into force of the Charter, the
so-called right of self-help, also known as the law of necessity
(Notrecht), which used to be upheld by a number of German authors,
can no longer be invoked. It must be regarded as obsolete. The
employment of force in this way, or of the threat of force, is
forbidden by the Charter (para. 4 of Art. 2).

It follows that the action taken by the British Navy in Albanian
waters on October 22nd, 1946, and on November 12th and 13th,
1946, involved the international liability of Great Britain and
must be described as a violation, in international law, of Albania’s
sovereignty.

The statement of that fact constitutes the satisfaction which is
justly due to Albania.
