THE COURT,
composed as above,
after deliberation,
delivers the following Judgment :
1. On 4 May 2006, the Argentine Republic (hereinafter “Argentina”) filed in
   Registry of the Court an Application instituting proceedings against the

 ted that this breach arose out of “the authorization, construction and future
mmissioning of two pulp mills on the River Uruguay”, with reference in par-
ular to “the effects of such activities on the quality of the waters of the River
 uguay and on the areas affected by the river”.
In its Application, Argentina, referring to Article 36, paragraph 1, of the
atute of the Court, seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on Article 60,
ragraph 1, of the 1975 Statute.
2. Pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, the Reg-
rar communicated the Application forthwith to the Government of Uruguay.
  accordance with paragraph 3 of that Article, the Secretary-General of the
nited Nations was notified of the filing of the Application.
3. On 4 May 2006, immediately after the filing of the Application, Argentina
 o submitted a request for the indication of provisional measures based on
 ticle 41 of the Statute and Article 73 of the Rules of Court. In accordance
  h Article 73, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the Registrar transmitted a
 tified copy of this request forthwith to the Government of Uruguay.

4. On 2 June 2006, Uruguay transmitted to the Court a CD-ROM contain-
  the electronic version of two volumes of documents relating to the Argen-
e request for the indication of provisional measures, entitled “Observations
 Uruguay” (of which paper copies were subsequently received) ; a copy of
 se documents was immediately sent to Argentina.
5. On 2 June 2006, Argentina transmitted to the Court various docu-
 nts, including a video recording, and, on 6 June 2006, it transmitted further
cuments ; copies of each series of documents were immediately sent to Uru-
ay.
6. On 6 and 7 June 2006, various communications were received from the


 rties, whereby each Party presented the Court with certain observations on
   documents submitted by the other Party. Uruguay objected to the produc-
 n of the video recording submitted by Argentina. The Court decided not to
 thorize the production of that recording at the hearings.
 7. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of

ch as to require the exercise of its power under Article 41 of the Statute to
dicate provisional measures”.
 9. By another Order of the same date, the Court, taking account of the views
 the Parties, fixed 15 January 2007 and 20 July 2007, respectively, as the time-
mits for the filing of a Memorial by Argentina and a Counter-Memorial by
 uguay ; those pleadings were duly filed within the time-limits so prescribed.

10. On 29 November 2006, Uruguay, invoking Article 41 of the Statute and
 ticle 73 of the Rules of Court, in turn submitted a request for the indication
  provisional measures. In accordance with Article 73, paragraph 2, of the
  les of Court, the Registrar transmitted a certified copy of this request forth-
  h to the Argentine Government.
11. On 14 December 2006, Uruguay transmitted to the Court a volume of
 cuments concerning the request for the indication of provisional measures,
  itled “Observations of Uruguay” ; a copy of these documents was immedi-
  ly sent to Argentina.
12. On 18 December 2006, before the opening of the oral proceedings,
 gentina transmitted to the Court a volume of documents concerning Uru-
ay’s request for the indication of provisional measures ; the Registrar imme-
  tely sent a copy of these documents to the Government of Uruguay.
13. By an Order of 23 January 2007, the Court, having heard the Parties,

ose pleadings. The Reply of Argentina and the Rejoinder of Uruguay were
 ly filed within the time-limits so prescribed.
15. By letters dated 16 June 2009 and 17 June 2009 respectively, the Gov-
nments of Uruguay and Argentina notified the Court that they had come to
   agreement for the purpose of producing new documents pursuant to Arti-
   56 of the Rules of Court. By letters of 23 June 2009, the Registrar informed
   Parties that the Court had decided to authorize them to proceed as they had
reed. The new documents were duly filed within the agreed time-limit.

 16. On 15 July 2009, each of the Parties, as provided for in the agreement
  ween them and with the authorization of the Court, submitted comments on
   new documents produced by the other Party. Each Party also filed docu-
  nts in support of these comments.


17. In accordance with Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the
 urt decided, after ascertaining the views of the Parties, that copies of the
 adings and documents annexed would be made available to the public as
 m the opening of the oral proceedings.
18. By letter of 15 September 2009, Uruguay, referring to Article 56, para-
aph 4, of the Rules of Court and to Practice Direction IXbis, communicated
cuments to the Court, forming part of publications readily available, on
 ich it intended to rely during the oral proceedings. Argentina made no objec-
 n with regard to these documents.
19. By letter of 25 September 2009, the Argentine Government, referring to
 ticle 56 of the Rules of Court and to Practice Direction IX, paragraph 2, sent
w documents to the Registry which it wished to produce. By letter of 28 Sep-
mber 2009, the Government of Uruguay informed the Court that it was
posed to the production of these documents. It further indicated that if,
vertheless, the Court decided to admit the documents in question into the
 ord of the case, it would present comments on them and submit documents
 support of those comments. By letters dated 28 September 2009, the Regis-
 r informed the Parties that the Court did not consider the production of the
w documents submitted by the Argentine Government to be necessary within
   meaning of Article 56, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, and that it had
t moreover identified any exceptional circumstance (Practice Direction IX,
ragraph 3) which justified their production at that stage of the proceedings.

  61, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to Article 72 of the
ules of Court, one of the Parties submitted written comments on a written
ply provided by the other and received after the closure of the oral pro-
edings.

22. In its Application, the following claims were made by Argentina :
    “On the basis of the foregoing statement of facts and law, Argentina,
  while reserving the right to supplement, amend or modify the present
  Application in the course of the subsequent procedure, requests the Court
  to adjudge and declare :
  1. that Uruguay has breached the obligations incumbent upon it under
     the 1975 Statute and the other rules of international law to which that
     instrument refers, including but not limited to :
     (a) the obligation to take all necessary measures for the optimum and
          rational utilization of the River Uruguay ;
     (b) the obligation of prior notification to CARU and to Argentina ;
     (c) the obligation to comply with the procedures prescribed in Chap-
          ter II of the 1975 Statute ;
     (d) the obligation to take all necessary measures to preserve the
          aquatic environment and prevent pollution and the obligation to
          protect biodiversity and fisheries, including the obligation to pre-
          pare a full and objective environmental impact study ;

     (e) the obligation to co-operate in the prevention of pollution and the
           protection of biodiversity and of fisheries ; and
  2. that, by its conduct, Uruguay has engaged its international responsibil-
     ity to Argentina ;
  3. that Uruguay shall cease its wrongful conduct and comply scrupulously
     in future with the obligations incumbent upon it ; and
  4. that Uruguay shall make full reparation for the injury caused by its
     breach of the obligations incumbent upon it.
    Argentina reserves the right to amplify or amend these requests at a sub-
  sequent stage of the proceedings.”
23. In the written proceedings, the following submissions were presented by
 Parties :
 behalf of the Government of Argentina,
the Memorial :
    “For all the reasons described in this Memorial, the Argentine Republic
  requests the International Court of Justice :

  1. to find that by unilaterally authorizing the construction of the CMB
     and Orion pulp mills and the facilities associated with the latter on the
     left bank of the River Uruguay, in breach of the obligations resulting
     from the Statute of 26 February 1975, the Eastern Republic of
     Uruguay has committed the internationally wrongful acts set out in
     Chapters IV and V of this Memorial, which entail its international
     responsibility ;
  2. to adjudge and declare that, as a result, the Eastern Republic of Uruguay
     must :
       (i) cease immediately the internationally wrongful acts referred to
           above ;
      (ii) resume strict compliance with its obligations under the Statute of
           the River Uruguay of 1975 ;


      (iii) re-establish on the ground and in legal terms the situation that
            existed before the internationally wrongful acts referred to above
            were committed ;
      (iv) pay compensation to the Argentine Republic for the damage
            caused by these internationally wrongful acts that would not be
            remedied by that situation being restored, of an amount to be
            determined by the Court at a subsequent stage of these proceed-
            ings ;
       (v) provide adequate guarantees that it will refrain in future from pre-
            venting the Statute of the River Uruguay of 1975 from being
            applied, in particular the consultation procedure established by
            Chapter II of that Treaty.
     The Argentine Republic reserves the right to supplement or amend these
  submissions should the need arise, in the light of the development of the
  situation. This would in particular apply if Uruguay were to aggravate
  the dispute1, for example if the Orion mill were to be commissioned before
  the end of these proceedings.

       See the Order of the Court of 13 July 2006 on Argentina’s request for the indica-
  tion of provisional measures, para. 82.”

the Reply :
     “For all the reasons described in its Memorial, which it fully stands by,
  and in the present Reply, the Argentine Republic requests the Interna-
  tional Court of Justice :
  1. to find that by authorizing
      — the construction of the CMB mill ;
      — the construction and commissioning of the Orion mill and its asso-
           ciated facilities on the left bank of the River Uruguay,
      the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has violated the obligations incum-
      bent on it under the Statute of the River Uruguay of 26 February 1975
      and has engaged its international responsibility ;
  2. to adjudge and declare that, as a result, the Eastern Republic of Uru-
      guay must :
        (i) resume strict compliance with its obligations under the Statute of
            the River Uruguay of 1975 ;
       (ii) cease immediately the internationally wrongful acts by which it
            has engaged its responsibility ;
      (iii) re-establish on the ground and in legal terms the situation that
            existed before these internationally wrongful acts were committed ;
      (iv) pay compensation to the Argentine Republic for the damage
            caused by these internationally wrongful acts that would not be
            remedied by that situation being restored, of an amount to be
            determined by the Court at a subsequent stage of these proceed-
            ings ;
       (v) provide adequate guarantees that it will refrain in future from pre-
            venting the Statute of the River Uruguay of 1975 from being
            applied, in particular the consultation procedure established by
            Chapter II of that Treaty.


     The Argentine Republic reserves the right to supplement or amend these
  submissions should the need arise, in the light of subsequent developments
  in the case.”
 behalf of the Government of Uruguay,
the Counter-Memorial :
     “On the basis of the facts and arguments set out above, and reserving its
  right to supplement or amend these Submissions, Uruguay requests that
  the Court adjudge and declare that the claims of Argentina are rejected.”
the Rejoinder :
    “Based on all the above, it can be concluded that :
  (a) Argentina has not demonstrated any harm, or risk of harm, to the
      river or its ecosystem resulting from Uruguay’s alleged violations of
      its substantive obligations under the 1975 Statute that would be suf-
      ficient to warrant the dismantling of the Botnia plant ;

  (b) the harm to the Uruguayan economy in terms of lost jobs and rev-
       enue would be substantial ;
  (c) in light of points (a) and (b), the remedy of tearing the plant down
      would therefore be disproportionately onerous, and should not be
      granted ;
  (d) if the Court finds, notwithstanding all the evidence to the contrary,
       that Uruguay has violated its procedural obligations to Argentina, it
       can issue a declaratory judgment to that effect, which would consti-
       tute an adequate form of satisfaction ;
  (e) if the Court finds, notwithstanding all the evidence to the contrary,
      that the plant is not in complete compliance with Uruguay’s obliga-
      tion to protect the river or its aquatic environment, the Court can
      order Uruguay to take whatever additional protective measures are
      necessary to ensure that the plant conforms to the Statute’s substan-
      tive requirements ;
  (f) if the Court finds, notwithstanding all the evidence to the contrary,
      that Uruguay has actually caused damage to the river or to Argen-
      tina, it can order Uruguay to pay Argentina monetary compensation
      under Articles 42 and 43 of the Statute ; and
  (g) the Court should issue a declaration making clear the Parties are obli-
       gated to ensure full respect for all the rights in dispute in this case,
       including Uruguay’s right to continue operating the Botnia plant in
       conformity with the provisions of the 1975 Statute.

                                  Submissions

24. At the oral proceedings, the following final submissions were presented
 the Parties :


 behalf of the Government of Argentina,
the hearing of 29 September 2009 :
    “For all the reasons described in its Memorial, in its Reply and in the
  oral proceedings, which it fully stands by, the Argentine Republic requests
  the International Court of Justice :

  1. to find that by authorizing
     — the construction of the ENCE mill ;
     — the construction and commissioning of the Botnia mill and its asso-
          ciated facilities on the left bank of the River Uruguay,
     the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has violated the obligations incum-
     bent on it under the Statute of the River Uruguay of 26 February 1975
     and has engaged its international responsibility ;
  2. to adjudge and declare that, as a result, the Eastern Republic of Uru-
     guay must :
       (i) resume strict compliance with its obligations under the Statute of
           the River Uruguay of 1975 ;
      (ii) cease immediately the internationally wrongful acts by which it
           has engaged its responsibility ;
     (iii) re-establish on the ground and in legal terms the situation that
           existed before these internationally wrongful acts were committed ;
     (iv) pay compensation to the Argentine Republic for the damage
           caused by these internationally wrongful acts that would not be
           remedied by that situation being restored, of an amount to be
           determined by the Court at a subsequent stage of these proceed-
           ings ;
      (v) provide adequate guarantees that it will refrain in future from pre-
           venting the Statute of the River Uruguay of 1975 from being
           applied, in particular the consultation procedure established by
           Chapter II of that Treaty.”
 behalf of the Government of Uruguay,
the hearing of 2 October 2009 :
     “On the basis of the facts and arguments set out in Uruguay’s Counter-
  Memorial, Rejoinder and during the oral proceedings, Uruguay requests
  that the Court adjudge and declare that the claims of Argentina are
  rejected, and Uruguay’s right to continue operating the Botnia plant in
  conformity with the provisions of the 1975 Statute is affirmed.”

                         I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
                        AND FACTS OF THE CASE


. The dispute before the Court has arisen in connection with the
anned construction authorized by Uruguay of one pulp mill and the
nstruction and commissioning of another, also authorized by Uruguay,


  the River Uruguay (see sketch-map No. 1 on p. 33 for the general
ographical context). After identifying the legal instruments concerning
e River Uruguay by which the Parties are bound, the Court will set out
e main facts of the case.


                         A. Legal Framework
26. The boundary between Argentina and Uruguay in the River Uru-
ay is defined by the bilateral Treaty entered into for that purpose at
ontevideo on 7 April 1961 (UNTS, Vol. 635, No. 9074, p. 98). Arti-
 s 1 to 4 of the Treaty delimit the boundary between the Contracting
ates in the river and attribute certain islands and islets in it to them.
 ticles 5 and 6 concern the régime for navigation on the river. Article 7
ovides for the establishment by the parties of a “régime for the use of
e river” covering various subjects, including the conservation of living
 ources and the prevention of water pollution of the river. Articles 8 to
  lay down certain obligations concerning the islands and islets and
eir inhabitants.
27. The “régime for the use of the river” contemplated in Article 7 of
e 1961 Treaty was established through the 1975 Statute (see para-
aph 1 above). Article 1 of the 1975 Statute states that the parties
opted it “in order to establish the joint machinery necessary for the
 timum and rational utilization of the River Uruguay, in strict observ-
ce of the rights and obligations arising from treaties and other inter-
tional agreements in force for each of the parties”. After having thus
fined its purpose (Article 1) and having also made clear the meaning of
rtain terms used therein (Article 2), the 1975 Statute lays down rules
verning navigation and works on the river (Chapter II, Articles 3 to
), pilotage (Chapter III, Articles 14 to 16), port facilities, unloading
d additional loading (Chapter IV, Articles 17 to 18), the safeguarding
 human life (Chapter V, Articles 19 to 23) and the salvaging of property
hapter VI, Articles 24 to 26), use of the waters of the river (Chap-
  VII, Articles 27 to 29), resources of the bed and subsoil (Chapter VIII,
 ticles 30 to 34), the conservation, utilization and development of other
tural resources (Chapter IX, Articles 35 to 39), pollution (Chapter X,
 ticles 40 to 43), scientific research (Chapter XI, Articles 44 to 45), and
rious powers of the parties over the river and vessels sailing on it
hapter XII, Articles 46 to 48). The 1975 Statute sets up the Adminis-
 tive Commission of the River Uruguay (hereinafter “CARU”, from
e Spanish acronym for “Comisión Administradora del Río Uruguay”)
hapter XIII, Articles 49 to 57), and then establishes procedures for
nciliation (Chapter XIV, Articles 58 to 59) and judicial settlement of
 putes (Chapter XV, Article 60). Lastly, the 1975 Statute contains tran-
ional (Chapter XVI, Articles 61 to 62) and final (Chapter XVII, Arti-
  63) provisions.

                      B. CMB (ENCE) Project

 28. The first pulp mill at the root of the dispute was planned by “Celu-
  as de M’Bopicuá S.A.” (hereinafter “CMB”), a company formed by
e Spanish company ENCE (from the Spanish acronym for “Empresa
acional de Celulosas de España”, hereinafter “ENCE”). This mill, here-
after referred to as the “CMB (ENCE)” mill, was to have been built on
e left bank of the River Uruguay in the Uruguayan department of Río
egro opposite the Argentine region of Gualeguaychú, more specifically
  the east of the city of Fray Bentos, near the “General San Martín”
  ernational bridge (see sketch-map No. 2 on p. 35).
 29. On 22 July 2002, the promoters of this industrial project
 proached the Uruguayan authorities and submitted an environ-
ental impact assessment (“EIA” according to the abbreviation used by
e Parties) of the plan to Uruguay’s National Directorate for the
  vironment (hereinafter “DINAMA”, from the Spanish acronym for
Dirección Nacional de Medio Ambiente”). During the same period, rep-
  entatives of CMB, which had been specially formed to build the CMB
 NCE) mill, informed the President of CARU of the project. The Presi-
 nt of CARU wrote to the Uruguayan Minister of the Environment on
  October 2002 seeking a copy of the environmental impact assessment
  the CMB (ENCE) project submitted by the promoters of this indus-
 al project. This request was reiterated on 21 April 2003. On
  May 2003, Uruguay submitted to CARU a document entitled “Envi-
 nmental Impact Study, Celulosas de M’Bopicuá. Summary for public
 ease”. One month later, the CARU Subcommittee on Water Quality
 d Pollution Control took notice of the document transmitted by
  uguay and suggested that a copy thereof be sent to its technical
 visers for their opinions. Copies were also provided to the Parties’
 legations.

30. A public hearing, attended by CARU’s Legal Adviser and its tech-
cal secretary, was held on 21 July 2003 in the city of Fray Bentos con-
rning CMB’s application for an environmental authorization. On
  August 2003, CARU asked Uruguay for further information on vari-
 s points concerning the planned CMB (ENCE) mill. This request was
 terated on 12 September 2003. On 2 October 2003, DINAMA submit-
d its assessment report to the Uruguayan Ministry of Housing, Land
 e Planning and Environmental Affairs (hereinafter “MVOTMA”, from
e Spanish abbreviation for “Ministerio de Vivienda Ordenamiento Ter-
orial y Medio Ambiente”), recommending that CMB be granted an ini-
 l environmental authorization (“AAP” according to the Spanish abbre-
ation for “Autorización Ambiental Previa”) subject to certain condi-
 ns. On 8 October 2003, CARU was informed by the Uruguayan
legation that DINAMA would very shortly send CARU a report on
e CMB (ENCE) project.

31. On 9 October 2003, MVOTMA issued an initial environmental
 thorization to CMB for the construction of the CMB (ENCE) mill. On
e same date the Presidents of Argentina and Uruguay met at Anchorena
olonia, Uruguay). Argentina maintains that the President of Uruguay,
rge Battle, then promised his Argentine counterpart, Néstor Kirchner,
at no authorization would be issued before Argentina’s environmental
ncerns had been addressed. Uruguay challenges this version of the
cts and contends that the Parties agreed at that meeting to deal with the
MB (ENCE) project otherwise than through the procedure under Arti-
 s 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute and that Argentina let it be known that it
  s not opposed to the project per se. Argentina disputes these assertions.


 32. The day after the meeting between the Heads of State of Argentina
 d Uruguay, CARU declared its willingness to resume the technical
 alyses of the CMB (ENCE) project as soon as Uruguay transmitted the
 aited documents. On 17 October 2003, CARU held an extraordinary
enary meeting at the request of Argentina, at which Argentina
mplained of Uruguay’s granting on 9 October 2003 of the initial envi-
nmental authorization. Following the extraordinary meeting CARU
spended work for more than six months, as the Parties could not agree
  how to implement the consultation mechanism established by the
 75 Statute.
 33. On 27 October 2003, Uruguay transmitted to Argentina copies of
e environmental impact assessment submitted by ENCE on 22 July
 02, of DINAMA’s final assessment report dated 2 October 2003 and of
e initial environmental authorization of 9 October 2003. Argentina
acted by expressing its view that Article 7 of the 1975 Statute had not
en observed and that the transmitted documents did not appear
 equate to allow for a technical opinion to be expressed on the environ-
ental impact of the project. On 7 November 2003, further to a request
om the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Uruguay provided
 gentina with a copy of the Uruguayan Ministry of the Environment’s
tire file on the CMB (ENCE) project. On 23 February 2004, Argentina
rwarded all of this documentation received from Uruguay to CARU.

34. On 2 March 2004, the Parties’ Ministers for Foreign Affairs met in
 enos Aires. On 15 May 2004, CARU resumed its work at an extra-
dinary plenary meeting during which it took note of the ministerial
nderstanding” which was reached on 2 March 2004. The Parties are at
ds over the content of this “understanding”. The Court will return to
s when it considers Argentina’s claims as to Uruguay’s breach of its
ocedural obligations under the 1975 Statute (see paragraphs 67 to 158).


35. Following up on CARU’s extraordinary meeting of 15 May 2004,
e CARU Subcommittee on Water Quality and Pollution Control pre-


red a plan for monitoring water quality in the area of the pulp mills
ereinafter the “PROCEL” plan from the Spanish acronym for “Plan de
onitoreo de la Calidad Ambiental del Río Uruguay en Areas de Plan-
  Celulósicas”). CARU approved the plan on 12 November 2004.

36. On 28 November 2005, Uruguay authorized preparatory work to
gin for the construction of the CMB (ENCE) mill (ground clearing).
n 28 March 2006, the project’s promoters decided to halt the work for
  days. On 21 September 2006, they announced their intention not to
 ild the mill at the planned site on the bank of the River Uruguay.



                      C. Orion (Botnia) Mill
 37. The second industrial project at the root of the dispute before the
ourt was undertaken by “Botnia S.A.” and “Botnia Fray Bentos S.A.”
ereinafter “Botnia”), companies formed under Uruguayan law in 2003
ecially for the purpose by Oy Metsä-Botnia AB, a Finnish company.
 is second pulp mill, called “Orion” (hereinafter the “Orion (Botnia)”
 ll), has been built on the left bank of the River Uruguay, a few kilo-
etres downstream of the site planned for the CMB (ENCE) mill, and
 o near the city of Fray Bentos (see sketch-map No. 2 on p. 35). It has
en operational and functioning since 9 November 2007.

38. After informing the Uruguayan authorities of this industrial
oject in late 2003, the project promoters submitted an application to
em for an initial environmental authorization on 31 March 2004
 d supplemented it on 7 April 2004. Several weeks later, on 29
 d 30 April 2004, CARU members and Botnia representatives met
 ormally. Following that meeting, CARU’s Subcommittee on
ater Quality and Pollution Control suggested on 18 June 2004 that
  tnia expand on the information provided at the meeting. On
    October 2004, CARU held another meeting with Botnia
presentatives and again expressed the need for further information
   Botnia’s application to DINAMA for an initial environmental
 thorization. On 12 November 2004, when approving the water quality
onitoring plan put forward by the CARU Subcommittee on Water
uality and Pollution Control (see paragraph 35 above), CARU decided,
  the proposal of that subcommittee, to ask Uruguay to provide further
 ormation on the application for an initial environmental authoriza-
 n. CARU transmitted this request for further information to Uruguay
  note dated 16 November 2004.



39. On 21 December 2004 DINAMA held a public hearing, attended


  a CARU adviser, on the Orion (Botnia) project in Fray Bentos.
 NAMA adopted its environmental impact study of the planned Orion
 otnia) mill on 11 February 2005 and recommended that the initial envi-
nmental authorization be granted, subject to certain conditions.
VOTMA issued the initial authorization to Botnia on 14 February 2005
r the construction of the Orion (Botnia) mill and an adjacent port ter-
 nal. At a CARU meeting on 11 March 2005, Argentina questioned
hether the granting of the initial environmental authorization was well-
unded in view of the procedural obligations laid down in the 1975 Stat-
e. Argentina reiterated this position at the CARU meeting on 6 May
 05. On 12 April 2005, Uruguay had in the meantime authorized the
 arance of the future mill site and the associated groundworks.


 40. On 31 May 2005, in pursuance of an agreement made on
May 2005 by the Presidents of the two Parties, their Ministers for For-
  n Affairs created a High-Level Technical Group (hereinafter the
GTAN”, from the Spanish abbreviation for “Grupo Técnico de Alto
 vel”), which was given responsibility for resolving the disputes over the
MB (ENCE) and Orion (Botnia) mills within 180 days. The GTAN
 ld twelve meetings between 3 August 2005 and 30 January 2006, with
e Parties exchanging various documents in the context of this bilateral
 ocess. On 31 January 2006, Uruguay determined that the negotiations
 dertaken within the GTAN had failed ; Argentina did likewise on
February 2006. The Court will return later to the significance of this
 ocess agreed on by the Parties (see paragraphs 132 to 149).

41. On 26 June 2005, Argentina wrote to the President of the Interna-
 nal Bank for Reconstruction and Development to express its concern
 the possibility of the International Finance Corporation (hereinafter
e “IFC”) contributing to the financing of the planned pulp mills. The
C nevertheless decided to provide financial support for the Orion (Bot-
a) mill, but did commission EcoMetrix, a consultancy specializing in
vironmental and industrial matters, to prepare various technical reports
   the planned mill and an environmental impact assessment of it.
 oMetrix was also engaged by the IFC to carry out environmental
onitoring on the IFC’s behalf of the plant once it had been placed in
 vice.
42. On 5 July 2005, Uruguay authorized Botnia to build a port adja-
nt to the Orion (Botnia) mill. This authorization was transmitted to
ARU on 15 August 2005. On 22 August 2005, Uruguay authorized the
nstruction of a chimney and concrete foundations for the Orion (Bot-
a) mill. Further authorizations were granted as the construction of this
 ll proceeded, for example in respect of the waste treatment installa-
 ns. On 13 October 2005, Uruguay transmitted additional documenta-
 n to CARU concerning the port terminal adjacent to the Orion
otnia) mill.


Argentina repeatedly asked, including at CARU meetings, that the ini-
l work connected with the Orion (Botnia) mill and the CMB (ENCE)
ll should be suspended. At a meeting between the Heads of State of the
rties at Santiago de Chile on 11 March 2006, Uruguay’s President
ked ENCE and Botnia to suspend construction of the mills. ENCE sus-
nded work for 90 days (see paragraph 36 above), Botnia for ten.


43. Argentina referred the present dispute to the Court by Application
ted 4 May 2006. On 24 August 2006, Uruguay authorized the commis-
 ning of the port terminal adjacent to the Orion (Botnia) mill and gave
ARU notice of this on 4 September 2006. On 12 September 2006, Uru-
ay authorized Botnia to extract and use water from the river for indus-
al purposes and formally notified CARU of its authorization on
  October 2006. At the summit of Heads of State and Government of
e Ibero-American countries held in Montevideo in November 2006, the
ng of Spain was asked to endeavour to reconcile the positions of the
 rties ; a negotiated resolution of the dispute did not however result. On
November 2007, Uruguay authorized the commissioning of the Orion
otnia) mill and it began operating the next day. In December 2009, Oy
etsä-Botnia AB transferred its interest in the Orion (Botnia) mill to
PM, another Finnish company.


                                   *
44. In addition, Uruguay authorized Ontur International S.A. to build
d operate a port terminal at Nueva Palmira. The terminal was inaugu-
 ed in August 2007 and, on 16 November 2007, Uruguay transmitted to
ARU a copy of the authorization for its commissioning.

 45. In their written pleadings the Parties have debated whether, in
 ht of the procedural obligations laid down in the 1975 Statute, the
 thorizations for the port terminal were properly issued by Uruguay.
  e Court deems it unnecessary to review the detailed facts leading up to
e construction of the Nueva Palmira terminal, being of the view that
ese port facilities do not fall within the scope of the subject of the dis-
 te before it. Indeed, nowhere in the claims asserted in its Application
 in the submissions in its Memorial or Reply (see paragraphs 22 and 23
 ove) did Argentina explicitly refer to the port terminal at Nueva
 lmira. In its final submissions presented at the hearing on 29 Septem-
r 2009, Argentina again limited the subject-matter of its claims to the
 thorization of the construction of the CMB (ENCE) mill and the
 thorization of the construction and commissioning of “the Botnia mill
 d its associated facilities on the left bank of the River Uruguay”. The
ourt does not consider the port terminal at Nueva Palmira, which lies
me 100 km south of Fray Bentos, downstream of the Orion (Botnia)


ll (see sketch-map No. 1 on p. 33), and is used by other economic
erators as well, to be a facility “associated” with the mill.

46. The dispute submitted to the Court concerns the interpretation
d application of the 1975 Statute, namely, on the one hand whether
 uguay complied with its procedural obligations under the 1975 Statute
 issuing authorizations for the construction of the CMB (ENCE) mill
 well as for the construction and the commissioning of the Orion (Bot-
a) mill and its adjacent port ; and on the other hand whether Uruguay
s complied with its substantive obligations under the 1975 Statute since
e commissioning of the Orion (Botnia) mill in November 2007.


                                     * *
47. Having thus related the circumstances surrounding the dispute
tween the Parties, the Court will consider the basis and scope of its
 isdiction, including questions relating to the law applicable to the
esent dispute (see paragraphs 48 to 66). It will then examine Argenti-
’s allegations of breaches by Uruguay of procedural obligations (see
ragraphs 67 to 158) and substantive obligations (see paragraphs 159 to
6) laid down in the 1975 Statute. Lastly, the Court will respond to the
 ims presented by the Parties in their final submissions (see para-
aphs 267 to 280).

                II. SCOPE OF THE COURT’S JURISDICTION

48. The Parties are in agreement that the Court’s jurisdiction is based
  Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court and Article 60,
ragraph 1, of the 1975 Statute. The latter reads : “Any dispute concern-
g the interpretation or application of the Treaty 1 and the Statute which
nnot be settled by direct negotiations may be submitted by either party
 the International Court of Justice.” The Parties differ as to whether all
e claims advanced by Argentina fall within the ambit of the comprom-
ory clause.

49. Uruguay acknowledges that the Court’s jurisdiction under the
mpromissory clause extends to claims concerning any pollution or type
 harm caused to the River Uruguay, or to organisms living there, in
olation of the 1975 Statute. Uruguay also acknowledges that claims
ncerning the alleged impact of the operation of the pulp mill on the

 The Montevideo Treaty of 7 April 1961, concerning the boundary constituted by the
ver Uruguay (UNTS, Vol. 635, No. 9074, p. 98 ; footnote added).


 ality of the waters of the river fall within the compromissory clause.
n the other hand, Uruguay takes the position that Argentina cannot
 y on the compromissory clause to submit claims regarding every type
 environmental damage. Uruguay further argues that Argentina’s con-
ntions concerning air pollution, noise, visual and general nuisance, as
 ll as the specific impact on the tourism sector, allegedly caused by the
 ion (Botnia) mill, do not concern the interpretation or the application
 the 1975 Statute, and the Court therefore lacks jurisdiction over them.

 Uruguay nevertheless does concede that air pollution which has harm-
  effects on the quality of the waters of the river or on the aquatic envi-
nment would fall within the jurisdiction of the Court.
 50. Argentina maintains that Uruguay’s position on the scope of the
ourt’s jurisdiction is too narrow. It contends that the 1975 Statute was
tered into with a view to protect not only the quality of the waters of
e river but more generally its “régime” and the areas affected by it.
 lying on Article 36 of the 1975 Statute, which lays out the obligation
  the parties to co-ordinate measures to avoid any change in the eco-
gical balance and to control harmful factors in the river and the areas
 ected by it, Argentina asserts that the Court has jurisdiction also with
 pect to claims concerning air pollution and even noise and “visual”
 llution. Moreover, Argentina contends that bad odours caused by the
 ion (Botnia) mill negatively affect the use of the river for recreational
 rposes, particularly in the Gualeguaychú resort on its bank of the
 er. This claim, according to Argentina, also falls within the Court’s
 isdiction.
 51. The Court, when addressing various allegations or claims advanced
  Argentina, will have to determine whether they concern “the interpre-
 ion or application” of the 1975 Statute, as its jurisdiction under Article
  thereof covers “[a]ny dispute concerning the interpretation or applica-
 n of the [1961] Treaty and the [1975] Statute”. Argentina has made no
 im to the effect that Uruguay violated obligations under the 1961
 eaty.
 52. In order to determine whether Uruguay has breached its obliga-
 ns under the 1975 Statute, as alleged by Argentina, the Court will have
 interpret its provisions and to determine their scope ratione materiae.

Only those claims advanced by Argentina which are based on the pro-
 ions of the 1975 Statute fall within the Court’s jurisdiction ratione
ateriae under the compromissory clause contained in Article 60.
 though Argentina, when making claims concerning noise and “visual”
 llution allegedly caused by the pulp mill, invokes the provision of Arti-
   36 of the 1975 Statute, the Court sees no basis in it for such claims.
  e plain language of Article 36, which provides that “[t]he parties shall
-ordinate, through the Commission, the necessary measures to avoid
 y change in the ecological balance and to control pests and other
 rmful factors in the river and the areas affected by it”, leaves no doubt


at it does not address the alleged noise and visual pollution as claimed
 Argentina. Nor does the Court see any other basis in the 1975 Statute
r such claims ; therefore, the claims relating to noise and visual pollu-
 n are manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Court conferred upon it
 der Article 60.


Similarly, no provision of the 1975 Statute addresses the issue of “bad
 ours” complained of by Argentina. Consequently, for the same reason,
e claim regarding the impact of bad odours on tourism in Argentina
 o falls outside the Court’s jurisdiction. Even if bad odours were to be
bsumed under the issue of air pollution, which will be addressed in
ragraphs 263 and 264 below, the Court notes that Argentina has sub-
tted no evidence as to any relationship between the alleged bad odours
d the aquatic environment of the river.

53. Characterizing the provisions of Articles 1 and 41 of the 1975 Stat-
e as “referral clauses”, Argentina ascribes to them the effect of incor-
 rating into the Statute the obligations of the Parties under general
 ernational law and a number of multilateral conventions pertaining to
e protection of the environment. Consequently, in the view of Argen-
 a, the Court has jurisdiction to determine whether Uruguay has com-
ed with its obligations under certain international conventions.

54. The Court now therefore turns its attention to the issue whether its
 isdiction under Article 60 of the 1975 Statute also encompasses obli-
tions of the Parties under international agreements and general inter-
tional law invoked by Argentina and to the role of such agreements
d general international law in the context of the present case.

55. Argentina asserts that the 1975 Statute constitutes the law appli-
ble to the dispute before the Court, as supplemented so far as its appli-
tion and interpretation are concerned, by various customary principles
d treaties in force between the Parties and referred to in the Statute.
 lying on the rule of treaty interpretation set out in Article 31, para-
aph 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Argentina
ntends notably that the 1975 Statute must be interpreted in the light of
 nciples governing the law of international watercourses and principles
 international law ensuring protection of the environment. It asserts
at the 1975 Statute must be interpreted so as to take account of all “rel-
ant rules” of international law applicable in the relations between the
rties, so that the Statute’s interpretation remains current and evolves in
cordance with changes in environmental standards. In this connection
 gentina refers to the principles of equitable, reasonable and non-
urious use of international watercourses, the principles of sustainable
velopment, prevention, precaution and the need to carry out an envi-
nmental impact assessment. It contends that these rules and principles


e applicable in giving the 1975 Statute a dynamic interpretation,
 hough they neither replace it nor restrict its scope.
 56. Argentina further considers that the Court must require compli-
 ce with the Parties’ treaty obligations referred to in Articles 1 and
  (a) of the 1975 Statute. Argentina maintains that the “referral clauses”
ntained in these articles make it possible to incorporate and apply obli-
 tions arising from other treaties and international agreements binding
  the Parties. To this end, Argentina refers to the 1973 Convention on
ternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
ereinafter the “CITES Convention”), the 1971 Ramsar Convention on
etlands of International Importance (hereinafter the “Ramsar Conven-
 n”), the 1992 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity
ereinafter the “Biodiversity Convention”), and the 2001 Stockholm
onvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (hereinafter the “POPs
onvention”). It asserts that these conventional obligations are in addi-
 n to the obligations arising under the 1975 Statute, and observance of
em should be ensured when application of the Statute is being consid-
ed. Argentina maintains that it is only where “more specific rules of the
975] Statute (lex specialis)” derogate from them that the instruments
  which the Statute refers should not be applied.


57. Uruguay likewise considers that the 1975 Statute must be inter-
eted in the light of general international law and it observes that the
 rties concur on this point. It maintains however that its interpretation
 the 1975 Statute accords with the various general principles of the law
  international watercourses and of international environmental law,
en if its understanding of these principles does not entirely correspond
  that of Argentina. Uruguay considers that whether Articles 1 and
  (a) of the 1975 Statute can be read as a referral to other treaties in
rce between the Parties has no bearing in the present case, because con-
ntions relied on by Argentina are either irrelevant, or Uruguay cannot
  found to have violated any other conventional obligations. In any
ent, the Court would lack jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of
 ernational obligations which are not contained in the 1975 Statute.


58. The Court will first address the issue whether Articles 1 and 41 (a)
n be read as incorporating into the 1975 Statute the obligations of the
rties under the various multilateral conventions relied upon by Argen-
a.
59. Article 1 of the 1975 Statute reads as follows :

      “The parties agree on this Statute, in implementation of the pro-
   visions of Article 7 of the Treaty concerning the Boundary Consti-
   tuted by the River Uruguay of 7 April 1961, in order to establish the
   joint machinery necessary for the optimum and rational utilization


   of the River Uruguay, in strict observance of the rights and obliga-
   tions arising from treaties and other international agreements in
   force for each of the parties.” (UNTS, Vol. 1295, No. I-21425,
   p. 340 ; footnote omitted.)
 Article 1 sets out the purpose of the 1975 Statute. The Parties con-
uded it in order to establish the joint machinery necessary for the
  ional and optimum utilization of the River Uruguay. It is true that this
  icle contains a reference to “the rights and obligations arising from
  aties and other international agreements in force for each of the
 rties”. This reference, however, does not suggest that the Parties sought
  make compliance with their obligations under other treaties one of
 eir duties under the 1975 Statute ; rather, the reference to other treaties
mphasizes that the agreement of the Parties on the Statute is reached
  implementation of the provisions of Article 7 of the 1961 Treaty
 d “in strict observance of the rights and obligations arising from
  aties and other international agreements in force for each of the
 rties” (emphasis added). While the conjunction “and” is missing
om the English and French translations of the 1975 Statute, as
 blished in the United Nations Treaty Series (ibid., p. 340 and p. 348),
  s contained in the Spanish text of the Statute, which is the authentic
xt and reads as follows :
      “Las partes acuerdan el presente Estatuto, en cumplimiento de lo
   dispuesto en el Artículo 7 del Tratado de Límites en el Río Uruguay,
   de 7 de Abril de 1961 con el fin de establecer los mecanismos
   comunes necesarios para el óptimo y racional aprovechamiento del
   Río Uruguay, y en estricta observancia de los derechos y obliga-
   ciones emergentes de los tratados y demás compromisos internacion-
   ales vigentes para cualquiera de las partes.” (Ibid., p. 332 ; emphasis
   added.)
The presence of the conjunction in the Spanish text suggests that the
 use “in strict observance of the rights and obligations arising from
 aties and other international agreements in force for each of the
rties” is linked to and is to be read with the first part of Article 1, i.e.,
]he parties agree on this Statute, in implementation of the provisions of
 ticle 7 of the Treaty concerning the Boundary Constituted by the
ver Uruguay”.
60. There is one additional element in the language of Article 1 of
e 1975 Statute which should be noted. It mentions “treaties and
her international agreements in force for each of the parties” (in
 anish original “tratados y demás compromisos internacionales vig-
tes para cualquiera de las partes” ; emphasis added). In the French
 nslation, this part of Article 1 reads “traités et autres engagements
 ernationaux en vigueur à l’égard de l’une ou l’autre des parties”
mphasis added).
The fact that Article 1 does not require that the “treaties and other


 ernational agreements” should be in force between the two parties thus
 arly indicates that the 1975 Statute takes account of the prior commit-
ents of each of the parties which have a bearing on it.
61. Article 41 of the 1975 Statute, paragraph (a) of which Argentina
nsiders as constituting another “referral clause” incorporating the obli-
tions under international agreements into the Statute, reads as follows :
     “Without prejudice to the functions assigned to the Commission
  in this respect, the parties undertake :
  (a) to protect and preserve the aquatic environment and, in par-
       ticular, to prevent its pollution, by prescribing appropriate rules
       and [adopting appropriate] measures in accordance with appli-
       cable international agreements and in keeping, where relevant,
       with the guidelines and recommendations of international tech-
       nical bodies ;
  (b) not to reduce in their respective legal systems :
       1) the technical requirements in force for preventing water pol-
           lution, and
       2) the severity of the penalties established for violations ;
  (c) to inform one another of any rules which they plan to prescribe
       with regard to water pollution in order to establish equivalent
       rules in their respective legal systems.” (Emphasis added.)

62. The Court observes that the words “adopting appropriate” do not
pear in the English translation while they appear in the original Span-
  text (“dictando las normas y adoptando las medidas apropiadas”).
 sing itself on the original Spanish text, it is difficult for the Court to see
w this provision could be construed as a “referral clause” having the
ect of incorporating the obligations of the parties under international
reements and other norms envisaged within the ambit of the 1975
atute.

The purpose of the provision in Article 41 (a) is to protect and pre-
  ve the aquatic environment by requiring each of the parties to enact
  es and to adopt appropriate measures. Article 41 (a) distinguishes
tween applicable international agreements and the guidelines and recom-
endations of international technical bodies. While the former are legally
nding and therefore the domestic rules and regulations enacted and the
easures adopted by the State have to comply with them, the latter, not
ing formally binding, are, to the extent they are relevant, to be taken
 o account by the State so that the domestic rules and regulations and
e measures it adopts are compatible (“con adecuación”) with those
 idelines and recommendations. However, Article 41 does not incorpo-
  e international agreements as such into the 1975 Statute but rather sets
 ligations for the parties to exercise their regulatory powers, in con-
rmity with applicable international agreements, for the protection and


eservation of the aquatic environment of the River Uruguay. Under
 ticle 41 (b) the existing requirements for preventing water pollution
d the severity of the penalties are not to be reduced. Finally, para-
aph (c) of Article 41 concerns the obligation to inform the other party
 plans to prescribe rules on water pollution.



63. The Court concludes that there is no basis in the text of Article 41
  the 1975 Statute for the contention that it constitutes a “referral
 use”. Consequently, the various multilateral conventions relied on by
 gentina are not, as such, incorporated in the 1975 Statute. For that
ason, they do not fall within the scope of the compromissory clause and
erefore the Court has no jurisdiction to rule whether Uruguay has com-
 ed with its obligations thereunder.

64. The Court next briefly turns to the issue of how the 1975 Statute is

 ad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 21, para. 41 ; Kasikili/Sedudu
and (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059,
ra. 18).
The 1975 Statute is also a treaty which predates the entry into force of
e Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In interpreting the terms
 the 1975 Statute, the Court will have recourse to the customary rules
  treaty interpretation as reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Conven-
 n. Accordingly the 1975 Statute is to be “interpreted in good faith in
cordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
 atute] in their context and in light of its object and purpose”. That
 erpretation will also take into account, together with the context, “any
evant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
rties”.
66. In the interpretation of the 1975 Statute, taking account of rele-
nt rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
 rties, whether these are rules of general international law or contained
 multilateral conventions to which the two States are parties, neverthe-
s has no bearing on the scope of the jurisdiction conferred on the


ourt under Article 60 of the 1975 Statute, which remains confined to
 putes concerning the interpretation or application of the Statute.


                                 * *

      III. THE ALLEGED BREACH OF PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS

67. The Application filed by Argentina on 4 May 2006 concerns the
eged breach by Uruguay of both procedural and substantive obliga-
 ns laid down in the 1975 Statute. The Court will start by considering
e alleged breach of procedural obligations under Articles 7 to 12 of the
75 Statute, in relation to the (CMB) ENCE and Orion (Botnia) mill
ojects and the facilities associated with the latter, on the left bank of
e River Uruguay near the city of Fray Bentos.

68. Argentina takes the view that the procedural obligations were
rinsically linked to the substantive obligations laid down by the
75 Statute, and that a breach of the former entailed a breach of the
ter.
With regard to the procedural obligations, these are said by Argentina
 constitute an integrated and indivisible whole in which CARU, as an
ganization, plays an essential role.
Consequently, according to Argentina, Uruguay could not invoke
her procedural arrangements so as to derogate from the procedural
ligations laid down by the 1975 Statute, except by mutual consent.

 69. Argentina argues that, at the end of the procedural mechanism
ovided for by the 1975 Statute, and in the absence of agreement
tween the Parties, the latter have no choice but to submit the matter to
e Court under the terms of Articles 12 and 60 of the Statute, with Uru-
 ay being unable to proceed with the construction of the planned mills
 til the Court has delivered its Judgment.
 70. Following the lines of the argument put forward by the Applicant,
e Court will examine in turn the following four points : the links
tween the procedural obligations and the substantive obligations (A) ;
e procedural obligations and their interrelation with each other (B) ;
hether the Parties agreed to derogate from the procedural obligations
  out in the 1975 Statute (C) ; and Uruguay’s obligations at the end of
e negotiation period (D).

         A. The Links between the Procedural Obligations
                 and the Substantive Obligations
71. Argentina maintains that the procedural provisions laid down in
ticles 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute are aimed at ensuring “the optimum


 d rational utilization of the [r]iver” (Article 1), just as are the provi-
 ns concerning use of water, the conservation, utilization and develop-
ent of other natural resources, pollution and research. The aim is also
 d to be to prevent the Parties from acting unilaterally and without
gard for earlier or current uses of the river. According to Argentina,
 y disregarding of this machinery would therefore undermine the object
 d purpose of the 1975 Statute ; indeed the “optimum and rational
 lization of the [r]iver” would not be ensured, as this could only
  achieved in accordance with the procedures laid down under the
atute.

72. It follows, according to Argentina, that a breach of the procedural
ligations automatically entails a breach of the substantive obligations,
ce the two categories of obligations are indivisible. Such a position is
d to be supported by the Order of the Court of 13 July 2006, according
which the 1975 Statute created “a comprehensive régime”.

73. Uruguay similarly takes the view that the procedural obligations
e intended to facilitate the performance of the substantive obligations,
e former being a means rather than an end. It too points out that Arti-
  1 of the 1975 Statute defines its object and purpose.

 74. However, Uruguay rejects Argentina’s argument as artificial, since
appears to mix procedural and substantive questions with the aim of
eating the belief that the breach of procedural obligations necessarily
tails the breach of substantive ones. According to Uruguay, it is for the
ourt to determine the breach, in itself, of each of these categories of
 ligations, and to draw the necessary conclusions in each case in terms
 responsibility and reparation.

75. The Court notes that the object and purpose of the 1975 Statute,
  forth in Article 1, is for the Parties to achieve “the optimum and
 ional utilization of the River Uruguay” by means of the “joint machin-
y” for co-operation, which consists of both CARU and the procedural
ovisions contained in Articles 7 to 12 of the Statute.
The Court has observed in this respect, in its Order of 13 July 2006,
at such use should allow for sustainable development which takes
count of “the need to safeguard the continued conservation of the river
vironment and the rights of economic development of the riparian
ates” (Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Pro-
 ional Measures, Order of 13 July 2006, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 133,
 ra. 80).
76. In the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros case, the Court, after recalling that
 ]his need to reconcile economic development with protection of the
vironment is aptly expressed in the concept of sustainable develop-
ent”, added that “[i]t is for the Parties themselves to find an agreed
 ution that takes account of the objectives of the Treaty” (Gabčíkovo-


agymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1997,
  78, paras. 140-141).
 77. The Court observes that it is by co-operating that the States con-
 rned can jointly manage the risks of damage to the environment that
  ght be created by the plans initiated by one or other of them, so as to
 event the damage in question, through the performance of both the
 ocedural and the substantive obligations laid down by the 1975 Stat-
 e. However, whereas the substantive obligations are frequently worded
  broad terms, the procedural obligations are narrower and more spe-
fic, so as to facilitate the implementation of the 1975 Statute through a
 ocess of continuous consultation between the parties concerned. The
ourt has described the régime put in place by the 1975 Statute as a
 omprehensive and progressive régime” (Pulp Mills on the River Uru-
 ay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Provisional Measures, Order of 13 July
 06, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 133, para. 81), since the two categories of
  ligations mentioned above complement one another perfectly, enabling
 e parties to achieve the object of the Statute which they set themselves
  Article 1.

78. The Court notes that the 1975 Statute created CARU and estab-
hed procedures in connection with that institution, so as to enable the
rties to fulfil their substantive obligations. However, nowhere does the
75 Statute indicate that a party may fulfil its substantive obligations by
mplying solely with its procedural obligations, nor that a breach of
ocedural obligations automatically entails the breach of substantive
 es.
Likewise, the fact that the parties have complied with their substantive
 ligations does not mean that they are deemed to have complied ipso
cto with their procedural obligations, or are excused from doing so.
oreover, the link between these two categories of obligations can also
  broken, in fact, when a party which has not complied with its proce-
 ral obligations subsequently abandons the implementation of its
anned activity.
79. The Court considers, as a result of the above, that there is indeed
 unctional link, in regard to prevention, between the two categories of
 ligations laid down by the 1975 Statute, but that link does not prevent
e States parties from being required to answer for those obligations
parately, according to their specific content, and to assume, if neces-
ry, the responsibility resulting from the breach of them, according to
e circumstances.

       B. The Procedural Obligations and Their Interrelation
 80. The 1975 Statute imposes on a party which is planning certain
tivities, set out in Article 7, first paragraph, procedural obligations
hose content, interrelation and time-limits are specified as follows in
 ticles 7 to 12 :


                              “Article 7
  If one party plans to construct new channels, substantially modify
or alter existing ones or carry out any other works which are liable
to affect navigation, the régime of the river or the quality of its
waters, it shall notify the Commission, which shall determine on a
preliminary basis and within a maximum period of 30 days whether
the plan might cause significant damage to the other party.

   If the Commission finds this to be the case or if a decision cannot
be reached in that regard, the party concerned shall notify the other
party of the plan through the said Commission.
   Such notification shall describe the main aspects of the work and,
where appropriate, how it is to be carried out and shall include any
other technical data that will enable the notified party to assess the
probable impact of such works on navigation, the régime of the river
or the quality of its waters.
                               Article 8
   The notified party shall have a period of 180 days in which to
respond in connection with the plan, starting from the date on which
its delegation to the Commission receives the notification.
   Should the documentation referred to in Article 7 be incomplete,
the notified party shall have 30 days in which to so inform, through
the Commission, the party which plans to carry out the work.

   The period of 180 days mentioned above shall begin on the date
on which the delegation of the notified party receives the full docu-
mentation.
   This period may be extended at the discretion of the Commission
if the complexity of the plan so requires.
                              Article 9
   If the notified party raises no objections or does not respond
within the period established in Article 8, the other party may carry
out or authorize the work planned.
                              Article 10
   The notified party shall have the right to inspect the works being
carried out in order to determine whether they conform to the plan
submitted.
                              Article 11
   Should the notified party come to the conclusion that the execu-
tion of the work or the programme of operations might significantly
impair navigation, the régime of the river or the quality of its waters,
it shall so notify the other party, through the Commission, within
the period of 180 days established in Article 8.
   Such notification shall specify which aspects of the work or the


  programme of operations might significantly impair navigation, the
  régime of the river or the quality of its waters, the technical reasons
  on which this conclusion is based and the changes suggested to the
  plan or programme of operations.

                                 Article 12
     Should the parties fail to reach agreement within 180 days follow-
  ing the notification referred to in Article 11, the procedure indicated
  in Chapter XV shall be followed.”
81. The original Spanish text of Article 7 of the 1975 Statute reads as
lows :
     “La parte que proyecte la construcción de nuevos canales, la
  modificación o alteración significativa de los ya existentes o la real-
  ización de cualesquiera otras obras de entidad suficiente para afectar
  la navegación, el régimen del Río o la calidad de sus aguas, deberá
  comunicarlo a la Comisión, la cual determinará sumariamente, y en
  un plazo máximo de treinta días, si el proyecto puede producir per-
  juicio sensible a la otra parte.
     Si así se resolviere o no se llegare a una decisión al respecto, la
  parte interesada deberá notificar el proyecto a la otra parte a través
  de la misma Comisión.
     En la notificación deberán figurar los aspectos esenciales de la
  obra y, si fuere el caso, el modo de su operación y los demás datos
  técnicos que permitan a la parte notificada hacer una evaluación del
  efecto probable que la obra ocasionará a la navegación, al régimen
  del Río o a la calidad de sus aguas.”
The Court notes that, just as the original Spanish text, the French
 nslation of this Article (see paragraph 80 above) distinguishes between
e obligation to inform (“comunicar”) CARU of any plan falling within
  purview (first paragraph) and the obligation to notify (“notificar”) the
her party (second paragraph). By contrast, the English translation uses
e same verb “notify” in respect of both obligations. In order to con-
rm to the original Spanish text, the Court will use in both linguistic
rsions of this Judgment the verb “inform” for the obligation set out in
e first paragraph of Article 7 and the verb “notify” for the obligation
  out in the second and third paragraphs.
The Court considers that the procedural obligations of informing,
 tifying and negotiating constitute an appropriate means, accepted by
e Parties, of achieving the objective which they set themselves in Arti-
  1 of the 1975 Statute. These obligations are all the more vital when a
ared resource is at issue, as in the case of the River Uruguay, which can
 ly be protected through close and continuous co-operation between
e riparian States.
82. According to Argentina, by failing to comply with the initial obli-
tion (Article 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Statute) to refer the matter


  CARU, Uruguay frustrated all the procedures laid down in Articles 7
   12 of the Statute. In addition, by failing to notify Argentina of the
ans for the CMB (ENCE) and Orion (Botnia) mills, through CARU,
 th all the necessary documentation, Uruguay is said not to have com-
 ed with Article 7, second and third paragraphs. Argentina adds that
  ormal contacts which it or CARU may have had with the companies
  question cannot serve as a substitute for Uruguay referring the matter
  CARU and notifying Argentina of the projects through the Commis-
  n. Argentina concludes that Uruguay has breached all of its procedural
 ligations under the terms of Articles 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute.
 Uruguay, for its part, considers that referring the matter to CARU
  es not impose so great a constraint as Argentina contends and that the
 rties may agree, by mutual consent, to use different channels by
mploying other procedural arrangements in order to engage in co-
  eration. It concludes from this that it has not breached the procedural
  ligations laid down by the 1975 Statute, even if it has performed them
 thout following to the letter the formal process set out therein.
 83. The Court will first examine the nature and role of CARU, and
 en consider whether Uruguay has complied with its obligations to
  orm CARU and to notify Argentina of its plans.


  The nature and role of CARU
84. Uruguay takes the view that CARU, like other river commissions,
not a body with autonomous powers, but rather a mechanism estab-
hed to facilitate co-operation between the Parties. It adds that the
ates which have created these river commissions are free to go outside
e joint mechanism when it suits their purposes, and that they often do
  According to Uruguay, since CARU is not empowered to act outside
e will of the Parties, the latter are free to do directly what they have
cided to do through the Commission, and in particular may agree not
 inform it in the manner provided for in Article 7 of the 1975 Statute.
 uguay maintains that that is precisely what happened in the present
se : the two States agreed to dispense with the preliminary review by
ARU and to proceed immediately to direct negotiations.


85. For Argentina, on the other hand, the 1975 Statute is not merely
 bilateral treaty imposing reciprocal obligations on the parties ; it
 ablishes an institutional framework for close and ongoing co-op-
ation, the core and essence of which is CARU. For Argentina,
ARU is the key body for co-ordination between the Parties in virtually
  areas covered by the 1975 Statute. By failing to fulfil its obligations
 this respect, Uruguay is said to be calling the 1975 Statute funda-
entally into question.
86. The Court recalls that it has already described CARU as


   “a joint mechanism with regulatory, executive, administrative, tech-
   nical and conciliatory functions, entrusted with the proper imple-
   mentation of the rules contained in the 1975 Statute governing the
   management of the shared river resource ; . . . [a] mechanism [which]
   constitutes a very important part of that treaty régime” (Pulp Mills
   on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Provisional Meas-
   ures, Order of 13 July 2006, I.C.J. Reports 2006, pp. 133-134,
   para. 81).
87. The Court notes, first, that CARU, in accordance with Article 50
 the 1975 Statute, was endowed with legal personality “in order to per-
rm its functions” and that the parties to the 1975 Statute undertook to
ovide it with “the necessary resources and all the information and
cilities essential to its operations”. Consequently, far from being merely
 ransmission mechanism between the parties, CARU has a permanent
 stence of its own ; it exercises rights and also bears duties in carrying
 t the functions attributed to it by the 1975 Statute.

88. While the decisions of the Commission must be adopted by com-
on accord between the riparian States (Article 55), these are prepared
d implemented by a secretariat whose staff enjoy privileges and immu-
 ies. Moreover, CARU is able to decentralize its various functions by
 ting up whatever subsidiary bodies it deems necessary (Article 52).

89. The Court observes that, like any international organization with
al personality, CARU is entitled to exercise the powers assigned
 it by the 1975 Statute and which are necessary to achieve the
ject and purpose of the latter, namely, “the optimum and rational
lization of the River Uruguay” (Article 1). As the Court has pointed
t,
   “[i]nternational organizations are governed by the ‘principle of
   speciality’, that is to say, they are invested by the States which
   create them with powers, the limits of which are a function of
   the common interests whose promotion those States entrust to
   them” (Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in
   Armed Conflict, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 78,
   para. 25).
 is also applies of course to organizations, which like CARU, only have
 o member States.
 90. Since CARU serves as a framework for consultation between the
 rties, particularly in the case of the planned works contemplated in
 ticle 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Statute, neither of them may depart
om that framework unilaterally, as they see fit, and put other channels
 communication in its place. By creating CARU and investing it with
  the resources necessary for its operation, the parties have sought to
ovide the best possible guarantees of stability, continuity and effective-


ss for their desire to co-operate in ensuring “the optimum and rational
 lization of the River Uruguay”.
91. That is why CARU plays a central role in the 1975 Statute and
nnot be reduced to merely an optional mechanism available to the
rties which each may use or not, as it pleases. CARU operates at all
 els of utilization of the river, whether concerning the prevention of
 nsboundary harm that may result from planned activities ; the use of
 ter, on which it receives reports from the parties and verifies whether
e developments taken together are liable to cause significant damage
rticles 27 and 28) ; the avoidance of any change in the ecological bal-
ce (Article 36) ; scientific studies and research carried out by one party
thin the jurisdiction of the other (Article 44) ; the exercise of the right
 law enforcement (Article 46) ; or the right of navigation (Article 48).

 92. Furthermore, CARU has been given the function of drawing up
 es in many areas associated with the joint management of the river and
ted in Article 56 of the 1975 Statute. Lastly, at the proposal of either
 rty, the Commission can act as a conciliation body in any dispute
hich may arise between the parties (Article 58).
 93. Consequently, the Court considers that, because of the scale and
versity of the functions they have assigned to CARU, the Parties
 ended to make that international organization a central component in
e fulfilment of their obligations to co-operate as laid down by the
 75 Statute.

 Uruguay’s obligation to inform CARU
94. The Court notes that the obligation of the State initiating the
anned activity to inform CARU constitutes the first stage in the proce-
 ral mechanism as a whole which allows the two parties to achieve the
 ject of the 1975 Statute, namely, the optimum and rational utilization
  the River Uruguay”. This stage, provided for in Article 7, first para-
aph, involves the State which is initiating the planned activity inform-
g CARU thereof, so that the latter can determine “on a preliminary
sis” and within a maximum period of 30 days whether the plan might
use significant damage to the other party.
95. To enable the remainder of the procedure to take its course, the
rties have included alternative conditions in the 1975 Statute : either
at the activity planned by one party should be liable, in CARU’s
 inion, to cause significant damage to the other, creating an obligation
 prevention for the first party to eliminate or minimize the risk, in con-
 tation with the other party ; or that CARU, having been duly informed,
ould not have reached a decision in that regard within the prescribed
riod.
96. The Court notes that the Parties are agreed in considering that the
o planned mills were works of sufficient importance to fall within the
ope of Article 7 of the 1975 Statute, and thus for CARU to have been


 ormed of them. The same applies to the plan to construct a port ter-
 nal at Fray Bentos for the exclusive use of the Orion (Botnia) mill,
hich included dredging work and use of the river bed.

 97. However, the Court observes that the Parties disagree on whether
ere is an obligation to inform CARU in respect of the extraction and
e of water from the river for industrial purposes by the Orion (Botnia)
 ll. Argentina takes the view that the authorization granted by the Uru-
 ayan Ministry of Transport and Public Works on 12 September 2006
ncerns an activity of sufficient importance (“entidad suficiente”) to
 ect the régime of the river or the quality of its waters and that, in this
atter, Uruguay should have followed the procedure laid down in Arti-
 s 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute. For its part, Uruguay maintains that this
tivity forms an integral part of the Orion (Botnia) mill project as a
hole, and that the 1975 Statute does not require CARU to be informed
 each step in furtherance of the planned works.
 98. The Court points out that while the Parties are agreed in recogniz-
g that CARU should have been informed of the two planned mills and
e plan to construct the port terminal at Fray Bentos, they nonetheless
 fer as regards the content of the information which should be provided
 CARU and as to when this should take place.
 99. Argentina has argued that the content of the obligation to inform
ust be determined in the light of its objective, which is to prevent
reats to navigation, the régime of the river or the quality of the waters.
 cording to Argentina, the plan which CARU must be informed of may
  at a very early stage, since it is simply a matter of allowing the Com-
 ssion to “determine on a preliminary basis”, within a very short period
 30 days, whether the plan “might cause significant damage to the other
 rty”. It is only in the following phase of the procedure that the sub-
 nce of the obligation to inform is said to become more extensive. In
 gentina’s view, however, CARU must be informed prior to the authori-
tion or implementation of a project on the River Uruguay.
 100. Citing the terms of Article 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Statute,
 uguay gives a different interpretation of it, taking the view that the
quirement to inform CARU specified by this provision cannot occur in
e very early stages of planning, because there could not be sufficient
 ormation available to the Commission for it to determine whether or
 t the plan might cause significant damage to the other State. For that,
cording to Uruguay, the project would have to have reached a stage
here all the technical data on it are available. As the Court will consider
rther below, Uruguay seeks to link the content of the information to
e time when it should be provided, which may even be after the State
ncerned has granted an initial environmental authorization.
 101. The Court points out that the principle of prevention, as a cus-
mary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State
 its territory. It is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its
 ritory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States” (Corfu


 annel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
49, p. 22). A State is thus obliged to use all the means at its disposal in
der to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area
 der its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of
 other State. This Court has established that this obligation “is now
 rt of the corpus of international law relating to the environment”
egality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion,
C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 242, para. 29).

102. In the view of the Court, the obligation to inform CARU allows
r the initiation of co-operation between the Parties which is necessary
 order to fulfil the obligation of prevention. This first procedural stage
 ults in the 1975 Statute not being applied to activities which would
 pear to cause damage only to the State in whose territory they are car-
 d out.
103. The Court observes that with regard to the River Uruguay, which
nstitutes a shared resource, “significant damage to the other party”
 rticle 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Statute) may result from impair-
ent of navigation, the régime of the river or the quality of its waters.
oreover, Article 27 of the 1975 Statute stipulates that :
   “[t]he right of each party to use the waters of the river, within its
   jurisdiction, for domestic, sanitary, industrial and agricultural pur-
   poses shall be exercised without prejudice to the application of the
   procedure laid down in Articles 7 to 12 when the use is liable to
   affect the régime of the river or the quality of its waters”.

104. The Court notes that, in accordance with the terms of Article 7,
st paragraph, the information which must be provided to CARU, at
 s initial stage of the procedure, has to enable it to determine swiftly
d on a preliminary basis whether the plan might cause significant dam-
e to the other party. For CARU, at this stage, it is a question of decid-
g whether or not the plan falls under the co-operation procedure laid
 wn by the 1975 Statute, and not of pronouncing on its actual impact
  the river and the quality of its waters. This explains, in the opinion of
e Court, the difference between the terminology of the first paragraph
 Article 7, concerning the requirement to inform CARU, and that of
e third paragraph, concerning the content of the notification to be
dressed to the other party at a later stage, enabling it “to assess the
obable impact of such works on navigation, the régime of the river or
e quality of its waters”.
105. The Court considers that the State planning activities referred to
 Article 7 of the Statute is required to inform CARU as soon as it is in
 ssession of a plan which is sufficiently developed to enable CARU to
ake the preliminary assessment (required by paragraph 1 of that provi-
 n) of whether the proposed works might cause significant damage to
e other party. At that stage, the information provided will not neces-


rily consist of a full assessment of the environmental impact of the
oject, which will often require further time and resources, although,
here more complete information is available, this should, of course, be
  nsmitted to CARU to give it the best possible basis on which to make
  preliminary assessment. In any event, the duty to inform CARU will
come applicable at the stage when the relevant authority has had the
oject referred to it with the aim of obtaining initial environmental
 thorization and before the granting of that authorization.
 106. The Court observes that, in the present case, Uruguay did not
  nsmit to CARU the information required by Article 7, first paragraph,
  respect of the CMB (ENCE) and Orion (Botnia) mills, despite the
quests made to it by the Commission to that effect on several occa-
  ns, in particular on 17 October 2002 and 21 April 2003 with regard to
e CMB (ENCE) mill, and on 16 November 2004 with regard to the
 ion (Botnia) mill. Uruguay merely sent CARU, on 14 May 2003, a
mmary for public release of the environmental impact assessment for
e CMB (ENCE) mill. CARU considered this document to be inad-
uate and again requested further information from Uruguay on
  August 2003 and 12 September 2003. Moreover, Uruguay did not
  nsmit any document to CARU regarding the Orion (Botnia) mill.
onsequently, Uruguay issued the initial environmental authorizations
  CMB on 9 October 2003 and to Botnia on 14 February 2005 without
mplying with the procedure laid down in Article 7, first paragraph.
  uguay therefore came to a decision on the environmental impact of the
ojects without involving CARU, thereby simply giving effect to Arti-
  17, third paragraph, of Uruguayan Decree No. 435/994 of 21 Septem-
r 1994, Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation, according to
hich the Ministry of Housing, Land Use Planning and Environmental
 fairs may grant the initial environmental authorization provided that
e adverse environmental impacts of the project remain within accept-
 le limits.
 107. The Court further notes that on 12 April 2005 Uruguay granted
  authorization to Botnia for the first phase of the construction of the
 ion (Botnia) mill and, on 5 July 2005, an authorization to construct
 port terminal for its exclusive use and to utilize the river bed for
dustrial purposes, without informing CARU of these projects in
 vance.
 108. With regard to the extraction and use of water from the river, of
hich CARU should have first been informed, according to Argentina,
e Court takes the view that this is an activity which forms an integral
 rt of the commissioning of the Orion (Botnia) mill and therefore did
 t require a separate referral to CARU.
 109. However, Uruguay maintains that CARU was made aware of the
ans for the mills by representatives of ENCE on 8 July 2002, and no
 er than 29 April 2004 by representatives of Botnia, before the initial
vironmental authorizations were issued. Argentina, for its part, consid-
   that these so-called private dealings, whatever form they may have


ken, do not constitute performance of the obligation imposed on the
rties by Article 7, first paragraph.
110. The Court considers that the information on the plans for the
lls which reached CARU via the companies concerned or from other
n-governmental sources cannot substitute for the obligation to inform
d down in Article 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Statute, which is
rne by the party planning to construct the works referred to in that
ovision. Similarly, in the case concerning Certain Questions of Mutual
 sistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), the Court observed
at
  “[i]f the information eventually came to Djibouti through the press,
  the information disseminated in this way could not be taken into
  account for the purposes of the application of Article 17 [of the Con-
  vention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the two
  countries, providing that ‘[r]easons shall be given for any refusal of
  mutual assistance’]” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 231,
  para. 150).
111. Consequently, the Court concludes from the above that Uruguay,
 not informing CARU of the planned works before the issuing of the
tial environmental authorizations for each of the mills and for the port
 minal adjacent to the Orion (Botnia) mill, has failed to comply with
e obligation imposed on it by Article 7, first paragraph, of the 1975 Stat-
e.

 Uruguay’s obligation to notify the plans to the other party
112. The Court notes that, under the terms of Article 7, second para-
aph, of the 1975 Statute, if CARU decides that the plan might cause
 nificant damage to the other party or if a decision cannot be reached in
at regard, “the party concerned shall notify the other party of this plan
rough the said Commission”.
Article 7, third paragraph, of the 1975 Statute sets out in detail the
ntent of this notification, which
  “shall describe the main aspects of the work and . . . any other tech-
  nical data that will enable the notified party to assess the probable
  impact of such works on navigation, the régime of the river or the
  quality of its waters”.
113. In the opinion of the Court, the obligation to notify is intended to
eate the conditions for successful co-operation between the parties, ena-
 ng them to assess the plan’s impact on the river on the basis of the
 lest possible information and, if necessary, to negotiate the adjust-
ents needed to avoid the potential damage that it might cause.

114. Article 8 stipulates a period of 180 days, which may be extended
 the Commission, for the notified party to respond in connection with


e plan, subject to it requesting the other party, through the Commis-
 n, to supplement as necessary the documentation it has provided.

If the notified party raises no objections, the other party may carry out
 authorize the work (Article 9). Otherwise, the former must notify the
ter of those aspects of the work which may cause it damage and of the
ggested changes (Article 11), thereby opening a further 180-day period
 negotiation in which to reach an agreement (Article 12).


 115. The obligation to notify is therefore an essential part of the proc-
  leading the parties to consult in order to assess the risks of the plan
 d to negotiate possible changes which may eliminate those risks or
 nimize their effects.
 116. The Parties agree on the need for a full environmental impact
sessment in order to assess any significant damage which might be
used by a plan.
 117. Uruguay takes the view that such assessments were carried out in
cordance with its legislation (Decree No. 435/994 of 21 September 1994,
 vironmental Impact Assessment Regulation), submitted to DINAMA
r consideration and transmitted to Argentina on 7 November 2003 in
e case of the CMB (ENCE) project and on 19 August 2005 for the
 ion (Botnia) project. According to Uruguay, DINAMA asked the
mpanies concerned for all the additional information that was required
 supplement the original environmental impact assessments submitted
 it, and only when it was satisfied did it propose to the Ministry of the
 vironment that the initial environmental authorizations requested
ould be issued, which they were to CMB on 9 October 2003 and to
 tnia on 14 February 2005.
 Uruguay maintains that it was not required to transmit the environ-
ental impact assessments to Argentina before issuing the initial environ-
ental authorizations to the companies, these authorizations having
en adopted on the basis of its legislation on the subject.
 118. Argentina, for its part, first points out that the environmental
 pact assessments transmitted to it by Uruguay were incomplete, par-
 ularly in that they made no provision for alternative sites for the mills
 d failed to include any consultation of the affected populations. The
ourt will return later in the Judgment to the substantive conditions
hich must be met by environmental impact assessments (see para-
aphs 203 to 219).
 Furthermore, in procedural terms, Argentina considers that the initial
vironmental authorizations should not have been granted to the com-
 nies before it had received the complete environmental impact assess-
ents, and that it was unable to exercise its rights in this context under
 ticles 7 to 11 of the 1975 Statute.
 119. The Court notes that the environmental impact assessments which
e necessary to reach a decision on any plan that is liable to cause sig-


ficant transboundary harm to another State must be notified by the
 rty concerned to the other party, through CARU, pursuant to Arti-
  7, second and third paragraphs, of the 1975 Statute. This notification
 intended to enable the notified party to participate in the process of
 suring that the assessment is complete, so that it can then consider the
an and its effects with a full knowledge of the facts (Article 8 of the
 75 Statute).
 120. The Court observes that this notification must take place before
e State concerned decides on the environmental viability of the plan,
king due account of the environmental impact assessment submitted to

121. In the present case, the Court observes that the notification to
 gentina of the environmental impact assessments for the CMB (ENCE)
d Orion (Botnia) mills did not take place through CARU, and that
 uguay only transmitted those assessments to Argentina after having
ued the initial environmental authorizations for the two mills in
estion. Thus in the case of CMB (ENCE), the matter was notified to
 gentina on 27 October and 7 November 2003, whereas the initial
vironmental authorization had already been issued on 9 October 2003.
  the case of Orion (Botnia), the file was transmitted to Argentina
tween August 2005 and January 2006, whereas the initial environmental
thorization had been granted on 14 February 2005. Uruguay ought
t, prior to notification, to have issued the initial environmental auth-
 zations and the authorizations for construction on the basis of the envi-
nmental impact assessments submitted to DINAMA. Indeed by doing
   Uruguay gave priority to its own legislation over its procedural
ligations under the 1975 Statute and disregarded the well-established
stomary rule reflected in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the
 w of Treaties, according to which “[a] party may not invoke the pro-
 ions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a
 aty”.

122. The Court concludes from the above that Uruguay failed to
mply with its obligation to notify the plans to Argentina through
ARU under Article 7, second and third paragraphs, of the 1975
atute.

 C. Whether the Parties Agreed to Derogate from the Procedural
            Obligations Set Out in the 1975 Statute
123. Having thus examined the procedural obligations laid down by
e 1975 Statute, the Court now turns to the question of whether the
 rties agreed, by mutual consent, to derogate from them, as alleged by
 uguay.
124. In this respect the Parties refer to two “agreements” reached on
March 2004 and 5 May 2005 ; however, they hold divergent views
garding their scope and content.


 The “understanding” of 2 March 2004 between Argentina and
 Uruguay

125. The Court recalls that, after the issuing of the initial environmen-
 authorization to CMB by Uruguay, without CARU having been able
 carry out the functions assigned to it in this context by the 1975 Stat-
e, the Foreign Ministers of the Parties agreed on 2 March 2004 on the
ocedure to be followed, as described in the minutes of the extraordi-
ry meeting of CARU of 15 May 2004. The relevant extract from those
nutes reads as follows in Spanish :

    “II) En fecha 2 de marzo de 2004 los Cancilleres de Argentina y
  Uruguay llegaron a un entendimiento con relación al curso de
  acción que se dará al tema, esto es, facilitar por parte del gobierno
  uruguayo, la información relativa a la construcción de la planta y,
  en relación a la fase operativa, proceder a realizar el monitoreo, por
  parte de CARU, de la calidad de las aguas conforme a su Estatuto.
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
     I) Ambas delegaciones reafirmaron el compromiso de los Minis-
  tros de Relaciones Exteriores de la República Argentina y de la
  República Oriental del Uruguay de fecha 2 de marzo de 2004 por el
  cual el Uruguay comunicará la información relativa a la construc-
  ción de la planta incluyendo el Plan de Gestión Ambiental. En tal
  sentido, la CARU recibirá los Planes de Gestión Ambiental para la
  construcción y operación de la planta que presente la empresa al
  gobierno uruguayo una vez que le sean remitidos por la delegación
  uruguaya.” (Emphasis in the original.)
Argentina and Uruguay have provided the Court, respectively, with
ench and English translations of these minutes. In view of the discrep-
cies between those two translations, the Court will use the following
nslation :
     “(II) On 2 March 2004, the Foreign Ministers of Argentina and
  Uruguay reached an understanding on how to proceed in the matter,
  namely, that the Uruguayan Government would provide informa-
  tion on the construction of the mill and that, in terms of the opera-
  tional phase, CARU would carry out monitoring of water quality in
  accordance with its Statute.
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    (I) Both delegations reaffirmed the arrangement which had been
  come to by the Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Argentina and
  the Eastern Republic of Uruguay on 2 March 2004, whereby Uru-
  guay would communicate information on the construction of the
  mill, including the environmental management plan. As a result,
  CARU would receive the environmental management plans for the


   construction and operation of the mill provided by the company to
   the Uruguayan Government, when these were forwarded to it by the
   Uruguayan delegation.” (Emphasis in the original.) [Translation by
   the Court.]

 126. Uruguay considers that, under the terms of this “understanding”,
e Parties agreed on the approach to be followed in respect of the CMB
 NCE) project, outside CARU, and that there was no reason in law or
gic to prevent them derogating from the procedures outlined in the
 75 Statute pursuant to an appropriate bilateral agreement.
 The said “understanding”, according to Uruguay, only covered the
  nsmission to CARU of the Environmental Management Plans for the
 nstruction and operation of the (CMB) ENCE mill. It supposedly
ereby puts an end to any dispute with Argentina regarding the proce-
 re laid down in Article 7 of the 1975 Statute. Lastly, Uruguay main-
 ns that the “understanding” of 2 March 2004 on the (CMB) ENCE
oject was later extended to include the Orion (Botnia) project, since the
ROCEL water quality monitoring plan put in place by CARU’s Sub-
 mmittee on Water Quality to implement that “understanding” related
  the activity of “both plants”, the CMB (ENCE) and Orion (Botnia)
 lls, the plural having been used in the title and text of the Subcommit-
  ’s report.
 127. Argentina, for its part, maintains that the “understanding”
 tween the two Ministers of 2 March 2004 was intended to ensure com-
 ance with the procedure laid down by the 1975 Statute and thus to
 ntroduce the CMB (ENCE) project within CARU, ending the dispute
   CARU’s jurisdiction to deal with the project. Argentina claims that it
 terated to the organs within CARU that it had not given up its rights
 der Article 7, although it accepted that the dispute between itself and
  uguay in this respect could have been resolved if the procedure con-
mplated in the “understanding” of 2 March 2004 had been brought to
conclusion.
 According to Argentina, however, Uruguay never transmitted the
quired information to CARU as it undertook to do in the “understand-
g” of 2 March 2004. Argentina also denies that the “understanding” of
March 2004 was extended to the Orion (Botnia) mill ; the reference to
 th future plants in the PROCEL plan does not in any way signify, in
  view, the renunciation of the procedure laid down by the 1975 Statute.
 128. The Court first notes that while the existence of the “understand-
g” of 2 March 2004, as minuted by CARU, has not been contested by
e Parties, they differ as to its content and scope. Whatever its specific
 signation and in whatever instrument it may have been recorded (the
ARU minutes), this “understanding” is binding on the Parties, to the
tent that they have consented to it and must be observed by them in
 od faith. They are entitled to depart from the procedures laid down by
e 1975 Statute, in respect of a given project pursuant to an appropriate
 ateral agreement. The Court recalls that the Parties disagree on whether


e procedure for communicating information provided for by the “under-
 nding” would, if applied, replace that provided for by the 1975 Stat-
e. Be that as it may, such replacement was dependent on Uruguay
mplying with the procedure laid down in the “understanding”.


129. The Court finds that the information which Uruguay agreed to
 nsmit to CARU in the “understanding” of 2 March 2004 was never
 nsmitted. Consequently, the Court cannot accept Uruguay’s conten-
 n that the “understanding” put an end to its dispute with Argentina in
 pect of the CMB (ENCE) mill, concerning implementation of the pro-
dure laid down by Article 7 of the 1975 Statute.

130. Further, the Court observes that, when this “understanding” was
ached, only the CMB (ENCE) project was in question, and that it
erefore cannot be extended to the Orion (Botnia) project, as Uruguay
 ims. The reference to both mills is made only as from July 2004, in the
ntext of the PROCEL plan. However, this plan only concerns the
easures to monitor and control the environmental quality of the river
 ters in the areas of the pulp mills, and not the procedures under Article
of the 1975 Statute.
131. The Court concludes that the “understanding” of 2 March
04 would have had the effect of relieving Uruguay of its obligations
 der Article 7 of the 1975 Statute, if that was the purpose of the “under-
 nding”, only if Uruguay had complied with the terms of the “under-
 nding”. In the view of the Court, it did not do so. Therefore the
nderstanding” cannot be regarded as having had the effect of exempting
 uguay from compliance with the procedural obligations laid down by
e 1975 Statute.

 The agreement setting up the High-Level Technical Group (the
 GTAN)
132. The Court notes that, in furtherance of the agreement reached on
May 2005 between the Presidents of Argentina and Uruguay (see para-
aph 40 above), the Foreign Ministries of the two States issued a press
 ease on 31 May 2005 announcing the creation of the High-Level Tech-
cal Group, referred to by the Parties as the GTAN. According to this
mmuniqué :
     “In conformity with what was agreed to by the Presidents of
  Argentina and Uruguay, the Foreign Ministries of both of our
  countries constitute, under their supervision, a Group of Techni-
  cal Experts for complementary studies and analysis, exchange of
  information and follow-up on the effects that the operation of the
  cellulose plants that are being constructed in the Eastern Republic
  of Uruguay will have on the ecosystem of the shared Uruguay
  River.


     This Group . . . is to produce an initial report within a period of
   180 days.”

 133. Uruguay regards this press release as an agreement that binds the
 o States, whereby they decided to make the GTAN the body within
hich the direct negotiations between the Parties provided for by
 ticle 12 of the 1975 Statute would take place, since its purpose was to
 alyse the effects on the environment of the “operation of the cellu-
 e plants that are being constructed in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay”.
 uguay infers from this that the Parties were agreed on the construction
 the mills and that they had limited the extent of the dispute between
em to the environmental risks caused by their operation. Uruguay sees
oof of this in the referral to the Court on the basis of Article 12 of the
 75 Statute, which allows either Party to apply to the Court in the event
 the negotiations failing to produce an agreement within the period of
 0 days.
 According to Uruguay, therefore, the agreement contained in the press
 ease of 31 May 2005, by paving the way for the direct negotiations
ovided for in Article 12, covered any possible procedural irregularities
 relation to Articles 7 et seq. of the 1975 Statute. Uruguay points out
at it communicated all the necessary information to Argentina during
e 12 meetings held by the GTAN and that it transmitted the Orion
 otnia) port project to CARU, as agreed by the Parties at the first meet-
g of the GTAN.
 134. Uruguay further notes that the 1975 Statute is silent as to whether
e notifying State may or may not implement a project while negotia-
 ns are ongoing. It acknowledges that, under international law, the ini-
 ting State must refrain from doing so during the period of negotiation,
 t takes the view that this does not apply to all work and, in particular,
at preparatory work is permitted. Uruguay acknowledges that it car-
 d out such work, for example construction of the foundations for the
 ion (Botnia) mill, but in its view this did not involve faits accomplis
hich prevented the negotiations from reaching a conclusion. Uruguay
 o considers that it had no legal obligation to suspend any and all work
  the port.

135. Argentina considers that no acceptance on its part of the con-
 uction of the disputed mills can be inferred from the terms of the press
ease of 31 May 2005. It submits that in creating the GTAN, the Parties
d not decide to substitute it for CARU, but regarded it as a means of
gotiation that would co-exist with the latter.

Contrary to Uruguay, Argentina takes the view that this matter has
en submitted to the Court on the basis of Article 60 of the 1975 Statute
d not of Article 12, since Uruguay, by its conduct, has prevented the
ter from being used as a basis, having allegedly disregarded the entire
ocedure laid down in Chapter II of the Statute. Argentina therefore


es it as for the Court to pronounce on all the breaches of the 1975 Stat-
e, including and not limited to the authorization for the construction of
e disputed mills.
136. Argentina submits that Uruguay, by its conduct, frustrated the
ocedures laid down in Articles 7 to 9 of the 1975 Statute and that, dur-
g the period of negotiation within the GTAN, Uruguay continued the
nstruction work on the Orion (Botnia) mill and began building the
 rt terminal. During that same period, Argentina reiterated, within
ARU, the need for Uruguay to comply with its procedural obligations
 der Articles 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute and to suspend the works.

Lastly, Argentina rejects Uruguay’s claim that the work on the foun-
tions of the Orion (Botnia) mill, its chimney and the port was merely
eliminary in nature and cannot be regarded as the beginning of con-
uction work as such. For Argentina, such a distinction is groundless
d cannot be justified by the nature of the work carried out.

 137. The Court first points out that there is no reason to distinguish,
  Uruguay and Argentina have both done for the purpose of their
 pective cases, between referral on the basis of Article 12 and of Arti-
  60 of the 1975 Statute. While it is true that Article 12 provides for
course to the procedure indicated in Chapter XV, should the negotia-
 ns fail to produce an agreement within the 180-day period, its purpose
ds there. Article 60 then takes over, in particular its first paragraph,
hich enables either Party to submit to the Court any dispute concerning
e interpretation or application of the Statute which cannot be settled by
 ect negotiations. This wording also covers a dispute relating to the
 erpretation or application of Article 12, like any other provision of the
 75 Statute.

138. The Court notes that the press release of 31 May 2005 sets out an
reement between the two States to create a negotiating framework, the
TAN, in order to study, analyse and exchange information on the
 ects that the operation of the cellulose plants that were being con-
 ucted in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay could have on the ecosystem
 the shared Uruguay River, with “the group [having] to produce an ini-
 l report within a period of 180 days”.
139. The Court recognizes that the GTAN was created with the aim of
abling the negotiations provided for in Article 12 of the 1975 Statute,
 o for a 180-day period, to take place. Under Article 11, these negotia-
 ns between the parties with a view to reaching an agreement are to be
ld once the notified party has sent a communication to the other party,
rough the Commission, specifying


   “which aspects of the work or the programme of operations might
   significantly impair navigation, the régime of the river or the quality


   of its waters, the technical reasons on which this conclusion is based
   and the changes suggested to the plan or programme of opera-
   tions”.

The Court is aware that the negotiation provided for in Article 12 of
e 1975 Statute forms part of the overall procedure laid down in Articles
 o 12, which is structured in such a way that the parties, in association
th CARU, are able, at the end of the process, to fulfil their obligation
 prevent any significant transboundary harm which might be caused by
 tentially harmful activities planned by either one of them.

 140. The Court therefore considers that the agreement to set up the
TAN, while indeed creating a negotiating body capable of enabling
e Parties to pursue the same objective as that laid down in Article 12
 the 1975 Statute, cannot be interpreted as expressing the agreement of
e Parties to derogate from other procedural obligations laid down by
e Statute.
 141. Consequently, the Court finds that Argentina, in accepting the
eation of the GTAN, did not give up, as Uruguay claims, the other
ocedural rights belonging to it by virtue of the 1975 Statute, nor the
 ssibility of invoking Uruguay’s responsibility for any breach of those
 hts. Argentina did not, in the agreement to set up the GTAN, “effect
 clear and unequivocal waiver” of its rights under the 1975 Statute
 ertain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary
bjections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 247, para. 13). Nor did it
nsent to suspending the operation of the procedural provisions of the
 75 Statute. Indeed, under Article 57 of the Vienna Convention on the
 w of Treaties of 23 May 1969, concerning “[s]uspension of the opera-
 n of a treaty”, including, according to the International Law Commis-
 n’s commentary, suspension of “the operation of . . . some of its
ovisions” (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1966,
ol. II, p. 251), suspension is only possible “in conformity with the pro-
 ions of the treaty” or “by consent of all the parties”.
 142. The Court further observes that the agreement to set up the
TAN, in referring to “the cellulose plants that are being constructed in
e Eastern Republic of Uruguay”, is stating a simple fact and cannot be
 erpreted, as Uruguay claims, as an acceptance of their construction by
 gentina.
 143. The Court finds that Uruguay was not entitled, for the duration
 the period of consultation and negotiation provided for in Articles 7 to
  of the 1975 Statute, either to construct or to authorize the construc-
 n of the planned mills and the port terminal. It would be contrary to
e object and purpose of the 1975 Statute to embark on disputed activi-
 s before having applied the procedures laid down by the “joint machin-
y necessary for the optimum and rational utilization of the [r]iver”
 rticle 1). However, Article 9 provides that : “[i]f the notified party raises
  objections or does not respond within the period established in Arti-


   8 [180 days], the other party may carry out or authorize the work
anned”.
 144. Consequently, in the opinion of the Court, as long as the proce-
 ral mechanism for co-operation between the parties to prevent signifi-
nt damage to one of them is taking its course, the State initiating the
anned activity is obliged not to authorize such work and, a fortiori, not
  carry it out.
 145. The Court notes, moreover, that the 1975 Statute is perfectly in
 eping with the requirements of international law on the subject, since
e mechanism for co-operation between States is governed by the prin-
ple of good faith. Indeed, according to customary international law, as
flected in Article 26 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of
 eaties, “[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must
   performed by them in good faith”. That applies to all obligations
 ablished by a treaty, including procedural obligations which are essen-
 l to co-operation between States. The Court recalled in the cases con-
rning Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France) (New Zealand v. France):
     “One of the basic principles governing the creation and perform-
   ance of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of
   good faith. Trust and confidence are inherent in international
   co-operation . . .” (Judgments, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 268, para. 46,
   and p. 473, para. 49 ; see also Border and Transborder Armed Actions
   (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,
   I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 105, para. 94.)
 146. The Court has also had occasion to draw attention to the charac-
 istics of the obligation to negotiate and to the conduct which this
 poses on the States concerned : “[the Parties] are under an obligation
  to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful” (North
 a Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark ; Federal
 public of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47,
 ra. 85).
 147. In the view of the Court, there would be no point to the co-opera-
 n mechanism provided for by Articles 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute if the
 rty initiating the planned activity were to authorize or implement it
thout waiting for that mechanism to be brought to a conclusion.
deed, if that were the case, the negotiations between the parties would
  longer have any purpose.
 148. In this respect, contrary to what Uruguay claims, the preliminary
ork on the pulp mills on sites approved by Uruguay alone does not con-
tute an exception. This work does in fact form an integral part of the
nstruction of the planned mills (see paragraphs 39 and 42 above).

149. The Court concludes from the above that the agreement to set up
e GTAN did not permit Uruguay to derogate from its obligations of
 ormation and notification under Article 7 of the 1975 Statute, and that
  authorizing the construction of the mills and the port terminal at


 ay Bentos before the expiration of the period of negotiation, Uruguay
 led to comply with the obligation to negotiate laid down by Article 12
  the Statute. Consequently, Uruguay disregarded the whole of the
-operation mechanism provided for in Articles 7 to 12 of the 1975 Statute.
150. Given that “an obligation to negotiate does not imply an obliga-
 n to reach an agreement” (Railway Traffic between Lithuania and
 land, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116), it
mains for the Court to examine whether the State initiating the plan is
 der certain obligations following the end of the negotiation period pro-
ded for in Article 12.

            D. Uruguay’s Obligations Following the End
                    of the Negotiation Period
151. Article 12 refers the Parties, should they fail to reach an agree-
ent within 180 days, to the procedure indicated in Chapter XV.

Chapter XV contains a single article, Article 60, according to which :
      “Any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the
   Treaty and the Statute which cannot be settled by direct negotiations
   may be submitted by either party to the International Court of Jus-
   tice.
      In the cases referred to in Articles 58 and 59, either party may sub-
   mit any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the
   Treaty and the Statute to the International Court of Justice, when it
   has not been possible to settle the dispute within 180 days following
   the notification referred to in Article 59.”
152. According to Uruguay, the 1975 Statute does not give one party
“right of veto” over the projects initiated by the other. It does not con-
 er there to be a “no construction obligation” borne by the State initi-
 ng the projects until such time as the Court has ruled on the dispute.
 uguay points out that the existence of such an obligation would enable
 e party to block a project that was essential for the sustainable devel-
 ment of the other, something that would be incompatible with the
 ptimum and rational utilization of the [r]iver”. On the contrary, for
 uguay, in the absence of any specific provision in the 1975 Statute, ref-
ence should be made to general international law, as reflected in the
01 draft Articles of the International Law Commission on Prevention
  Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Yearbook of the
 ernational Law Commission, 2001, Vol. II, Part Two) ; in particular,
aft Article 9, paragraph 3, concerning “Consultations on preventive
easures”, states that “[i]f the consultations . . . fail to produce an agreed
 ution, the State of origin shall nevertheless take into account the inter-
 s of the State likely to be affected in case it decides to authorize the
tivity to be pursued . . .”.

her party may neither carry out nor authorize the work in question
 til the procedure laid down in Articles 7 to 12 has been completed and
e Court has ruled on the project. Argentina therefore considers that,
 ring the dispute settlement proceedings before the Court, the State
hich is envisaging carrying out the work cannot confront the other
 rty with the fait accompli of having carried it out.

 Argentina argues that the question of the “veto” raised by Uruguay is
appropriate, since neither of the parties can impose its position in
 pect of the construction works and it will ultimately be for the Court
  settle the dispute, if the parties disagree, by a decision that will have
e force of res judicata. It could be said, according to Argentina, that
 uguay has no choice but to come to an agreement with it or to await
e settlement of the dispute. Argentina contends that, by pursuing the
nstruction and commissioning of the Orion (Botnia) mill and port,
 uguay has committed a continuing violation of the procedural obliga-
 ns under Chapter II of the 1975 Statute.
 154. The Court observes that the “no construction obligation”, said to
  borne by Uruguay between the end of the negotiation period and the
cision of the Court, is not expressly laid down by the 1975 Statute and
 es not follow from its provisions. Article 9 only provides for such an
 ligation during the performance of the procedure laid down in Arti-
 s 7 to 12 of the Statute.
 Furthermore, in the event of disagreement between the parties on the
anned activity persisting at the end of the negotiation period, the Stat-
e does not provide for the Court, to which the matter would be sub-
 tted by the State concerned, according to Argentina, to decide whether
  not to authorize the activity in question. The Court points out that,
hile the 1975 Statute gives it jurisdiction to settle any dispute concern-
g its interpretation or application, it does not however confer on it the
 e of deciding in the last resort whether or not to authorize the planned
tivities. Consequently, the State initiating the plan may, at the end of
e negotiation period, proceed with construction at its own risk.
 The Court cannot uphold the interpretation of Article 9 according to
hich any construction is prohibited until the Court has given its ruling
 rsuant to Articles 12 and 60.
 155. Article 12 does not impose an obligation on the parties to submit
matter to the Court, but gives them the possibility of doing so, follow-
g the end of the negotiation period. Consequently, Article 12 can do
 thing to alter the rights and obligations of the party concerned as long
  the Court has not ruled finally on them. The Court considers that


ose rights include that of implementing the project, on the sole respon-
 ility of that party, since the period for negotiation has expired.
156. In its Order of 13 July 2006, the Court took the view that the
onstruction [of the mills] at the current site cannot be deemed to create
 ait accompli” (Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uru-
ay), Provisional Measures, Order of 13 July 2006, I.C.J. Reports 2006,
  133, para. 78). Thus, in pronouncing on the merits in the dispute
tween the Parties, the Court is the ultimate guarantor of their compli-
 ce with the 1975 Statute.
157. The Court concludes from the above that Uruguay did not bear
 y “no construction obligation” after the negotiation period provided
r in Article 12 expired on 3 February 2006, the Parties having deter-
 ned at that date that the negotiations undertaken within the GTAN
 d failed (see paragraph 40). Consequently the wrongful conduct of
 uguay (established in paragraph 149 above) could not extend beyond
at period.
158. Having established that Uruguay breached its procedural obliga-
 ns to inform, notify and negotiate to the extent and for the reasons
ven above, the Court will now turn to the question of the compliance of
at State with the substantive obligations laid down by the 1975 Statute.


                                 * *

                    IV. SUBSTANTIVE OBLIGATIONS

159. Before taking up the examination of the alleged violations of
bstantive obligations under the 1975 Statute, the Court will address
o preliminary issues, namely, the burden of proof and expert
dence.

              A. Burden of Proof and Expert Evidence
160. Argentina contends that the 1975 Statute adopts an approach in
 ms of precaution whereby “the burden of proof will be placed on Uru-
ay for it to establish that the Orion (Botnia) mill will not cause signifi-
nt damage to the environment”. It also argues that the burden of proof
ould not be placed on Argentina alone as the Applicant, because, in its
 w, the 1975 Statute imposes an equal onus to persuade — for the one
at the plant is innocuous and for the other that it is harmful.

 161. Uruguay, on the other hand, asserts that the burden of proof is
  Argentina, as the Applicant, in accordance with the Court’s long-
 nding case law, although it considers that, even if the Argentine posi-
 n about transferring the burden of proof to Uruguay were correct, it
ould make no difference given the manifest weakness of Argentina’s


 se and the extensive independent evidence put before the Court by
  uguay. Uruguay also strongly contests Argentina’s argument that the
 ecautionary approach of the 1975 Statute would imply a reversal of the
 rden of proof, in the absence of an explicit treaty provision prescribing
 as well as Argentina’s proposition that the Statute places the burden of
 oof equally on both Parties.


 162. To begin with, the Court considers that, in accordance with the
  ll-established principle of onus probandi incumbit actori, it is the duty
  the party which asserts certain facts to establish the existence of such
cts. This principle which has been consistently upheld by the Court
Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine), Judg-
  nt, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 86, para. 68 ; Sovereignty over Pedra
 anca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/
 ngapore), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 31, para. 45 ; Application
   the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
  nocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment,
C.J. Reports 2007 (I), p. 128, para. 204 ; Military and Paramilitary
  tivities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of
merica), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984,
  437, para. 101) applies to the assertions of fact both by the Applicant
 d the Respondent.
 163. It is of course to be expected that the Applicant should, in the
 st instance, submit the relevant evidence to substantiate its claims. This
  es not, however, mean that the Respondent should not co-operate in
 e provision of such evidence as may be in its possession that could assist
 e Court in resolving the dispute submitted to it.
 164. Regarding the arguments put forward by Argentina on the
versal of the burden of proof and on the existence, vis-à-vis each Party,
  an equal onus to prove under the 1975 Statute, the Court considers
 at while a precautionary approach may be relevant in the interpretation
 d application of the provisions of the Statute, it does not follow that it
  erates as a reversal of the burden of proof. The Court is also of the
  w that there is nothing in the 1975 Statute itself to indicate that it
aces the burden of proof equally on both Parties.


                                    *
 165. The Court now turns to the issue of expert evidence. Both
 gentina and Uruguay have placed before the Court a vast amount
 factual and scientific material in support of their respective claims.
hey have also submitted reports and studies prepared by the experts
 d consultants commissioned by each of them, as well as others
 mmissioned by the International Finance Corporation in its quality

e studies and reports submitted as part of the record and prepared, on
e one hand, by their respective experts and consultants, and on the
her, by the experts of the IFC, which contain, in many instances, con-
cting claims and conclusions. In reply to a question put by a judge,
 gentina stated that the weight to be given to such documents should be
termined by reference not only to the “independence” of the author,
ho must have no personal interest in the outcome of the dispute and
ust not be an employee of the government, but also by reference to the
aracteristics of the report itself, in particular the care with which its
 alysis was conducted, its completeness, the accuracy of the data used,
 d the clarity and coherence of the conclusions drawn from such data.
  its reply to the same question, Uruguay suggested that reports
epared by retained experts for the purposes of the proceedings
 d submitted as part of the record should not be regarded as
dependent and should be treated with caution ; while expert statements
 d evaluations issued by a competent international organization, such
  the IFC, or those issued by the consultants engaged by that
ganization should be regarded as independent and given “special weight”.


 167. The Court has given most careful attention to the material sub-
 tted to it by the Parties, as will be shown in its consideration of the
 dence below with respect to alleged violations of substantive obliga-
 ns. Regarding those experts who appeared before it as counsel at the
arings, the Court would have found it more useful had they been pre-
nted by the Parties as expert witnesses under Articles 57 and 64 of the
ules of Court, instead of being included as counsel in their respective
