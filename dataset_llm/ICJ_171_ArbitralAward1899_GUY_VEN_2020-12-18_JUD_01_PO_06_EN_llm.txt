                         Disagreement with the Court’s finding that the Court has jurisdiction —
                      The Court has not established that Venezuela has provided unequivocal consent to
                      the Court’s jurisdiction — The Secretary‑General’s choice of means of settlement
                      under Article IV (2) of the Geneva Agreement is not legally binding upon the
                      Parties — The Court’s textual analysis of Article IV (2) does not establish that
                      the Secretary-­General’s choice is binding — The object and purpose of the Geneva
                      Agreement is best understood as facilitating an agreed resolution of the dispute —
                      The Court ignores language in the Geneva Agreement which contradicts
                      its conclusion — The documents referred to by the Court do not support the
                      view that the Secretary‑General’s choice of the means of settlement is legally
                      binding — Other reasons given by the Court for finding the required consent are
                      unconvincing.


                         1. I have joined the Court’s unanimous finding that it lacks jurisdiction
                      to entertain the claims of the Co‑operative Republic of Guyana (herein­
                      after “Guyana”) which arise from events that occurred after the signature
                      of the Geneva Agreement. However, I disagree with the Court’s conclu-
                      sion that it has jurisdiction to entertain Guyana’s Application in so far as
                      it concerns the validity of the Arbitral Award of 3 October 1899 and “the
                      related question of the definitive settlement of the land boundary dispute”
                      between the Parties. In this opinion, I shall set forth the reasons for my
                      disagreement with the Court’s approach.

                         2. In my view, the Court’s Judgment in this case undermines the fun-
                      damental principle of consent of the parties to its jurisdiction and is
                      inconsistent with both the Court’s Statute and its jurisprudence. In its
                      prior judgments, the Court has established not only that the consent of
                      the parties is required for it to exercise jurisdiction, as is provided in its
                      Statute, but also that such consent must be “certain”, “unequivocal” and
                      “indisputable” 1. The Court in its Judgment ignores this high threshold
                      for finding consent, reaching the unprecedented decision to exercise juris-
                      diction on the basis of a treaty that does not even mention the Court, let
                      alone contain a compromissory clause. This is especially problematic
                      because one of the Parties has consistently refused to bring the present
                      dispute before the Court, as was most recently demonstrated by its deci-
                      sion not to participate in the proceedings, though it presented a Memo-
                      randum with serious legal arguments that, in my view, did not receive due

                         3. A key basis for the Court’s flawed approach to the issue of consent
                      is its finding that Article IV, paragraph 2 of the Geneva Agreement gives
                      the Secretary-­ General of the United Nations the authority to issue a
                      legally binding decision on the means of settlement to be employed by the
                      Parties. In my view, this interpretation is not supported by the text of the
                      Geneva Agreement or the Agreement’s object and purpose. The Geneva
                      Agreement was meant to assist the Parties in achieving an agreed resolu-
                      tion of their dispute, and not to subject the Parties to a particular form of
                      dispute settlement against their will.

                           I. The Allegedly Binding Nature of the Secretary-­General’s
                                               Choice of the Court

                        4. In paragraph 74 of the Judgment, the Court concludes that “the
                      Parties conferred on the Secretary‑General the authority to choose, by a
                      decision which is binding on them, the means to be used for the settle-
                      ment of their controversy” 2. This conclusion, in my view, is contrary to
                      the text of the Geneva Agreement, which contains no indication whatso-
                      ever that the Secretary‑General has the authority to make legally binding
                      decisions. In this respect, moreover, the Court misinterprets the Geneva
                      Agreement’s object and purpose, ignoring key elements of the preamble
                      and Article IV (2) which make absolutely clear that the true purpose of
                      the Agreement is to facilitate “an agreed settlement” 3 to the Parties’ dis-
                      pute. The factors relied upon by the Court in support of its interpretation
                      of the Geneva Agreement to me are not persuasive for the following rea-
                      sons.

                                              1. Text of the Geneva Agreement
                         5. In paragraph 72 of the Judgment, the Court analyses the provision
                      in Article IV (2) that the Parties “shall refer the decision as to the means
                      of settlement . . . to the Secretary-­General” and makes a finding that the
                      term “shall” “should be interpreted as imposing an obligation on States
                      parties”; that the term “refer” “conveys the idea of entrusting a matter to
                      a third party”; and that the term “decision” “is not synonymous with

                         9. The Court also purports to rely on the object and purpose of the
                      Geneva Agreement, which it characterizes in paragraph 73 of the
                      ­Judgment as “ensur[ing] a definitive resolution of the controversy between

                      the Parties” 8. This interpretation of the Agreement’s object and purpose,
                      in my view, is flawed, as it ignores several relevant portions of the Agree-
                      ment’s preamble and text.
                         10. First, the Court omits any discussion of the fourth paragraph of
                      the Geneva Agreement’s preamble, which provides that any outstanding
                      controversy between the parties should “be amicably resolved in a man-
                      ner acceptable to both parties”. This statement should not be taken to be
                      a mere platitude. The Court recently observed, in Ukraine v. Russia, that
                      “references to the ‘amicable solution’” of a dispute in Articles 12 and 13
                      of International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
                      Discrimination (CERD) indicate that “the objective of the CERD Com-
                      mittee procedure is for the States concerned to reach an agreed settlement
                      of their dispute” 9. There is even greater reason to find that the objective
                      of the Geneva Agreement is to reach an agreed settlement of the dispute,
                      by a solution “acceptable to both parties”.

                         11. Thus, I am of the view that the Geneva Agreement’s true object and
                      purpose is to assist the Parties in reaching an agreed resolution of the pres-
                      ent dispute. If the object and purpose of the Geneva Agreement is so
                      framed, the Secretary‑General’s role could be conceived of as similar to
                      that of a conciliator entrusted with helping the Parties reach an agreed
                      solution to the dispute rather than imposing a means of settlement on them.
                         12. A second significant flaw with the Court’s approach to the object
                      and purpose of the Geneva Agreement, in my view, is that it gives
                      ­inadequate consideration to the second sentence of Article IV (2). That
                       sentence provides:
                                    “If the means so chosen do not lead to a solution of the controversy,
                               the said organ or, as the case may be, the Secretary-­General of the
                               United Nations shall choose another of the means stipulated in
                               ­Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, and so on until
                                the controversy has been resolved or until all the means of peaceful
                                ­settlement there contemplated have been exhausted.” (Emphasis added.)

                         13. This provision requires the Secretary-­General to continue choosing
                      from the means of settlement listed in Article 33 until one of two possible
                      outcomes is reached: either (1) the controversy between the Parties is
                      resolved, or (2) all the means of peaceful settlement contemplated in Arti-
                      cle 33 have been exhausted. So, Article IV (2) contains no presumption
                      that the controversy between the Parties will definitively be resolved.

                         14. This provision in Article IV (2), in my view, strongly indicates that
                      the Parties, in concluding the Geneva Agreement, did not intend to sub-
                      ject themselves to a binding method of dispute resolution that would
                      guarantee a definitive resolution of the controversy. If this had been their
                      intent, they could have left out the final portion of Article IV (2), instead
                      ending that provision with the phrase “and so on until the controversy
                      has been resolved”. Article IV (2) is better interpreted as requiring agree-
                      ment by the Parties before the Secretary‑General’s choice of the means of
                      settlement may be implemented. Such an interpretation would explain
                      how the Secretary‑General’s choice of a binding means such as judicial
                      settlement could leave the controversy unresolved, namely by allowing
                      for the possibility that the Parties would fail to agree on the implementa-
                      tion of the Secretary-­General’s choice. Therefore, in my view, the final
                      sentence of Article IV (2) provides additional evidence that the Geneva
                      Agreement aims to facilitate an agreed resolution of the controversy, and
                      not a resolution that is imposed upon the Parties by any third party.

                      A. Documents relied upon by the Court
                         17. The Court cites a number of documents promulgated after the con-
                      clusion of the Geneva Agreement in order to prove that the Parties (and
                      Venezuela in particular) agreed with its interpretation of Article IV (2). In
                      my view, none of these documents contains any acknowledgment that the
                      Secretary-­
                                General’s choice of means was meant to be legally binding

                      upon the Parties. Rather than supporting the Court’s position, the docu-
                      ments cited in the Judgment only further indicate that there has been no
                      “unequivocal” and “indisputable” expression of consent to the Court’s
                      jurisdiction, as required by the Court’s jurisprudence.

                         25. Apart from the supposedly binding nature of the Secretary-­
                      General’s decision‑making authority, the Court rests on two other argu-
                      ments in attempting to demonstrate the Parties’ consent to the Court’s
                      jurisdiction. First, it states in paragraph 82 that, by including a renvoi to
                      Article 33 of the United Nations Charter (which in turn refers to judicial
                      settlement) in Article IV (2), the Parties “accepted the possibility of the
                      controversy being settled by that means” 17. It adds that if the Parties had
                      wished to exclude judicial settlement, they could have done so during
                      their negotiations 18. However, there is a significant difference between the
                      Parties “accept[ing] the possibility” of recourse to judicial settlement and
                      their unequivocal consent in advance to such settlement. Moreover, by
                      the Court’s own logic, if the Parties had wished to provide consent in
                      advance to judicial settlement by the Court, without the need for further
                      agreement between them, they could have included an express statement
                      to this effect in Article IV (2). However, they chose not to do so.

                         26. Secondly, the Court suggests in paragraph 114 that Article IV (2)’s
                      reference to the decision of the Secretary-­General would be deprived of
                      effet utile if that decision were subject to the further consent by the Par-
                      ties for its implementation. However, this argument does not account for
                      the possibility that the Secretary‑General could have a non‑binding role
                      in the dispute settlement process, akin to that of a conciliator. While it is
                      true that the Secretary-­General’s role only comes into play when the Par-
                      ties have otherwise failed to agree on a means of settlement, this does not
                      mean that his intervention in a non‑legally binding capacity would neces-
                      sarily be unhelpful. Article 33 of the United Nations Charter makes clear
                      that negotiation is a form of dispute settlement separate from conciliation
                      or mediation, indicating that there is distinct value to the latter proce-
                      dures even if the third party in question is not empowered to issue bind-
                      ing decisions.


                                                           III. Conclusion

                        27. Given the foregoing, I am of the view that the Geneva Agreement
                      contains no certain, unequivocal indication of the Parties’ consent to the
                      Court’s jurisdiction, and therefore the Court has erred in finding that it
                      has jurisdiction to entertain Guyana’s Application.

                       28. The dangers of the Court’s approach are well illustrated by its ulti-

                      523 	 arbitral award of 3 october 1899 (diss. op. gevorgian)

                      cerning the “definitive settlement of the land boundary dispute” between
                      Guyana and Venezuela 19. This would be a decision of potentially enor-
                      mous significance for the Parties, and thus the fact that the Court bases
                      its finding of jurisdiction to make this decision upon an instrument that
                      contains no compromissory clause and does not even mention the Court
                      is cause for concern.
                         29. Rather than basing itself upon an unequivocal, indisputable indica-
                      tion of Venezuela’s consent, as its jurisprudence requires, the Court goes
                      looking for reasons to exercise jurisdiction, relying in particular on the
                      presumed intentions of the Parties and upon a series of statements that
                      are, at best, of ambiguous meaning. The Court ignores language in the
                      text of the Geneva Agreement that squarely contradicts its position and is
                      unable to point to any express statement evidencing either consent to this
                      Court’s jurisdiction or an acknowledgment that the Secretary‑General’s
                      choice of the means of settlement is legally binding. In my view, this
                      approach is wrong and undermines the fundamental principle of consent
                      by the parties to the jurisdiction of the Court.
