1. The Court in its Judgment finds that the Observations of Serbia and
Montenegro have not had the legal effect of discontinuance of proceed-
ings under the Rules (para. 30). I agree. It is clear that the Applicant has
declined to “discontinue”, and that “discontinuance” as envisaged in the
Rules is dependent on the consent of the Parties.

2. The Court further observes that:

“Prior to the adoption of Article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of
Court, in a number of cases in which the application disclosed no
subsisting title of jurisdiction, but merely an invitation to the State
named as respondent to accept jurisdiction for the purposes of the
case, the Court removed the cases from the List by order. By Orders
of 2 June 1999, it removed from the List two cases brought by Serbia
and Montenegro concerning Legality of the Use of Force against
Spain and the United States of America, on the ground that the
Court ‘manifestly lack[ed] jurisdiction’ (I. C.J. Reports 1999, pp. 773
and 925).” (Judgment, para. 31.)

3. The Court then observes that “[t]he present case does not however
fall into either of these categories”. The Court thus appears to regard
these as a closed list of categories for the removal of cases from the List
(other than where discontinuance has occurred), and to suggest that no
removal from the List was open to the Court in the present case as the
facts do not fall within the existing two examples.

6. The Court has also declined to proceed with cases in circumstances
other than discontinuance under the Rules. The Permanent Court termi-
nated interim measures proceedings in the Prince von Pless Administra-
tion case, on the grounds that the request made by Germany in its Appli-
cation had ceased to have any object (Order of 11 May 1933, P.C.LJ.,
Series A/B, No. 54, p. 150). And in the Northern Cameroons case, the
Court declined to proceed further with a case for what it saw as reasons
of judicial propriety (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, LCJ.
Reports 1963, p. 29). In the Nuclear Tests cases, the Court did not
regard itself as constrained by the fact that Australia and New Zealand



had not, after the French announcement of the conclusion of its testing,
discontinued the proceedings under Article 74 of the 1972 Rules. The
Court stated that “this does not prevent the Court from making its own
independent finding” (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 270, para. 54; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v.
France), Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 476, para. 57) and it deter-
mined that “the object of the claim has been achieved by other means”
— i.e., means other than litigation (Nuclear Tests ( Australia v. France),
Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 271, para. 55; Nuclear Tests (New
Zealand v. France), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 476, para. 58).

7. In a pertinent dictum the Court stated that it saw:

“no reason to allow the continuance of proceedings which it knows
are bound to be fruitless. While judicial settlement may provide a
path to international harmony in circumstances of conflict, it is none
the less true that the needless continuance of litigation is an obstacle
to such harmony.” (Nuclear Tests ( Australia v. France), Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 271, para. 58; Nuclear Tests (New Zea-
land v. France), Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 61.)

8. In its Orders of 2 June 1999 (Legality of Use of Force ( Yugosla-
via v. United States of America), Provisional Measures, Order of
2 June 1999, LC.J. Reports 1999, p. 916; Legality of Use of Force
( Yugoslavia v. Spain), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999,
L C.J. Reports 1999, p. 761) the Court had removed the cases from the
List after hearings on provisional measures, on the grounds that the
Court manifestly lacked jurisdiction. And, as was recognized in the Judg-
ment at paragraph 31, prior to the formulation of Article 38, para-
graph 5, of the Rules of Court, there were cases removed from the List
because the application was merely an invitation to the respondent.

9. These were actions by the Court in the exercise of its inherent
powers. The precedents on removal from the List cited by the Court
— where from the outset no subsisting title of jurisdiction has been
disclosed, or where the Court manifestly lacked jurisdiction — do not
constitute two exclusive categories within which the Court has to fall if it
wishes to exercise its inherent powers in the absence of discontinuance.
There is nothing in the case law that so suggests. Indeed, it is hard to
know what might be the legal source of a right to remove cases from the
List provided only that this would be limited to these two examples.

10. The Court’s inherent jurisdiction derives from its judicial character
and the need for powers to regulate matters connected with the adminis-



tration of justice, not every aspect of which may have been foreseen in
the Rules. It was on such a basis that the Permanent Court had admitted
the filing of preliminary objections to jurisdiction even before this possi-
bility was regulated by the Rules of Court. The Court stated that it was
“at liberty to adopt the principle which it considers best calculated to
ensure the administration of justice” (Mavrommatis Palestine Conces-
sions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 2, p. 16). The power
of the Court to identify remedies for any breach of a treaty, in a case
where jurisdiction was based solely upon the treaty concerned, has been
regarded as within the Court’s inherent powers in the Corfu Channel case
(Assessment of Amount of Compensation, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1949,
p. 244) and in the LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America) case
(Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany, Vol. I, 16 Septem-
ber 1999, para. 3.60).

11. The very occasional need to exercise inherent powers may arise as
a matter in limine litis, or as a decision by the Court not to exercise a
jurisdiction it has, or in connection with the conduct or the merits of a
case. The judges who jointly dissented in the Nuclear Tests cases did not
challenge the existence of such inherent powers. They asserted that their
use “must be considered as highly exceptional and a step to be taken only
when the most cogent considerations of judicial propriety so require”
(Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1974,
p. 322, para. 22, joint dissenting opinion). Understandably, these judges
were particularly concerned that the exercise of the power to decide pro-
prio motu should not be exercised without affording an applicant the
opportunity to submit counter arguments, as this was not consonant with
the due administration of justice. In the present instance, the issue of
whether the case should be removed from the List was fully canvassed
before the Court.

12. Thus the real question is not whether the Applicant has or has not
“discontinued” the case, nor whether the present circumstances are exactly
identical to the few examples where the Court itself has removed a case
from the List (examples which will, in their turn, have been “new” at the
relevant time and not falling into any previously established category).
The question is whether the circumstances are such that it is reasonable,
necessary and appropriate for the Court to strike the case off the List
as an exercise of inherent power to protect the integrity of the judicial
process.

13. The starting point for discontinuance is Article 38, paragraph 2, of
the Rules of Court, whereby the applicant “shall specify as far as possible
the legal grounds upon which the jurisdiction of the Court is said to be
based”. The Court may, in certain circumstances, allow these grounds of
jurisdiction to be enlarged, and it may also occur that an applicant later
prefers to proceed on the basis of one specified ground rather than
another. Nonetheless, for all the flexibility built in to Article 38, para-



graph 2, of the Rules, the obligation contained in it is a continuing one.
An applicant which on Monday specifies two bases of jurisdiction for the
case it wishes the Court to decide, and on Thursday informs the Court
that these are not, after all, grounds on which it relies, cannot be said on
Saturday to be in conformity with Article 38, paragraph 2. It has put
itself out of conformity with Article 38, paragraph 2, and the fact that it
at the same time declines to “discontinue” the case under Article 88 or 89
of the Rules is irrelevant to that fact.

14. No more is the position of the Applicant who resiled from speci-
fied heads of jurisdiction without proffering others rendered in compli-
ance with the Rules by virtue of asking the Court “to decide on its
jurisdiction” in the light of these changes of position (Judgment, para. 27).
Such a request is totally outside of the contemplation of the Rules. Yet
this is what has occurred in this case. On 24 April 1999 the then Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia filed its Application instituting proceedings
against various States, invoking as the basis of the Court’s jurisdiction
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, as well as Article IX
of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide. On 20 December 2002, Serbia and Montenegro formally stipu-
lated that it was not a party to the Statute of the Court before 1 Novem-
ber 2000 — and that at the time of its initial Application, it was not
bound by the Genocide Convention.

15. Having thus put itself in a position incompatible with Article 38,
paragraph 2, of the Rules, Serbia and Montenegro did not inform the
Court it was discontinuing the case under Article 89 of the Rules, but
rather “asked the Court to decide on its jurisdiction”. It was in fact in no
position to make such a request of the Court, and these events alone are
sufficient, in my view, for the Court to have used its inherent powers to
ensure orderly conduct of its judicial function, and to have removed the
cases from the List.

16. In the event, the disorderly nature of the course now being fol-
lowed by Serbia and Montenegro was compounded. In response to its
initial claims on the merits against the various respondent States, in the
eight cases allowed to proceed by the Court beyond the initial hearings
on provisional measures, preliminary objections were lodged. For the
ensuing three years no response was made to these objections — and
indeed, when extremely brief Written Observations were eventually made,
they did not even attempt to counter or otherwise respond to the sub-
stantive arguments contained in the preliminary objections of the Respon-
dents. Instead, the Applicant resiled from its previously stated grounds of
jurisdiction and simply suggested that “the Court decide”. This incoher-
ent manner of proceeding is not, in my view, compatible with sound judi-
cial procedures, which are designed to be fair to all parties concerned,
and it provided further grounds for which the appropriate response of
the Court would have been to remove the cases from the List.

17. The regrettable history of events in this case falls within the
circumstances described by the Court in the Northern Cameroons
( Cameroon v. United Kingdom) case:

“There are inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial func-
tion which the Court, as a court of justice, can never ignore. There
may thus be an incompatibility between the desires of an applicant,
or, indeed, of both parties to a case, on the one hand, and on the
other hand the duty of the Court to maintain its judicial character.
The Court itself, and not the parties, must be the guardian of the
Court’s judicial integrity.” (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1963, p. 29.)

18. In paragraph 38 of the Judgment, the Court states that it “cannot
decline to entertain a case simply because of a suggestion as to the
motives of one of the parties or because its judgment may have implica-
tions in another case”. Some observations in response to this statement
have been made in paragraph 12 of the joint declaration of seven judges.
In that context it is also necessary to make some observations on the
remarkable attention given by the Court to Article 35, paragraph 2, of
the Statute. This provision had, of course, never been invoked by the
Applicant during the period when it relied on its original grounds of
jurisdiction. The Applicant’s irregular request of 20 December 2002 to
the Court was “to decide on its jurisdiction considering the pleadings
formulated in these Written Observations”. These Written Observations
contained no invocation of Article 35, paragraph 2, as an alternative
ground of jurisdiction — yet, going beyond what the Applicant requested
in the present case, the Court has devoted some 23 paragraphs to laying
the grounds for a finding that Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute
could not have been an alternative basis for allowing access to the Court
in respect of the Genocide Convention so far as Serbia and Montenegro
is concerned. This exercise was clearly unnecessary for the present case.
Its relevance can lie, and only lie, in another pending case. I believe the
Court should not have entered at all upon this ground in the present case.

19. Because I am of the firm view that grounds ratione personae
should not have been chosen for the disposition of this case (for reasons
elaborated in the joint declaration of seven judges), it is not my intention
here to offer my own views as to the arguments that the Court advances
to support its findings on this ground. It suffices to say that, while
General Assembly resolution 55/12 of 1 November 2000, admitting the



Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a new State, necessarily clarifies the
legal situation thereafter, it remains debatable whether “from the van-
tage point from which the Court now looks at the legal situation”, the
“new development in 2000 . . . has clarified the thus far amorphous legal
situation concerning the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
vis-à-vis the United Nations” at the relevant time (Judgment, para. 77).

20. It was said by Judge Lachs in 1992 that, while the various major
organs of the United Nations do each have their various roles to play in
a situation or dispute, they should act

“in harmony — though not, of course, in concert — and that each
should perform its functions with respect to a situation or dispute,
different aspects of which appear on the agenda of each, without
prejudicing the exercise of the other’s powers” (Questions of Inter-
pretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising
from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v.
United Kingdom), Provisional Measures, Order of 14 April 1992,
LC.J. Reports 1992, p. 27, separate opinion of Judge Lachs).

The Court, in purporting to find an ex post facto clarification of the
situation as it was in 1992-2000, notwithstanding that the General Assem-
bly and Security Council had in all deliberation felt the objectives of the
United Nations were best met by legal ambiguity, seems to have ignored
that wise dictum.
