   I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that there is no dispute in this case —
Role of the Court as envisaged by the United Nations Charter — Linear
development of the Court’s case law stressing objectivity, flexibility and substance
over form in the determination of dispute — The Court’s enquiry is empirical and
pragmatic, focused simply on whether or not the evidence reveals clearly opposite
views — Court’s case law does not support criterion applied by the majority that
the Respondent was aware or could not have been unaware that its views were
“positively opposed” by the Applicant — Awareness may be confirmatory, but is
not a prerequisite for determining the existence of a dispute — The Court has
previously relied upon post-Application evidence as determinative of the existence
of a dispute — Even if the test set out by the majority is applied to the facts of the
case, there is a dispute between the Parties.

  1. In this opinion, I explain why I have dissented from the majority
decision that there was no dispute between the Marshall Islands and
India.

   2. In the period of twenty months that I have served on this Court, I
have been privileged to consider the impact of many international law
obligations in cases before the Court. But I dare say that, were I to con-
sider the impact of another thousand obligations in the rest of my term,
none would be, by virtue of the existential threat to mankind posed by
nuclear weapons, as critically important for the work of the Court and
the interests of the international community as the question of the obliga-
tion to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations lead-
ing to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and eﬀective
international control.

  3. The United Nations Charter has assigned the Court a special role,
giving it a particular relevance in the maintenance of international peace
and security through the exercise of its judicial functions. It is regrettable
that the majority did not seize the opportunity presented by this case
to demonstrate the Court’s sensitivity to that role. It is even more regret-

table that this failure could have been avoided had the Court simply fol-
lowed its own case law. The Court’s case law has been consistent in the
approach to be adopted in determining the existence of a dispute ; an
approach that is not reﬂected in the Judgment.

   4. The jurisprudence of the Court calls for an objective, ﬂexible and
pragmatic approach in determining the existence of a dispute. It is ﬁrmly
established in the Court’s jurisprudence that a dispute arises where, exam-
ined objectively, there are “clearly opposite views concerning the question
of the performance or non-performance” 1 of a State’s obligations. There
is not a single case in the Court’s case law that authorizes the majority’s
proposition that the determination of the existence of a dispute requires a
ﬁnding of the respondent’s awareness of the applicant’s positive opposi-
tion to its views ; that is, that the absence of evidence of the respondent’s
awareness of the other party’s opposing view is fatal to a ﬁnding that a
dispute exists.

   6. The Court and its predecessor, the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice (PCIJ), have developed a signiﬁcant body of jurisprudence
interpreting the requirement that the Court can only decide a “dispute”
or “legal dispute”, as discussed in the next section of this opinion. How-
ever, it is important to note, that while many respondents have raised the
objection that the Court does not have jurisdiction because there is no
dispute, the Court has more often than not rejected this objection 3. This
is in keeping with a ﬂexible approach to ﬁnding a dispute — the criteria

tions, the Court determined that “Nicaragua makes two distinct claims — one that
Colombia has violated Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and maritime zones, and the other
that Colombia has breached its obligation not to use or threaten to use force”. The Court
found that there was a dispute in respect of the ﬁrst claim and no dispute in respect of
the second. Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean

  Before examining the Court’s case law, I look brieﬂy at the Court’s role
under the United Nations Charter.


                II. The Role of the Court as Envisaged by
                        the United Nations Charter

   7. An objective, ﬂexible and pragmatic approach to ﬁnding a dispute is
called for by the role envisaged for the Court by the United Nations Char-
ter. As I explained in my separate opinion in the case concerning Certain
Activities/Construction of a Road issued in December 2015 :

          “The United Nations Charter also highlights the important role the
       Court has in the peaceful settlement of disputes, ‘the continuance of
       which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace
       and security’ and thus undermine the purposes of the United Nations
       Charter 4. Article 92 of the United Nations Charter identiﬁes the
       Court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and pro-
       vides that its Statute — annexed to the United Nations Charter — is
       an integral part of the United Nations Charter. Article 36 (3) of the
       United Nations Charter provides that the Security Council ‘should
       also take into consideration that legal disputes, as a general rule, be
       referred by the parties to the International Court of Justice’. It is thus
       clear that the Court is expected, through its judicial function, to con-
       tribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. There-
       fore, the discharge by the Court of its judicial functions is not
       peripheral to, but is an integral part of the post-World War II system
       for the maintenance of international peace and security.” 5

   8. The Court has a diﬀerent relationship with the United Nations Char-
ter from that between the PCIJ and the Covenant of the League of
