12. In order to set the contentions of Tunisia in context, it is necessary to
recapitulate part of the reasoning in the 1982 Judgment. The Court was
seised by notification of a Special Agreement, under which it was requested



to determine the principles and rules of international law applicable for the
delimitation of the areas of the continental shelf appertaining to the Parties
and (in the Libyan translation from the original Arabic) to “clarify the
practical method for the application” of those principles and rules, or (in the
Tunisian translation) “to specify precisely the practical way” in which they
apply, so as to enable the experts of the two countries to delimit these areas
without any difficulties. At the stage of its reasoning dealing with methods of
delimitation, the Court identified a particular circumstance, related to the
conduct of the Parties, to which the methods proposed by the Parties gave, in
the view of the Court, “insufficient weight” (I. C.J. Reports 1982, p. 80, para.
113, p. 83, para. 117). The Court explained the circumstance in question as
follows :

“the history of the enactment of petroleum licensing legislation by each
Party, and the grant of successive petroleum concessions, during the
period from 1955 up to the signing of the Special Agreement, shows that
. . . the phenomenon of actual overlapping of claims did not appear until
1974, and then only in respect of areas some 50 miles from the coast. A
Tunisian enlarged concession of 21 October 1966 was bounded on the
east by a ‘stepped’ line (a form apparently dictated by the grid/block
system for grant of concessions) the eastern angles of which lay on a
straight line at a bearing of approximately 26° to the meridian. In 1968
Libya granted a concession (No. 137) ‘lying to the eastward of a line
running south/southwest from the point 33° 55’ N, 12° E to a point
about one nautical mile offshore’ the angle thereof viewed from Ras
Ajdir being 26° ; the western boundaries of subsequent Libyan conces-
sions followed the same line, which, Libya has explained, ‘followed the
direction of the Tunisian concessions’. The result was the appearance on
the map of a de facto line dividing concession areas which were the
subject of active claims, in the sense that exploration activities were
authorized by one Party, without interference, or (until 1976) protests,
by the other.” (Ibid., pp. 83-84, para. 117.)

13. In the operative part of its Judgment, the Court indicated inter alia that
“the delimitation is to be effected in accordance with equitable principles,
and taking account of all relevant circumstances” (para. 133 A (1)), and that
the relevant circumstances referred to included (inter alia) :

“the land frontier between the Parties, and their conduct prior to 1974 in
the grant of petroleum concessions, resulting in the employment of aline
seawards from Ras Ajdir at an angle of approximately 26° east of the
meridian, which line corresponds to the line perpendicular to the coast
at the frontier point which had in the past been observed as a de facto
maritime limit” (ibid., p. 93, para. 133 B (4)).

The practical method which the Court indicated for the application of the



relevant principles and rules of international law in the particular situation of
the case was, so far as here material, as follows :

“in the first sector, namely in the sector closer to the coast of the Parties,
the starting point for the line of delimitation is the point where the outer
limit of the territorial sea of the Parties is intersected by a straight line
drawn from the land frontier point of Ras Ajdir through the point
33° 55’ N, 12° E, which line runs at a bearing of approximately 26° east
of north, corresponding to the angle followed by the north-western
boundary of Libyan petroleum concessions numbers NC 76, 137,
NC 41 and NC 53, which was aligned on the south-eastern boundary of
Tunisian petroleum concession ‘Permis complémentaire offshore du
Golfe de Gabès’ (21 October 1966) ; from the intersection point so
determined, the line of delimitation between the two continental shelves
is to run north-east through the point 33° 55” N, 12° E, thus on that
same bearing, to the point of intersection with the parallel passing
through the most westerly point of the Tunisian coastline between Ras
Kaboudia and Ras Ajdir, that is to say, the most westerly point on the
shoreline (low-water mark) of the Gulf of Gabes” (I.C.J. Reports 1982,
pp. 93-94, para. 133 C (2)).

14. For this purpose the Court relied on the information as to the
boundaries of the concessions mentioned, particularly Concession No.
137, supplied by the Government of Libya, which had granted them. In its
Memorial, Libya stated that the area covered by that Concession lay “to the
eastward of a line running south/southwest from the point 33° 55’ N, 12° E
to a point about one nautical mile offshore”, adding that “The point of origin
viewed from Ras Ajdir is at an angle of 26 degrees”. In its Counter-Memorial,
Libya mentioned the “stepped eastern boundary” of the Tunisian concession
described in the 1982 Judgment as the “Permis complémentaire offshore du
Golfe de Gabes” (hereafter referred to as “the Tunisian permit”) and stated :
“This is the Concession boundary that runs in a direction northward at an
angle of 26° from Ras Ajdir.” Further on in the same pleading, Libya
indicated that

“on 30 April 1968, the Libyan authorities granted Concession No. 137 to
Aquitaine and Exwarb ... The western boundary of that Concession
followed the direction of the Tunisian Concessions granted in 1967 to
SNPA/RAP [ie., the Tunisian permit].”

Referring to later concessions further from the coast, Libya mentioned that
“The western boundary of both these Concessions followed the 26° line”, and
it concluded that “Libya has exercised considerable self-restraint in never
going west of the original 26° concession line in the grant of further con-
cessions”. At the hearings in 1981 the Agent of Libya referred to the Tunisian
permit as having “moved eastward from the due north line from Ras Ajdir. . .
to a line of 26° from Ras Ajdir”, and went on to say that “Libya’s first
concession in 1968 .. . avoided the possibility of conflict by adopting the
same line”.



15. The Government of Tunisia, relying on the report of an expert con-
sulted by it, annexed to the Application for revision, has drawn attention to
the following aspects of the factual situation. While the point 33° 55’ N,
12° E, referred to in the 1982 Judgment, corresponds to the north-western
corner of Libyan Concession No. 137, and its bearing from the frontier point
at Ras Ajdir has a value that is very close to 26°, the western boundary of
Concession No. 137 does not run at 26° to the meridian, since the “point
about one nautical mile offshore” referred to by Libya as its south-western
corner is not at a bearing of 26° from the frontier point at Ras Ajdir, but
approximately 1 mile to the east of Ras Ajdir, at 33° 10’ N, 11° 35’ E. The
bearing of this boundary is thus not 26° but 24° 57° 03”. Secondly, the
south-eastern corner points of the stepped line forming the eastern boundary
of the Tunisian permit are not in line, so that no straight line can be drawn
through them all ; a straight line which would leave all these points on the
west (i.e., would not encroach on the area of the Tunisian permit) would have
a bearing of 27° 50’ 01”. Thirdly, the north-western boundary of the Libyan
petroleum concessions, in particular Concession No. 137, “is not aligned with
the south-eastern boundary of the Tunisian permis complémentaire, however
one defines the latter’s alignment”. Quoting paragraph 121 of the Judgment,
which states that the Libyan boundary “was aligned with the eastern points
of the zig-zag south-eastern boundary” of the Tunisian concession, the expert
consulted by Tunisia notes that the alignment of these points

“neither merges with nor is parallel to the Libyan boundary (there is a
difference of 2° to 212°), nor parallel to line FP [that defined by the
decision of the Court between Ras Ajdir and point 33° 55° N 12° Ej
(difference of between 1° and 112°)”.

16. On this basis, Tunisia argues in its Application for revision that

“the delimitation line passing through point 33° 55’ N, 12° E would
allocate to Libya areas of continental shelf lying within the Tunisian
permit of 1966, contrary to what has been clearly decided by the Court,
whose entire decision is based on the idea of alignment between the
permits and concessions granted by the two Parties and on the resultant
absence of any overlapping of claims up to 1974 and in the nearest
offshore areas, up to 50 miles from the coast (Judgment, para. 117). It
has been shown how this was the ‘one circumstance in particular’ which
the Court found ‘to be highly relevant to the determination of the

[RT

method of delimitation’.

It contends that the Resolution of the Libyan Council of Ministers of
28 March 1968, which, according to Tunisia, determined the real course of
the boundary of Concession No. 137, was a fact which

“was of such a nature as to be a decisive factor in the Court’s Judg-



ment, given that the Court relied upon certain statements by Libya
which prove to be contradicted by the document in question and that the
actual operative provisions of the Judgment define the delimitation line
to be drawn in accordance with criteria derived from those state-
ments”.

17. The geographic facts as to positions and bearings of the boundaries of
the relevant concessions as stated by the expert consulted by Tunisia are not
disputed by Libya. It has however been emphasized in the Libyan written
observations that “there can be no question of Libya presenting a misleading
picture of the course of its concessions” in its pleadings and argument in the
proceedings leading up to the 1982 Judgment. Libya points out that the
statements in its Memorial (quoted in paragraph 14 above) were perfectly
accurate : the south-western corner of Concession No. 137

“does lie approximately one mile from the terminus of the land frontier
at Ras Ajdir, and the bearing of the angle viewed from Ras Ajdir to the
point of origin of the Concession (33° 55’ N, 12° E) is approximately
26°”.

Libya also observes that

“this Concession was portrayed by both Parties in their written and oral
pleadings on small-scale maps. Neither Party showed any interest in the
details as to the precise course of the boundary of Concession No. 137
or, indeed, of Tunisia’s 1966 Concession, and neither Party furnished
large-scale, detailed maps in this regard. Libya’s descriptions of its
concessions, therefore, were not intended to be detailed, but to give the
general setting which was accurate given the scale of the maps presented.
Nor were there any statements made by Libya as to a precise relation-
ship of Libyan Concession No. 137 to Tunisia’s 1966 Concession. That
there was a generally common boundary between these Concessions,
following a direction of approximately 26° as viewed from Ras Ajdir,
was the extent of the descriptive detail given to the Court by Libya and
portrayed on its small-scale maps and, as such, was correct.”

18. Libya does however dispute the admissibility of the Tunisian Appli-
cation for revision, on both factual and legal grounds. It contends that the
Application of Tunisia fails to comply with any of the conditions set by
Article 61 of the Statute (set out in paragraph 11 above), with the exception of
the condition as to the ten-year limit laid down in paragraph 5. It con-
tends :

— that the fact relied on was known to Tunisia, either at the time of the 1982
Judgment or at some time earlier than six months before the filing of the
Application for revision ;

— that if the fact was unknown to Tunisia, that ignorance was due to negli-
gence on the part of Tunisia ; and



— that Tunisia has failed to show that the fact discovered was “of such a
nature as to be a decisive factor”.

19. Article 61 of the Statute provides that an application for revision of a
judgment may be made only when it is based upon the discovery of a fact
“which was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also to
the party claiming revision”. So far as knowledge of the fact in question could
be derived fiom the pleadings and material submitted to the Court in the
proceedings leading up to the original judgment, anything which was known
to the Court must equally have been known to the party claiming revision.
The Court must be taken to be aware of every fact established by the material
before it, whether or not it expressly refers to such fact in its judgment ;
similarly, a party cannot argue that it was unaware of a fact which was set
forth in the pleadings of its opponent, or in a document annexed to those
pleadings or otherwise regularly brought before the Court.

20. In its Application, Tunisia contends that

“The new fact, that is to say, the fact unknown both to the Court and
to Tunisia before the delivery of the Judgment consists in the discovery
of the text of the Resolution of the Libyan Council of Ministers dated 28
March 1968, which determines the true course of the north-western
boundary of Libyan concession No. 137, a course which, as has been
demonstrated, is very different from the one emerging from the descrip-
tions Libya gave during the written and oral proceedings. This docu-
ment was not drawn to the attention of the Court. It is neither in the
Memorial and ‘Annexes of Libya nor in the documents provided by
Libya in the course of the proceedings.”

Annexed to the Tunisian Application was what was described as the “De-
scription of Concession No. 137 as defined in the Resolution of the Council
of Ministers of 28 March 1968”. Libya contends however that the actual
Resolution in question contained no details as to Concession No.
137, nor did it include a map. The document annexed to the Tunisian
Application is, according to Libya, a reproduction of an Annex to the
pertinent Concession Agreement, setting forth the area covered by the
Concession in square kilometres as well as the co-ordinates of the bound-
aries of the Concession. Libya has suggested that “technically this mistake
might be enough to render the Application inadmissible as an application
for revision”. The Court however considers that this would be an over-
formalistic approach. It will examine the matter on the basis that the fact
which allegedly was unknown in 1982 was the co-ordinates defining the
boundary of Concession No. 137, however those co-ordinates may have
been officially recorded. It is really on this basis that the matter has been
argued.

21. Itis however worth emphasizing at this point that the “new fact”, i.e.,
the fact the discovery of which is relied on to support the application for
revision, is solely the boundary co-ordinates. This entails, it is argued,



first that the boundary of the Libyan concession is not “aligned” on the
Tunisian permit, and secondly that the true north-western boundary of
Concession No. 137 “reveals a phenomenon of overlapping”, in that the line
passing through point 33° 55’ N, 12° E “would allocate to Libya areas of
continental shelf lying within the Tunisian permit of 1966, contrary to what
has been clearly decided by the Court”. It appears to the Court however that
while the actual co-ordinates may constitute a new fact, this is not the case as
regards the existence of an overlap between the north-western edge of Libyan
Concession No. 137 and the south-eastern edge of the Tunisian permit. The
expert consulted by Tunisia has himself shown in his report that the position
of the south-eastern tips of the zig-zag boundary of the Tunisian permit is
such that that boundary overlaps not only the line of the actual north-western
boundary of Concession No. 137, the bearing of which the expert calculates
as 24° 57’ 03”, but also the 26° line indicated by the Court as “a de facto line
dividing concession areas which were the subject of active claims” (I.C.J.
Reports 1982, p. 84, para. 117). Thus even assuming that Tunisia was given the
impression by Libya’s pleadings that the north-western boundary of Conces-
sion No. 137 ran at 26° to the meridian, ending at the point 33° 55’ N, 12° E,
and starting from a point one mile offshore of, and at a bearing of 26° from,
Ras Ajdir, it would necessarily have been aware of the existence of an overlap
with its own permit. The overlap with the 26° line was in fact almost twice as
great in area as that with the actual boundary of Concession No. 137, since
the southern end of that boundary was further east than the 26° line.

22. So far as the 26° line is concerned, Libya has in the present proceedings
drawn attention to a map attached to its Counter-Memorial of 1981, which
indicated some degree of overlap between the 26° line and the stepped
boundary of the Tunisian permit. Libya has also suggested that the overlap
was discernible, though with difficulty, on a map produced by Tunisia during
the oral proceedings in 1981. On the other hand, a map annexed to the Libyan
Memorial of 1980 shows all the outer (south-eastern) corner points of the
Tunisian stepped boundary as apparently lying on the 26° line, but this,
according to the expert consulted by Tunisia, was not correct since those
points did not lie on that line or indeed on any straight line. As for the actual
boundary of Concession No. 137, Libya has drawn attention in the present
proceedings to the fact that the map annexed to the Concession was repro-
duced as an Annex to the Libyan Counter-Memorial. That map, which bears
the legend “Approximated boundaries indicated in red” does not however
give the co-ordinates of the various boundary points. The boundaries are
shown superimposed upon a grid of degrees (not minutes) of latitude and
longitude, and the coastline is not shown, so that careful scaling would be
necessary to establish even the approximate position of the point nearest Ras
Ajdir.

23. That said, it should be noted that while Libya emphasizes that the



information it supplied to the Court in the proceedings leading up to the 1982
Judgment was accurate as far as it went, it does not in fact deny that the exact
co-ordinates of Concession No. 137 were not supplied to the Court by either
Party, so that Tunisia would not have been able to ascertain the exact location
of the Libyan concession from the pleadings and other material then before
the Court. The Court must however consider whether the circumstances were
such that means were available to Tunisia to ascertain the details of the
co-ordinates of the concession from other sources ; and indeed whether it was
in Tunisia’s own interests to do so. If such be the case, it does not appear to
the Court that it is open to Tunisia to rely on those co-ordinates as a fact
which was “unknown” to it for the purposes of Article 61, paragraph 1, of the
Statute. In the Fisheries case, in which the United Kingdom denied know-
ledge of a Norwegian Decree of 1869 concerning the delimitation of the
territorial sea, the Court observed that

“As a coastal State on the North Sea, greatly interested in the fisheries
in this area, as a maritime Power traditionally concerned with the law of
the sea and concerned particularly to defend the freedom of the seas, the
United Kingdom could not have been ignorant of the Decree of 1869.”
(I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 139, emphasis added.)

24. It should first be noted that the Resolution of the Council of
Ministers of 28 March 1968 was published both in the Libyan Official Ga-
zette (4 May 1968) and in Middle East Economic Survey (9 August 1968),
in the latter publication with the editorial explanation that it related to
“6846 sq. kms. of offshore acreage in the Zuara area near the Tunisian
border” (emphasis added). Secondly, in a Note of 13 April 1976 addressed
to Libya Tunisia stated that

“From 1968 onwards the Tunisian Government has contested the
concession No. 137 granted by the Libyan Government, since it extends
within the Tunisian continental shelf as defined by international law
and usage.”

The “Tunisian continental shelf” certainly included the areas within the
Tunisian permit, the co-ordinates of which were included in the material
before the Court in 1982 (though only in a form requiring some expert
knowledge to plot them on a map). In what way the Tunisian Government
had “contested” the Concession is not clear, since Libya's Note of
30 March 1976 stated that its concession limits had “encountered no oppo-
sition or reservation”. However, the reasonable and appropriate course of
action to be taken by Tunisia, in 1976 at the latest, would have been to seek to
know the co-ordinates of the Concession, so as to establish the precise extent
of the encroachment on what it regarded as Tunisian continental shelf.

25. Libya has pointed out that, although it is not its practice to publish
the co-ordinates of oil concessions granted by it, the Libyan Petroleum



Regulations of 1955 do provide for access by the public to the Petroleum
Register, and to status maps which show “the areas indicated in all pending
applications, the areas of all currently valid concessions and all open areas”.
Thus while the co-ordinates of Concession No. 137 were never published,
they were, according to Libya “readily obtainable in Tripoli”. It was also
possible, according to Libya, to obtain the information from the Libyan
National Oil Corporation. It has been shown by Libya in the present pro-
ceedings that an independent firm of consultants in the petroleum industry
was thus able to obtain the information in question in 1976 ; and Tunisia has
neither explained why it would not have been possible for it to do the same —
or indeed itself to apply to the firm of consultants in question — nor proved
that if it had made such approaches, they would have been unsuccessful.

26. In this respect Tunisia has urged that

“The Tunisian Government cannot be held negligent in any way, as
its representatives have vainly requested their Libyan counterparts to
communicate this text to them during the meetings between the two
sides ever since 1968.”

Libya, it should be observed, denies that such requests were made. However,
even if Tunisia’s assertion be accepted, it is clear from the Notes exchanged
between the Parties and produced to the Court, and not contested by Tunisia,
that Libya had expressed its willingness to assist Tunisia to obtain maps of
the area claimed by Libya ; Tunisia had been told that these maps had
already been published, registered and distributed and were available to all ;
but that Tunisia commented that it would have been “simpler” for the Libyan
Government itself to transmit the maps in ahstion to Tunisia. While it was
no doubt correct as a matter of diplomatic practice for Tunisia to invite the
Libyan Government to supply the relevant information, there was no reason
why Tunisia, particularly if it was not receiving from the Libyan Government
the co-operation which it apparently expected, should not employ other,
perfectly lawful and proper, means to obtain it.

27. Normal diligence would require that, when sending a delegation to
negotiate a continental shelf delimitation, following the grant by each side of
neighbouring or conflicting concessions, a State should first try to learn the
exact co-ordinates of the other party’s concession. Furthermore, it is to be
expected that a State would not assert that such concession extended to its
own area of continental shelf without knowing, or making efforts to discover,
the exact limits of the concession. It is also to be expected that, in litigation
the ultimate purpose of which is the establishment of a continental shelf
delimitation, and in the course of which a petroleum concession in the
relevant area is described by one party without precision, the other party will
not limit itself to commenting on the matter in its pleading, but itself seek out
the information.

28. The Court must therefore conclude that in the present case, the fact



that the concession boundary co-ordinates were obtainable by Tunisia, and
the fact that it was in its own interests to ascertain them, together signify that
one of the essential conditions of admissibility of a request for revision
laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 61 of the Statute, namely ignorance
of a new fact not due to negligence, is lacking. In view of this conclusion,
there is no need to enquire into the question whether the application
for revision was made within six months of the discovery of the fact of
the co-ordinates, as required by paragraph 4 of Article 61 of the
Statute.

29. There remains however a further requirement of Article 61, namely
that the fact, the discovery of which is relied on, must be “of such a nature as
to be a decisive factor”. Strictly speaking, once it is established that the
request for revision fails to meet one of the conditions for admissibility,
the Court is not required to go further and investigate whether the other
