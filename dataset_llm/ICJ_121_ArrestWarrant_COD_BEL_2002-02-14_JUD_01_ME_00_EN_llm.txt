13. On 11 April 2000 an investigating judge of the Brussels Tribunal
de premiére instance issued “an international arrest warrant in absentia”
against Mr. Abdulaye Yerodia Ndombasi, charging him, as perpetrator
or co-perpetrator, with offences constituting grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions of 1949 and of the Additional Protocols thereto, and with
crimes against humanity.

At the time when the arrest warrant was issued Mr. Yerodia was the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Congo.

14. The arrest warrant was transmitted to the Congo on 7 June 2000,
being received by the Congolese authorities on 1? July 2000. According
to Belgium, the warrant was at the same time transmitted to the Inter-
national Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), an organization
whose function is to enhance and facilitate cross-border criminal police
co-operation worldwide; through the latter, it was circulated interna-
tionally.

15. In the arrest warrant, Mr. Yerodia is accused of having made vari-
ous speeches inciting racial hatred during the month of August 1998. The
crimes with which Mr. Yerodia was charged were punishable in Belgium
under the Law of 16 June 1993 “concerning the Punishment of Grave
Breaches of the International Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949
and of Protocols I and II of 8 June 1977 Additional Thereto”, as
amended by the Law of 10 February 1999 “concerning the Punishment of
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law” (hereinafter
referred to as the “Belgian Law”).

Article 7 of the Belgian Law provides that “The Belgian courts shall
have jurisdiction in respect of the offences provided for in the present
Law, wheresoever they may have been committed”. In the present case,
according to Belgium, the complaints that initiated the proceedings as a
result of which the arrest warrant was issued emanated from 12 indivi-
duals all resident in Belgium, five of whom were of Belgian nationality.
It is not contested by Belgium, however, that th: alleged acts to which


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 10

the arrest warrant relates were committed outside Belgian territory, that
Mr. Yerodia was not a Belgian national at the time of those acts, and
that Mr. Yerodia was not in Belgian territory at the time that the arrest
warrant was issued and circulated. That no Belgian nationals were vic-
tims of the violence that was said to have resulted from Mr. Yerodia’s
alleged offences was also uncontested.

Article 5, paragraph 3, of the Belgian Law further provides that
“[({]mmunity attaching to the official capacity of a person shall not pre-
vent the application of the present Law”.

16. At the hearings, Belgium further claimed that it offered “to entrust
the case to the competent authorities [of the Congo] for enquiry and pos-
sible prosecution”, and referred to a certain number of steps which it
claimed to have taken in this regard from September 2000, that is, before
the filing of the Application instituting proceedings. The Congo for its
part stated the following: “We have scant information concerning the
form [of these Belgian proposals].” It added tha: “these proposals . . .
appear to have been made very belatedly, namely after an arrest warrant
against Mr. Yerodia had been issued”.

17. On 17 October 2000, the Congo filed in the Registry an Applica-
tion instituting the present proceedings (see paragraph | above), in which
the Court was requested “to declare that the Kingdom of Belgium shall
annul the international arrest warrant issued on 11 April 2000”. The
Congo relied in its Application on two separate legal grounds. First, it
claimed that “[t]he universal jurisdiction that the Belgian State attributes
to itself under Article 7 of the Law in question” constituted a

“[v]iolation of the principle that a State may not exercise its author-
ity on the territory of another State and of the principle of sovereign
equality among all Members of the United Nations, as laid down in
Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations”.

Secondly, it claimed that “[tlhe non-recognition, on the basis of
Article 5... of the Belgian Law, of the immunity of a Minister for For-
eign Affairs in office” constituted a “[v]iolation of the diplomatic immu-
nity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a sovereign State, as recog-
nized by the jurisprudence of the Court and following from Article 41,
paragraph 2, of the Vienna Convention of 18 Agril 1961 on Diplomatic
Relations”.

18. On the same day that it filed its Application instituting proceed-
ings, the Congo submitted a request to the Court for the indication of a
provisional measure under Article 41 of the Statute of the Court. During
the hearings devoted to consideration of that request, the Court was
informed that in November 2000 a ministerial reshuffie had taken place
in the Congo, following which Mr. Yerodia had :eased to hold office as
Minister for Foreign Affairs and had been entrusted with the portfolio of
Minister of Education. Belgium accordingly claimed that the Congo’s
Application had become moot and asked the Court, as has already been


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT, 11

recalled, to remove the case from the List. By Order of 8 December 2000,
the Court rejected both Belgium’s submissions to that effect and also the
Congo’s request for the indication of provisional measures (see para-
graph 4 above).

19. From mid-April 2001, with the formation of a new Government in
the Congo, Mr. Yerodia ceased to hold the post of Minister of Educa-
tion. He no longer holds any ministerial office today.

20. On 12 September 2001, the Belgian National Central Bureau of
Interpol requested the Interpol General Secretariat to issue a Red Notice
in respect of Mr. Yerodia. Such notices concern individuals whose arrest
is requested with a view to extradition. On 19 October 2001, at the public
sittings held to hear the oral arguments of the Partizs in the case, Belgium
informed the Court that Interpol had responded on 27 September 2001
with a request for additional information, and that no Red Notice had
yet been circulated.

21. Although the Application of the Congo originally advanced two
separate legal grounds (see paragraph 17 above), the submissions of the
Congo in its Memorial and the final submissions which it presented at the
end of the oral proceedings refer only to a violation “in regard to the . . .
Congo of the rule of customary international law concerning the absolute
inviolability and immunity from criminal process of incumbent foreign
ministers” (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above).

22. In their written pleadings, and in oral argument, the Parties
addressed issues of jurisdiction and admissibility as well as the merits (see
paragraphs 5 and 6 above). In this connection, Belgium raised certain
objections which the Court will begin by addressing.

* *

23. The first objection presented by Belgium reads as follows:

“That, in the light of the fact that Mr. Yerodia Ndombasi is no
longer either Minister for Foreign Affairs of the [Congo] or a min-
ister occupying any other position in the . . . Government [of the
Congo], there is no longer a ‘legal dispute’ between the Parties
within the meaning of this term in the Optional Clause Declarations
of the Parties and that the Court accordingly lacks jurisdiction in
this case.”

24. Belgium does not deny that such a legal dispute existed between
the Parties at the time when the Congo filed its Application instituting
proceedings, and that the Court was properly seised by that Application.
However, it contends that the question is not whether a legal dispute


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT 12

existed at that time, but whether a legal dispute exists at the present time.
Belgium refers in this respect inter alia to the Norihern Cameroons case,
in which the Court found that it “may pronounce judgment only in con-
nection with concrete cases where there exists at the time of the adjudica-
tion an actual controversy involving a conflict of legal interests between
the parties” (I. C.J. Reports 1963, pp. 33-34), as well as to the Nuclear
Tests cases (Australia v. France) ( New Zealand v. France), in which the
Court stated the following: “The Court, as a court of law, is called upon
to resolve existing disputes between States . . . The dispute brought
before it must therefore continue to exist at the time when the Court
makes its decision” (I.C.J. Reports 1974, pp. 270-271, para. 55; p. 476,
para. 58). Belgium argues that the position of Mr. Yerodia as Minister
for Foreign Affairs was central to the Congo's Application instituting
proceedings, and emphasizes that there has now be:n a change of circum-
stances at the very heart of the case, in view of the fact that Mr. Yerodia
was relieved of his position as Minister for Foreign Affairs in Novem-
ber 2000 and that, since 15 April 2001, he has occupied no position in the
Government of the Congo (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). According
to Belgium, while there may still be a difference cf opinion between the
Parties on the scope and content of internatioral law governing the
immunities of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, thai difference of opinion
has now become a matter of abstract, rather than of practical, concern.
The result, in Belgium’s view, is that the case has become an attempt by
the Congo to “[seek] an advisory opinion from the Court”, and no longer
a “concrete case” involving an “actual controversy” between the Parties,
and that the Court accordingly lacks jurisdiction in the case.

25. The Congo rejects this objection of Belgium It contends that there
is indeed a legal dispute between the Parties, in that the Congo claims
that the arrest warrant was issued in violation of the immunity of its
Minister for Foreign Affairs, that that warrant was unlawful ab initio,
and that this legal defect persists despite the subsequent changes in the
position occupied by the individual concerned, while Belgium maintains
that the issue and circulation of the arrest warrant were not contrary to
international law. The Congo adds that the termination of Mr. Yerodia’s
official duties in no way operated to efface the wrongful act and the
injury that flowed from it, for which the Congo continues to seek redress.

*

26. The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its
jurisdiction must be determined at the time that “he act instituting pro-
ceedings was filed. Thus, if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case
is referred to it, it continues to do so regardless of subsequent events.
Such events might lead to a finding that an application has subsequently


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT! 13

become moot and to a decision not to proceed to judgment on the merits,
but they cannot deprive the Court of jurisdiction (see Nottebohm,
Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122; Right of
Passage over Indian Territory, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J.
Reports 1957, p. 142; Questions of Interpretation and Application of the
1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, pp. 23-24, para. 38: and Questions of
Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising
from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United
States of America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports
1998, p. 129, para. 37).
27. Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court provides:

“The States parties to the present Statute may at any time declare
that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special
agreement, in relation to any other State accepting the same obliga-
tion, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning:

(a) the interpretation of a treaty;

(hb) any question of international law;

(ce) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
a breach of an international obligation;

(d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach
of an international obligation.”

On 17 October 2000, the date that the Congo’s Application instituting
these proceedings was filed, each of the Parties was bound by a declara-
tion of acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction, filed in accordance with
the above provision: Belgium by a declaration of 17 June 1958 and the
Congo by a declaration of 8 February 1989. Those declarations con-
tained no reservation applicable to the present case.

Moreover, it is not contested by the Parties that at the material time
there was a legal dispute between them concerning the international law-
fulness of the arrest warrant of 11 April 2000 and the consequences to be
drawn if the warrant was unlawful. Such a dispute was clearly a legal dis-
pute within the meaning of the Court’s jurisprudence, namely “a dis-
agreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests
between two persons” in which “the claim of cne party is positively
opposed by the other” (Questions of Interpretation and Application of the
1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aeriai Incident at Lockerbie
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriva v. United Kingdom), Freliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 17, para. 22; and Questions of Inter-
pretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from
the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United
States of America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1998, pp. 122-123, para. 21).

28. The Court accordingly concludes that at the time that it was seised


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 14

of the case it had jurisdiction to deal with it, and that it still has such
jurisdiction. Belgium's first objection must therefore be rejected.

* x

29. The second objection presented by Belgium is the following:

“That in the light of the fact that Mr. Yerodia Ndombasi is no
longer either Minister for Foreign Affairs of the [Congo] or a min-
ister occupying any other position in the . . Government [of the
Congo], the case is now without object and the Court should accord-
ingly decline to proceed to judgment on the merits of the case.”

30. Belgium also relies in support of this objection on the Northern
Cameroons case, in which the Court considered that it would not be a
proper discharge of its duties to proceed further in a case in which any
judgment that the Court might pronounce would be “without object”
(I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 38), and on the Nuclear Tests cases, in which the
Court saw “no reason to allow the continuance of proceedings which it
knows are bound to be fruitless” (1. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 271, para. 58;
p. 477, para. 61). Belgium maintains that the declarations requested by
the Congo in its first and second submissions would clearly fall within the
principles enunciated by the Court in those cases, since a judgment of the
Court on the merits in this case could only be directed towards the clari-
fication of the law in this area for the future, or be designed to reinforce
the position of one or other Party. It relies in support of this argument on
the fact that the Congo does not allege any material injury and is not
seeking compensatory damages. It adds that the issue and transmission
of the arrest warrant were not predicated on the ministerial status of the
person concerned, that he is no longer a minister, and that the case is
accordingly now devoid of object.

31. The Congo contests this argument of Belgium, and emphasizes
that the aim of the Congo — to have the disputed arrest warrant
annulled and to obtain redress for the moral injury suffered — remains
unachieved at the point in time when the Court is called upon to decide
the dispute. According to the Congo, in order for the case to have
become devoid of object during the proceedings, the cause of the viola-
tion of the right would have had to disappear, aid the redress sought
would have to have been obtained.

FY

32. The Court has already affirmed on a number of occasions that events
occurring subsequent to the filing of an application may render the applica-
tion without object such that the Court is not called 1pon to give a decision
thereon (see Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Mont-


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 15

real Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie ( Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, LC.J.
Reports 1998, p. 26, para. 46; and Questions of Inte-pretation and Applica-
tion of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at
Lockerbie ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 131, para. 45).

However, it considers that this is not such a case. The change which
has occurred in the situation of Mr. Yerodia has not in fact put an end to
the dispute between the Parties and has not deprived the Application of
its object. The Congo argues that the arrest warrant issued by the Belgian
judicial authorities against Mr. Yerodia was and remains unlawful, It
asks the Court to hold that the warrant is unlawful, thus providing
redress for the moral injury which the warrant allegedly caused to it. The
Congo also continues to seek the cancellation of the warrant. For its
part, Belgium contends that it did not act in violation of international
law and it disputes the Congo’s submissions. In the view of the Court, it
follows from the foregoing that the Application of the Congo is not now
without object and that accordingly the case is not moot. Belgium's
second objection must accordingly be rejected.

* *

33. The third Belgian objection is put as follows:

“That the case as it now stands is materially different to that set
out in the [Congo]’s Application instituting proceedings and that the
Court accordingly lacks jurisdiction in the case and/or that the appli-
cation is inadmissible.”

34. According to Belgium, it would be contrary to legal security and
the sound administration of justice for an applicant State to continue
proceedings in circurnstances in which the factua! dimension on which
the Application was based has changed fundamentally, since the respond-
ent State would in those circumstances be uncertain, until the very last
moment, of the substance of the claims against it. Belgium argues that
the prejudice suffered by the respondent State in this situation is analo-
gous to the situation in which an applicant State formulates new claims
during the course of the proceedings. It refers to the jurisprudence of the
Court holding inadmissible new claims formulated during the course of
the proceedings which, had they been entertained, would have trans-
formed the subject of the dispute originally brought before it under the
terms of the Application (see Fisheries Jurisdiction ( Spain v. Canada),
Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1998, pp. 447-448,
para. 29). In the circumstances, Belgium contends that, if the Congo
wishes to maintain its claims, it should be required to initiate proceedings
afresh or, at the very least, apply to the Court for p:rmission to amend its
initial Application.



ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 16

35. In response, the Congo denies that there has been a substantial
amendment of the terms of its Application, and :nsists that it has pre-
sented no new claim, whether of substance or of form, that would have
transformed the subject-matter of the dispute. The Congo maintains that
it has done nothing through the various stages tn the proceedings but
“condense and refine” its claims, as do most States that appear before the
Court, and that it is simply making use of the right of parties to amend
their submissions until the end of the oral proceecings.

*

36. The Court notes that, in accordance with settled jurisprudence, it
“cannot, in principle, allow a dispute brought befcre it by application to
be transformed by amendments in the submissions into another dispute
which is different in character” (Société commerciale de Belgique, Judg-
ment, 1939, P.C.LJ., Series AIB, No. 78, p. 173; f. Military and Para-
military Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nica-agua v. United States
of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judzment, LC.J. Reports
1984, p. 427, para. 80; see also Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru
(Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, LC.J. Reports
1992, pp. 264-267, in particular paras. 69 and 70. However, the Court
considers that in the present case the facts underlying the Application
have not changed in a way that produced such a transformation in the
dispute brought before it. The question submitted to the Court for deci-
sion remains whether the issue and circulation of the arrest warrant by
the Belgian judicial authorities against a person who was at that time the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Congo were contrary to international
law. The Congo’s final submissions arise “directly out of the question
which is the subject-matter of that Application” (Fisheries Jurisdiction
(Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Me-its, Judgment, T.C.J.
Reports 1974, p. 203, para. 72; see also Temple of Preah Vihear, Merits,
Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1962, p. 36).

In these circumstances, the Court considers that Belgium cannot
validly maintain that the dispute brought before the Court was trans-
formed in a way that affected its ability to prepare its defence, or that
the requirements of the sound administration of justice were infringed.
Belgium’s third objection must accordingly be rejected.

*

37. The fourth Belgian objection reads as follows:

“That, in the light of the new circumstances concerning Mr. Yero-
dia Ndombasi, the case has assumed the character of an action of
diplomatic protection but one in which the individual being pro-


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 17

tected has failed to exhaust local remedies, and that the Court
accordingly lacks jurisdiction in the case and/or that the application
is inadmissible.”

38. In this respect, Belgium accepts that, when the case was first msti-
tuted, the Congo had a direct legal interest in the matter, and was assert-
ing a claim in its own name in respect of the alleged violation by Belgium
of the immunity of the Congo’s Foreign Minister. However, according to
Belgium, the case was radically transformed after the Application was
filed, namely on 15 April 2001, when Mr. Yerodia ceased to be a member
of the Congolese Government. Belgium maintains that two of the requests
made of the Court in the Congo’s final submissions in practice now con-
cern the legal effect of an arrest warrant issued aga nst a private citizen of
the Congo, and that these issues fall within the rea m of an action of dip-
lomatic protection. It adds that the individual concerned has not
exhausted all available remedies under Belgian law a necessary condition
before the Congo can espouse the cause of one of its nationals in inter-
national proceedings.

39. The Congo, on the other hand, denies that this is an action for
diplomatic protection. It maintains that it is bringing these proceedings
in the name of the Congolese State, on account of the violation of the
immunity of its Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Congo further denies
the availability of remedies under Belgian law. It points out in this regard
that it is only when the Crown Prosecutor has become seised of the case
file and makes submissions to the Chambre du conseil that the accused
can defend himself before the Chambre and seek 10 have the charge dis-
missed.

*

40. The Court notes that the Congo has never sought to invoke before
it Mr. Yerodia’s personal rights. It considers that, despite the change in
professional situation of Mr. Yerodia, the character of the dispute sub-
mitted to the Court by means of the Application has not changed: the
dispute still concerns the lawfulness of the arrèst warrant issued on
11 April 2000 against a person who was at the time Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the Congo, and the question whether the rights of the Congo
have or have not been violated by that warrant. As the Congo is not act-
ing in the context of protection of one of its nationals, Belgium cannot
rely upon the rules relating to the exhaustion of local remedies.

In any event, the Court recalls that an objection based on non-exhaus-
tion of local remedies relates to the admissibility of the application (see
Interhandel, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1959,
p. 26: Elettronica Sicula S.p. A. (ELSI), Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1989,
p. 42, para. 49). Under settled jurisprudence, the critical date for deter-
mining the admissibility of an application is the date on which it is filed


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 18

(see Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal
Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1. C.J.
Reports 1998, pp. 25-26, paras. 43-44; and Questions of Interpretation
and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial
Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriye v. United States of
America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, C.J. Reports 1998,
pp. 130-131, paras. 42-43). Belgium accepts that, on the date on which
the Congo filed the Application instituting proceecings, the Congo had a
direct legal interest in the matter, and was asserting a claim in its own
name. Belgium's fourth objection must accordingly be rejected.

* *

41. As a subsidiary argument, Belgium further contends that “[ijn the
event that the Court decides that it does have jurisdiction in this case and
that the application is admissible, . . . the non ultra petita rule operates to
limit the jurisdiction of the Court to those issues that are the subject of
the [Congo]’s final submissions”. Belgium points out that, while the
Congo initially advanced a twofold argument, based, on the one hand,
on the Belgian judge’s lack of jurisdiction, and, on the other, on the
immunity from jurisdiction enjoyed by its Minister for Foreign Affairs,
the Congo no longer claims in its final submissions that Belgium wrongly
conferred upon itself universal jurisdiction in absentia. According to Bel-
gium, the Congo now confines itself to arguing that the arrest warrant of
11 April 2000 was unlawful because it violated the immunity from juris-
diction of its Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that the Court conse-
quently cannot rule on the issue of universal jurisdiction in any decision
it renders on the merits of the case.

42. The Congo, for its part, states that its interest in bringing these
proceedings is to obtain a finding by the Court that it has been the victim
of an internationally wrongful act, the question whether this case involves
the “exercise of an excessive universal jurisdiction’ being in this connec-
tion only a secondary consideration. The Congo asserts that any consid-
eration by the Court of the issues of international aw raised by universal
jurisdiction would be undertaken not at the request of the Congo but,
rather, by virtue of the defence strategy adopted by Belgium, which
appears to maintain that the exercise of such jurisdiction can “represent a
valid counterweight to the observance of immunities”.

*

43. The Court would recall the well-established principle that “it is the
duty of the Court not only to reply to the questions as stated in the final
submissions of the parties, but also to abstain from deciding points not
included in those submissions” (Asylum, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1950,


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMENT) 19

p. 402). While the Court is thus not entitled to decide upon questions not
asked of it, the non ultra petita rule nonetheless cannot preclude the
Court from addressing certain legal points in its reasoning. Thus in the
present case the Court may not rule, in the operative part of its Judg-
ment, on the question whether the disputed arrest warrant, issued by the
Belgian investigating judge in exercise of his purported universal jurisdic-
tion, complied in that regard with the rules and principles of interna-
tional law governing the jurisdiction of national courts. This does not
mean, however, that the Court may not deal with certain aspects of that
question in the reasoning of its Judgment, shoulc it deem this necessary
or desirable.

* ok

44. The Court concludes from the foregoing that it has jurisdiction to
entertain the Congo’s Application, that the Application is not without
object and that accordingly the case is not moot and that the Applica-
tion is admissible. Thus, the Court now turns to the merits of the case.

x * +

45. As indicated above (see paragraphs 41 to 4: above), in its Applica-
tion instituting these proceedings, the Congo originally challenged the
legality of the arrest warrant of 11 April 2000 on two separate grounds:
on the one hand, Belgium’s claim to exercise a universal jurisdiction and,
on the other, the alleged violation of the immunities of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the Congo then in office. However, in its submissions
in its Memorial, and in its final submissions at the close of the oral pro-
ceedings, the Congo invokes only the latter ground.

46. As a matter of logic, the second ground should be addressed only
once there has been a determination in respect of the first, since it is only
where a State has jurisdiction under international law in relation to a par-
ticular matter that there can be any question of immunities in regard to
the exercise of that jurisdiction. However, in the present case, and in view
of the final form of the Congo’s submissions, the Court will address first
the question whether, assuming that it had jurisdiction under interna-
tional law to issue and circulate the arrest warrant of 11 April 2000, Bel-
gium in so doing violated the immunities of the then Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the Congo.

* x

47. The Congo maintains that, during his or her term of office, a Min-
ister for Foreign Affairs of a sovereign State is entitled to inviolability


ARREST WARRANT (JUDGMEN") 20

and to immunity from criminal process being “absolute or complete”,
that is to say, they are subject to no exception. Accordingly, the Congo
contends that no criminal prosecution may be brought against a Minister
for Foreign Affairs in a foreign court as long as he or she remains in
office, and that any finding of criminal responsibility by a domestic court
in a foreign country, or any act of investigation undertaken with a view
to bringing him or her to court, would contravene the principle of immu-
nity from jurisdiction. According to the Congo, the basis of such criminal
immunity is purely functional, and immunity is accorded under custom-
ary international law simply in order to enable the foreign State repre-
sentative enjoying such immunity to perform his or her functions freely
and without let or hindrance. The Congo adds that the immunity thus
accorded to Ministers for Foreign Affairs when in office covers all their
acts, including any committed before they took office, and that it is irrele-
vant whether the acts done whilst in office may be characterized or not as
“official acts”.

48. The Congo states further that it does not deny the existence of a
principle of international criminal law, deriving from the decisions of the
Nuremberg and Tokyo international military tribunals, that the accused’s
official capacity at the time of the acts cannot, before any court, whether
domestic or international, constitute a “ground of exemption from his
criminal responsibility or a ground for mitigation of sentence”. The
Congo then stresses that the fact that an immunity might bar prosecution
before a specific court or over a specific period coes not mean that the
same prosecution cannot be brought, if appropriate, before another court
which is not bound by that immunity, or at another time when the immu-
nity need no longer be taken into account. It concludes that immunity
does not mean impunity.

49. Belgium maintains for its part that, while Ministers for Foreign
