                 ical miles from their respective coasts. The Court rightly found that these
                 declarations had not established any maritime boundary between the Par-
                 ties.

                 para. 49). The Court recognizes that this Declaration has the character of
                 a treaty, but concludes,
                      “contrary to Chile’s submissions, that Chile and Peru did not, by
                      adopting the 1952 Santiago Declaration, agree to the establishment
                      of a lateral maritime boundary between them along the line of latitude
                      running into the Pacific Ocean from the seaward terminus of their
                      land boundary” (ibid., para. 70).
                    I agree also with that finding.

                 easy to interpret. It is clear, as the Court noted, that the 1954 Agreement
                 had a “narrow and specific” purpose (Judgment, para. 103). The same
                 applies to the arrangements of 1968-1969. But it is equally clear that they
                 were referring to a “boundary”. They were not establishing such a bound-
                 ary, but noted its existence running along the line of latitude.
                    8. That boundary had not, moreover, been established either by the
                 unilateral proclamations of 1947, or by the Santiago Declaration, or by
                 any other treaty text. It could thus only derive from a tacit agreement
                 reached between the Parties before 1954.





5 CIJ1057.indb 243                                                                                   1/12/14 08:59

                                    maritime dispute (decl. guillaume)                      123

                    9. The Court has always recognized the possibility that States may
                 enter into such agreements, but this is an area where the very greatest
                 caution is required. Indeed, as the Court has stated : “[t]he establishment
                 of a permanent maritime boundary is a matter of grave importance and
                 agreement is not easily to be presumed” (Territorial and Maritime Dispute
                 between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v.
                 Honduras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 735, para. 253). “Evi-
                 dence of a tacit legal agreement must be compelling.” (Ibid.)
                    10. In the present case, the existence of a tacit agreement prior to 1954
                 is evidenced by the 1954 Agreement itself, and by the arrangements of
                 1968-1969. The boundary recognized in those texts follows the parallel of
                 latitude passing through Boundary Marker No. 1. On the other hand, the
                 texts give no indication as to how far that boundary extends out to sea,
                 and the Parties disagree on this.
                    11. The 1954 Agreement and the 1968-1969 arrangements essentially
                 concerned fishing by small vessels close to the coast, and Chile has failed
                 to show that the boundary whose existence was recognized by the Parties
                 in those texts extended along the parallel of latitude beyond the area in
                 which those vessels operated. It was within that area that a boundary was
                 recognized.
                    12. The Parties have provided few indications as to the extent of the
                 area in question. However, it is apparent that
                      “the principal maritime activity in the early 1950s was fishing under-
                      taken by small vessels, such as those specifically mentioned in the 1954
                      Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement and which were also to
                      benefit from the 1968‑1969 arrangements relating to the lighthouses”
                      (Judgment, para. 109). 

                 Such activities were limited, and concentrated within the areas close to
                 the coast (ibid., paras. 107 and 108). It is also clear from the case file that
                 “[u]ntil the mid‑1980s, all the practice involving incidents between the
                 two Parties was within about 60 nautical miles of the coasts and usually
                 much closer” (ibid., para. 128).
                    13. In these circumstances, it seems to me that Chile has failed to show
                 that the boundary deriving from the tacit agreement between the Parties,
                 as confirmed by the 1954 Agreement and the 1968-1969 arrangements,
                 extended beyond 60 to 80 nautical miles from the coasts. This latter figure
                 marks the furthest limit of the boundary deriving from the tacit agreement
                 of the Parties, and it is in light of that fact that I have been able to agree
                 with the solution adopted in paragraph 3 of the Judgment’s operative part.

                    14. Beyond that point as thus determined by the Court, it was for the
                 latter to determine the maritime boundary between the two States in
                 accordance with the customary law of the sea as identified in its jurispru-
                 dence. In that regard, I agree fully with the method followed. I likewise
                 agree with the Court’s reasoning and with the result as regards the outer

                 triangle, over which Peru is entitled to exercise sovereign rights under the
                 conditions laid down by international law.
                      15. Finally, I agree with the solution reached by the Court as regards
                 the starting‑point of the maritime boundary. This solution followed
                 ­necessarily from the language of the arrangements of 1968-1969. However,
                  it in no way prejudges “the location of the starting-point of the land bound­
                  ary identified as ‘Concordia’ in Article 2 of the 1929 Treaty of Lima”,
                  which it was not for the Court to determine (Judgment, para. 163). The
                  Parties disagree as to the location of that point, and for my part I tend to
                  believe that it is located not at Boundary Marker No. 1, which is situated
                  inland, but at “the point of intersection between the Pacific Ocean and an
                  arc with a radius of 10 km having its centre on the bridge over the river
                  Lluta” (see the Parties’ “Joint Instructions” of April 1930, ibid., para. 154).
                  Accordingly, the coast between the starting‑point of the maritime bound-
                  ary and Point Concordia falls under the sovereignty of Peru, whilst the
                  sea belongs to Chile. However, that situation is not unprecedented, as
                  Chile pointed out at the hearings (CR 2012/31, pp. 35‑38) ; it concerns
                  just a few tens of metres of shoreline, and it may be hoped that it will not
                  give rise to any difficulties.
