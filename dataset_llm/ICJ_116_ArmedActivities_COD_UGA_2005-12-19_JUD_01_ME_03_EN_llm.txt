  1. Although I have voted in favour of most of the findings of the
Court as reflected in the dispositif, I nevertheless feel constrained to make
the following remarks. My main difficulty with the present Judgment is a
certain lack of balance in the description of the dispute and of the rele-
vant facts even if the conclusions drawn are in my view in general legally
correct. I will therefore start with a number of general remarks and sub-
sequently deal with certain legal issues with regard to which I would have
preferred a different approach.

      tivity in the face of confusing and contradictory evidence is particu-
      larly difficult . . . Moreover, the results are likely to be tentative,
      partial and complex, and therefore less than totally satisfying. One is
      more likely to end with a ‘thick description’ of a complex episode
      than a ‘scientific’ explanation of a discrete social event.” 1


   3. These cautious words of a social scientist are of limited use for a
court of justice which has to evaluate the legality of certain specific activi-
ties which have been put before it. The task of a judicial body does not
allow it to conclude with a “thick description” of a complex episode but
compels it to come to a clear and unequivocal determination of the legal
consequences of acts committed during that “complex episode”.

   4. However, in order to make its legal assessments and conclusions
comprehensible and thereby acceptable to litigant States whose leaders
are no trained lawyers (even though they may be assisted by legal pro-
fessionals), but are the main actors in the process of implementing the
judgment, a court should make clear in its reasoning that it is fully aware
of the wider context and the complexity of the issues involved. A judg-
ment which is not seen as logical and fair in its historical, political and
social dimensions runs the risk of being one compliance with which will
be difficult for the parties.

   5. The Parties to the present dispute share a hapless post-decoloniza-
tion history. They have been in the grip of merciless dictatorships which
elicited violent resistance and armed rebellions. The overthrow of these
dictatorships (in Uganda in 1986 and the Congo in 1997) did not bring
internal stability ; armed groups, either loyal to the previous régime or
pursuing goals of their own and operating from remote parts of their own
territory or from abroad continued to threaten the new leadership. In this
respect the Parties shared the plight which seems to have become endemic
in much of the African continent : régimes under constant threat from
armed movements often operating from the territory of neighbouring
States, whose Governments sometimes support such movements but often
merely tolerate them since they do not have the means to control or repel
them. The latter case is one where a Government lacks power and conse-
quently fails to exercise effectively its territorial authority ; in short, there
is a partial failure of State authority and such failure is badly concealed
by the formal performance of State functions on the international level.
Commitments entered into by Governments unable to implement them

African Studies, Vol. 39 (2001), p. 262.




are unworthy of reliance from the very start and hardly contribute to the
creation of more stability.


  6. Under such circumstances, the ruling powers may feel left to their
own resources. In order to fight the armed movements operating from
abroad, usually by carrying out hit and run tactics, they often engage in
a kind of hot pursuit onto neighbouring territory since diplomatic
démarches have no effect. They may, moreover, lack all confidence in the
good intentions of the neighbour Government in spite of its commit-
ments and this may, in turn, induce them to support opposition move-
ments seeking to overthrow that “untrustworthy” Government.


   7. And so the circle is closed and we find ourselves confronted with a
pattern which is so typical for post-Cold War Africa : Governments, har-
assed by armed rebel movements often operating from foreign territory,
trying to improve their security by meddling in the affairs of neighbour-
ing States ; Governments, moreover, which have sometimes come to
power through external intervention themselves but which, once in power,
turn against their former supporters in order to become master in their
own house and to strengthen their grip on the internal situation.
   8. Needless to say, such chronic instability and the ensuing incessant
practice of unrestrained violence lead to immense human suffering. The
human disaster in Rwanda in 1994 is an extreme example, genocidal in
dimension, of a much more general pattern of gross violations of human
rights by warring factions and authorities trying to remain in power.


   9. The organized international community has thus far been unable to
provide structural assistance, necessary to strengthen State institutions,
and has thus failed to lay the basis for an improved security system in the
region. It has mainly limited itself to monitoring the situation, providing
a sometimes robust, but more often impotent, peace-keeping assistance in
war-stricken areas, and to furnishing humanitarian assistance.

   10. It is within this framework that the dispute before the Court must
be placed. It is not necessary to describe in detail the crisis as it developed
since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda nor to demonstrate how an increasing
number of States, in the Great Lakes region and even beyond, became
involved. These events have been well documented in various articles and
in a great number of reports from United Nations agencies and non-
governmental organizations 2. Suffice it to say that the Congo’s eastern

External Sabotage ?”, The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 37 (1999), pp. 53-82 ;




border area, a “line of political instability on which the future of
central Africa may well hinge” (as it was aptly called by David Shearer),
occupied a central place in the crisis. The overall picture is moreover
obfuscated by the fact that, apart from the Governments involved, an
even greater number of insurgent movements, sometimes controlled by
Governments but more often with shifting alliances, determined and
determine the situation on the ground.

   11. Is it possible to extract from this tangled web one element, to iso-
late it, to subject it to legal analysis and to arrive at a legal assessment as
to its consequences for the relations between only two of the parties
involved ? A court mandated by its Statute to decide disputes between
States whenever it has jurisdiction to do so cannot refrain from carrying
out that mandate on the ground that its judgment would only cover one
dispute which is indissolubly linked to the overall conflict. The system of
international judicial dispute settlement is premised on the existence of a
series of bilateral inter-State disputes, artificial as this sometimes may be,
as became clear, for example, in the Legality of the Use of Force cases
(the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia versus ten individual Member States
of NATO).

   12. In a slightly different context (different in that the dispute before
the Court was said to represent “a marginal and secondary aspect of an
overall problem” between the Parties) the Court stated that “no provi-
sion of the Statute or Rules contemplates that the Court should decline
to take cognizance of one aspect of a dispute merely because that dispute
has other aspects, however important”. In the present case the latter part
of the sentence could be paraphrased as “merely because that dispute is
intricately linked to a much wider problem which involves other parties
as well”. The Court went on to say that


      “never has the view been put forward that, because a legal dispute
      submitted to the Court is only one aspect of a political dispute, the
      Court should decline to resolve for the parties the legal question at
      issue between them . . . ; if the Court were, contrary to its settled
      jurisprudence, to adopt such a view, it would impose a far-reaching

      ful solution of international disputes” (United States Diplomatic and
      Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 20,

   13. The last part of this quotation illustrates the important place
assigned by the Charter to the Court in the context of the peaceful
settlement of disputes, as is clear from Article 36, paragraph 3, in
Chapter VI on the Pacific Settlement of Disputes. The concept of peaceful
dispute settlement is premised on the condition that the parties to a dis-
pute find their particular position and their specific concerns reflected in
the settlement suggested to or imposed upon them. That settlement must
acknowledge those concerns, even if it fails to satisfy the parties’ demands
or even censures their conduct.
   14. I regret that the Judgment of the Court in my view falls short of
meeting the standard just mentioned. It inadequately reflects the struc-
tural instability and insecurity in the region, the overall pattern of law-
lessness and disorder and the reprehensible behaviour of all parties
involved. A reading of the Judgment cannot fail to leave the impression
that the dispute is first and foremost a dispute between two neighbouring
States about the use of force and the ensuing excesses, perpetrated by one
of them. A two-dimensional picture may correctly depict the object
shown but it lacks depth and therefore does not reflect reality in full.


   15. It is true that in paragraph 26 the Court states that it is aware of
the complexity of the situation which has prevailed in the Great Lakes
region and that the instability in the DRC has had negative security
implications for Uganda and other neighbouring States.
   It is also true that in paragraph 221 the Court observes that the actions
of the various Parties in the complex conflict have contributed to the
immense suffering faced by the Congolese population.
   But in my view this awareness is insufficiently reflected in the Court’s
consideration of the various claims of the Parties. I will try to demon-
strate this in the sections of this opinion dealing with the right of self-
defence as claimed by Uganda (see B below), Uganda’s first counter-
claim (see E below) and Uganda’s breach of its obligations under the
Order on provisional measures (see D below).




                             B. USE OF FORCE
                            AND SELF-DEFENCE


  16. I am in full agreement with the Court that, as from the beginning
of August 1998, Uganda could, for the presence of its forces on Congo-




lese territory, no longer rely on the consent given by the DRC and that its
military activities from that time on thus can only be considered in the
light of the right of self-defence (Judgment, para. 106).

   17. In the preceding months the initially warm relations between the
Presidents of the DRC and Uganda had soured. In that same period the
frequency and intensity of attacks by Ugandan rebel movements oper-
ating from Congolese territory had increased. In less than two months
five attacks of a serious nature, in which a considerable number of
civilians were killed or abducted, had taken place (Judgment, para. 132).
A reoccurrence of the chronic instability of the pre-1997 period was, in
particular after the outbreak of a rebellion against President Kabila on
2 August, certainly not beyond the realm of possibility.

   18. Uganda chose to react by stepping up its military activities on the
Congolese side of the border. During the month of August the UPDF
successively took the towns and airports of Beni, Bunia and Watsa, “all
in close proximity to the border”. I fully agree with the Court when it
states that these actions were of a different nature from previous opera-
tions along the common border under the informal bilateral agreement
(Judgment, para. 110). They were military assaults which could only be
justified under the law of self-defence.

  19. Uganda has claimed that the Congolese authorities were actively
supporting the Ugandan rebels in carrying out their attacks but the
Court has not been able to find “satisfactory proof of the involvement in
these attacks, direct or indirect, of the Government of the DRC”. It thus
found that these attacks could not be attributed to the DRC and I cannot
fault this finding. (Judgment, para. 146.)

   20. The Court consequently finds that “[f]or all these reasons . . . the
legal and factual circumstances for the exercise of the right of self-defence
by Uganda against the DRC were not present”. Then follows, however, a
sentence which is not altogether clear :

        “Accordingly, the Court has no need to respond to the con-
      tentions of the Parties as to whether and under what conditions
      contemporary international law provides for a right of self-
      defence against large-scale attacks by irregular forces.” (Judgment,
