As it arises for the Court, the problem to be resolved derives from
the interpretation of a treaty. The principles involved are well

known; they have been established by doctrine and, on many
occasions, by the decisions of the Permanent Court and of our own
Court. Certain suppositions have been put forward by the Parties
in the pleadings and oral arguments in the case with a view to ex-
plaining seemingly strange situations. But the Court need not
dwell upon these suppositions, for a judgment cannot adopt a
capricious interpretation, nor found its view of the evolution of
events on venturesome hypotheses. Judgment must be given on the
basis of recognized facts which are founded on legal data.

The principal legal instrument in this case is the Maastricht
Boundary Convention already mentioned, which regulates a terri-
torial status quo as it existed at the date of signature. This regu-
lation deals legally with a situation of fact which can and should be
noted, but not changed. The Boundary Commissioners appointed
by virtue of the Treaty signed at London on 19 April 1839 had a
specific task, which cannot be distorted. They were a technical
body and not a judicial commission. The frontier plots under
Netherlands authority then belonged to the Netherlands, and those
under Belgian authority to Belgium. It is a question of factual
verification, and not one of enumerative description or graphical
reproduction—since the Convention in question is in fact accom-
panied by a Descriptive Minute, and Article go of that document
establishes that plots or and 92 form part of the commune of Baerle-
Duc.

The Descriptive Minute is also borne out by a map which was
signed by the plenipotentiary delegates of the two countries. As a
result of this description, the said map, or any other document,
which might be the consequence of a mistake in numbering, would
be of highly doubtful value. One is aware, moreover, of the value—
the very relative value—which international law attaches to geo-
graphical maps. This was made sufficiently clear in the Award of
arbitrator Max Huber in the Island of Palmas case (see United
Nations, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. II, pp.
852-854).

But this Descriptive Minute is supposed to transcribe “word for
word”, as the Boundary Commissioners decided at their 251st
meeting, what was previously indicated in the Communal Minute
drawn up in 1841. To transcribe “word for word” is not a simple
directive but involves compliance with a clear and precise obliga-
tion: that of transcribing ne varietur a definite text, and not of
changing, whether deliberately or by a clerical error, the status juris
of two territorial plots. And this Communal Minute states the
contrary of what the Descriptive Minute affirms: the plots belong
to Baarle-Nassau. Was this a mistake, or an intentional rectification
made by the Boundary Commissioners in Article go of the Des-
criptive Minute? If it was a rectification, the Boundary Com-
missioners had in no way the power to make it, and, even if they
had that power, they should have expressed themselves in a clear


FRONTIER LAND (DISS. OP. JUDGE MORENO QUINTANA) 255

and categorical fashion in the same document in which they gave
the result of their work.

Moreover, the Communal Minute merely notes the existing
situation of fact. Holland, ever since she historically constituted an
independent State, and not Belgium, is the Power which exercised
sovereignty over the plots in question. That situation is even more
significant if regard be had for the fact that it is manifested as
pertaining to the exercise of a legitimate authority, after the sig-
nature of the Convention of 1843, of which it seems merely to be a
natural consequence. It is Holland which accorded the use of the
heathlands and collected the land tax on the plots, entered in its
registers private legal acts occurring within the area, was respon-
sible for the communal administration of the said plots, applied
its national legislation to them, and in 1886 arranged for a forced
expropriation affecting them. In 1853, Holland even proceeded to
the sale—as domina terrarum—of plot No. 91. Such a legal act, in
so far as it has a character jure gestionis, pertains to the power of a
State, and not of a private person. And such facts are so striking—
they are self-evident—that in my view they remove all doubt as
to the legitimacy of Netherlands sovereignty over the plots in
question.

decisions in the well-known cases of the Banks of Grisbadarna
(see Hague Court Reports, pp. 130-132), of the Island of Palmas (see
U. N. Reports, etc, Vol. II, p. 870), of the Island of Clipperton (see
U. N. Reports, etc., Vol. II, pp. 1109-1110), of the Legal Status of
Eastern Greenland (see P.C.I.J., Judgments, etc., Series A/B, No. 53,
PP. 45-46) and of the Minquiers and Ecrehos (see Z.C.J. Reports
1953, p- 65). Belgium, which was not separated from Holland until
1831, has since that date, and up to 1921 perhaps—almost a cen-
tury—made no formal protest against the exercise of sovereignty
by the other country. It could clearly not do so because the pos-
session exercised by the Netherlands was in no way a defective one
and was based upon an incontestable legal title: Article 14, para-
graph 5, of the Maastricht Convention, which established the status
quo. It was a possession exercised in all good faith, with the animus
domini which characterizes a situation of this kind and which the
law protects. Let us recall, moreover, the well-known principle of
uti possidetis in Book XLIII, Chapter 17, paragraph I, of the Digest:
“As you possess, you shall continue to possess.”

If a provision such as that of Article 14, paragraph 5, of the
Maastricht Convention provides for the maintenance of a situation


FRONTIER LAND (DISS. OP. JUDGE MORENO QUINTANA) 256

of fact, if this situation of fact is contrary to the stipulations of a
Minute which forms part of the Convention and to the attestation
on a map drawn up to this effect; if, moreover, this Minute is in
flagrant contradiction with the document on which it should be
based, it is clearly the interpretation of the Convention which
should prevail in the mind of the international judge. On this
question, the Award of Arbitrator Lardy on the delimitation of the
Island of Timor lays down clearly that the real intention of the
Parties prevails over an erroneous terminology (see Hague Court
Reports, p. 362), and the Advisory Opinion given by the Permanent
Court on the conditions of labour in agriculture stated that a treaty
must be read as a whole and not on the basis of phrases detached
from their context (see Judgmenis, etc., Series B, Nos. 2 and 3, p. 23).
For, that Article go of the Descriptive Minute in question can consti-
tute, by its text alone, a source of territorial sovereignty is an idea
legally unacceptable. And, in the present case, this sovereignty can
only flow from two elements: the text of the Boundary Convention
and the resulting situation of fact. It is they which give the key to
the interpretation of the said instrument.

In the Maastricht Convention, the delimitation of the two Baarles
is a very special case. Article 1 of this Convention establishes the
frontier “in an exact and invariable way” save—and this is an
exception—for the communes of Baerle-Duc and Baarle-Nassau,
in respect of which—so runs the text—"the status quo shall be
maintained in virtue of Article 14 of the Treaty of 5 November
1842’. According to Article 14, paragraph 5, of the Convention of
Maastricht, the negotiators agreed that a continuous linear deli-
mitation was practically impossible and that such delimitation was
the subject of a “special study”. Now, this special study was never
carried out, since the simple enumeration in Article go of the Descrip-
tive Minute cannot be regarded as such. What falls for interpretation
is the meaning of the Treaty and this can only be the maintenance of
the status quo on the basis of a document —the Communal Minute of
1841—the authenticity of which has not béen questioned by the
Parties. In producing it in this case, the Netherlands has discharged
its obligation as to the burden of proof resting on each of the Parties
under Article II of the Special Agreement submitted to the Court
and in accordance with the law laid down by the Court in the Min-
quiers and Ecrehos case (see Reports 1953, p. 52). Belgium—
which has not produced its copy—must, in accordance with a well-
known principle of procedure, bear the consequences of its negli-
gence. This reasoning, which is clear and categorical, leads naturally
to the conclusion that the Descriptive Minute accompanying the
Maastricht Convention has no more value, in Article go, than that
of an incorrect copy of the Communal Minute.

also be inferred in the present case from the minutes of the meetings
of the Boundary Commissioners of the Parties. The Permanent
Court has given a very clear idea of the importance of preparatory
work for the interpretation of treaties in its Advisory Opinion on the
treatment of Polish nationals in Danzig (see Judgments, etc.,
Series A/B, No. 44, p. 33). In the Annex to the Minute of the 251st
meeting held on 12 June 1843 by the Boundary Commissioners, it
was stated that the Communal Minute of 1841 was “transcribed,
word for word, in the present Article”. Such a statement on the
part of the Mixed Commission, which consisted of the Boundary
Commissioners, gives a definite decision regarding the plots in
question. It is a direct consequence of the earlier decision adopted
by that Commission at its 225th meeting (4 April 1843), which
acknowledged the full value of this Communal Minute by allotting
the disputed plots to Holland, at the same time annulling—in
substituting for them the stateruents of an authentic document—
the provisions adopted at the 175th and 176th meetings.

It is, however, necessary to draw attention to the existence of an
indisputable clerical error in the Descriptive Minute, when it allots
the disputed plots to Baerle-Duc. This error is so obvious that it is
only necessary for the Court to observe its existence; and this
observation is inescapable. How this error may have come to be
made is not a matter which interests the Court. An international
court of justice is not called upon to make police enquiries. For the
same reason, the Court need not consider other hypotheses, as
strange as the one put forward by Counsel for Belgium, to the


FRONTIER LAND (DISS. OP. JUDGE MORENO QUINTANA) 258

effect that the copyist of the Communal Minute of 1841 omitted
two lines of a supposed earlier list and thus, in running the text
together, attributed the plots to Baarle-Nassau.

A mistake of fact—as the most qualified writers in international
law teach us—vitiates the consent of the Parties to a legal instru-
ment such as a treaty. This defect in consent involves the total or
partial nullity of the instrument in question. In the present case,
it is only Article go of the Descriptive Minute, which allots the plots
to Baerle-Duc, that would be affected by the decision of a judicial
body. The other provisions of the Convention of Maastricht, which
reflect the intention of the Parties, would be unaffected. And, so as
to conform with this decision, it would be for the Parties to regulate
their new legal situation according to the principles of international
law—as they had shown the will to do on the occasion of the abor-
tive Treaty of 1892.

I conclude by giving my opinion—as the Court is requested to—
that the plots in question belong to the sovereignty of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands.
