1. 1 have voted against operative paragraph 1 C of the Judgment
(para. 155) as | am totally unable to endorse the conclusions that, on the
one hand, “Czechoslovakia was entitled to proceed, in November 1991,
to the ‘provisional solution” and, on the other hand, that “Czechoslo-
vakia was not entitled to put into operation, from October 1992, this
‘provisional solution’ and I cannot subscribe to the reasons given in the
Judgment in support of those conclusions.

I am in agreement with the conclusions that the Court has reached on
the other points of the operative paragraph of the Judgment. However,
even with regard to some of the points which I support, my reasoning
differs from that given in the Judgment. I would like to indicate several
points on which I differ from the Judgment through a brief presentation
of my overall views concerning the present case.

10. (Violation of the 1977 Treaty.) Whatever the situation was in 1989
regarding the works to be carried out by Hungary, and in the light of the
fact that the failure to complete the Dunakiliti dam and the auxiliary
structures (the sole purpose of which was to divert water into the bypass
canal) would have made it impossible to operate the whole Gabcikovo-
Nagymaros System of Locks as “a single and indivisible operational sys-
tem of works” (1977 Treaty, Art. 1, para. 1), Hungary should have been
seen to have incurred international responsibility for its failure to carry
out the relevant works, thus being in breach of the 1977 Treaty. It is to be
noted that, at that stage, Hungary did not raise the matter of the termina-
tion of the 1977 Treaty but simply suspended or abandoned the works
for which it was responsible.

Hungary violated the 1977 Treaty. The question remains, however,
whether Hungary was justified in violating its treaty obligations. I fully
share the view of the Court when it concludes that



“Hungary was not entitled to suspend and subsequently abandon, in
1989, the works on the Nagymaros Project and on the part of the
Gabëikovo Project for which the [1977] Treaty . . . attributed respon-
sibility to it” (Judgment, operative paragraph 155, point 1 A)

and that Hungary's wrongful act could not have been justified in any
way.

Let me examine the situation in more detail. Hungary relies, in connec-
tion with the Dunakiliti dam and the diversion of waters into the bypass
canal at Dunakiliti, upon the deterioration of the environment in the
Szigetkôz region owing to the reduced quantity of available water in the
old Danube river bed. In my view, however, the decrease in the amount
of water flowing into the old bed of the Danube as a result of the opera-
tion of the bypass canal would have been an inevitable outcome of the
whole Project as provided for in the 1977 Treaty.

11. (Hungary's ill-founded claim of ecological necessity.) Certain
effects upon the environment of the Szigetkëz region were clearly antici-
pated by and known to Hungary at the initial stage of the planning of the
whole Project. Furthermore, there was no reason for Hungary to believe
that an environmental assessment made in the 1980s would give quite dif-
ferent results from those obtained in 1977, and require the total aban-
donment of the whole Project.

I have no doubt that the Gabtikovo-Nagymaros System of Locks was,
in the 1970s, prepared and designed with full consideration of its poten-
tial impact on the environment of the region, as clearly indicated by the
fact that the 1977 Treaty itself incorporated this concept as its Article 19
(entitled Protection of Nature), and I cannot believe that this assessment
made in the 1970s would have been significantly different from an eco-
logical assessment 10 years later, in other words, in the late 1980s. It is a
fact that the ecological assessment made in the 1980s did not convince
scientists in Czechoslovakia.

[ particularly endorse the view taken by the Court when rejecting the
argument of Hungary, that ecological necessity cannot be deemed to jus-
tify its failure to complete the construction of the Nagymaros dam, and that
Hungary cannot show adequate grounds for that failure by claiming that
the Nagymaros dam would have adversely affected the downstream water
which is drawn to the bank-filtered wells constructed on Szentendre
Island and used as drinking water for Budapest (Judgment, para. 40).

of the importance of the protection of water quality, maintenance of the
bed of the Danube and the protection of nature (Arts. 15, 16, 19), and the
whole structure of the Gabtikovo-Nagymaros System of Locks was cer-
tainly founded on an awareness of the importance of environmental pro-
tection. It cannot be said that the drafters of either the Treaty itself or of



the JCP failed to take due account of the environment. There were, in
addition, no particular circumstances in 1989 that required any of the
research or studies which Hungary claimed to be necessary, and which
would have required several years to be implemented. If no campaign
had been launched by environmentalist groups, then it is my firm convic-
tion that the Project would have gone ahead as planned.

to decide

“whether [Czechoslovakia] was entitled to proceed, in November
1991, to the ‘provisional solution” and to put into operation
from October 1992 this system” (Art. 2, para. | (h)).

work on part of the Gabéikovo Project, more particularly the work at
Dunakiliti, thus preventing the diversion of the water into the bypass
canal, the finalization of the whole Project, which was already nearly
70 per cent complete, was rendered impossible.

In order to accomplish the purpose of the 1977 Treaty, Czechoslo-
vakia, one of the parties to that Treaty, was forced to start work on the
diversion of the waters into a bypass canal that lay within its own terri-
tory. That was the commencement of the so-called “provisional solution”
— in other words, Variant C — in November 1991. Czechoslovakia had
previously made it clear to Hungary that, if Hungary were to abandon
unilaterally the works at Dunakiliti (which constituted the basis of the
whole Project between the two States), it would have to consider an alter-
native plan to accomplish the agreed original Project. Variant C was
designed by Czechoslovakia because it had no other option in order to
give life to the whole Project.

Since the agreed basic concept of the whole Project under the 1977



Treaty had been jeopardized by Hungary, and since the benefit which
Czechoslovakia would have enjoyed as a result of the power plant at
Gabtikovo and all the benefits which would have been available to both
States with regard to international navigation as well as water manage-
ment (including flood prevention) of the river Danube had thereby been
threatened, it was permissible and not unlawful for Czechoslovakia to
start work on Variant C (the construction of the Cunovo dam). This
would have an effect similar to the original plan contemplated in the 1977
Treaty, that is, the diversion of water into the bypass canal. Hungary, for
its part, had from the outset given its full agreement to the diversion of
the Danube waters into a bypass canal at Dunakiliti on its own territory.

23. (The lawfulness of the construction and operation of Variant C.)
The Court has found that “Czechoslovakia was entitled to proceed,
in November 1991, to the ‘provisional solution’” (Judgment, para. 155,

I would like to repeat that I cannot agree with the Judgment when
it states, as I pointed out in paragraph 1 above, that “Czechoslovakia
was entitled to proceed . . . to the "provisional solution’” but it “was not
entitled to put into operation . . . this ‘provisional solution’” (see also
Judgment, para. 79). 1 wonder if the Court is really of the view that
construction work on a project is permissible if the project ultimately,
however, may never be used? The plan to divert the waters of the
Danube river into the bypass canal where the Gabéikovo power plant
was to be constructed was the essence of the whole Project with which
Hungary was in full agreement.

The Judgment states that the diverting of the Danube waters into the
bypass canal was not proportionate to the injury suffered by Czechoslo-
vakia as a result of Hungary’s wrongful act (Judgment, para. 85). How-
ever, I hold the firm view that since Hungary did nothing to divert the
waters at Dunakiliti, thus failing to execute its Treaty obligations, Czecho-
slovakia inevitably had to proceed with Variant C, that is, the construc-
tion of the Cunovo dam and the diversion of the waters of the Danube at
that point, in execution of the JCP, although this was not explicitly
authorized in the 1977 Treaty. This would have been a good reason to



revise the JCP in order to implement the 1977 Treaty, although the con-

(Special Agreement, Art. 2, para. 1 (c); Art. 2, para. 2)

1. Special Agreement, Article 2, Paragraph ! (c)

27. The Court is requested under the terms of the Special Agreement
to decide “what are the legal effects of the notification, on 19 May 1992,
of the termination of the Treaty by [Hungary]” (Art. 2, para. 1 (c)).

28. (Hungary's notification of termination of the 1977 Treaty.) This
question concerns nothing other than the interpretation of the law of
treaties, as the Judgment properly suggests. The termination of the 1977
Treaty is essentially different from an amendment of the JCP. Hungary
claims that, as Variant C was in contradiction of the Plan and thus con-
stituted a wrongful act, the 1977 Treaty could be terminated because of
that alleged violation of the Treaty by Czechoslovakia.

I am in agreement with the Judgment when it states that the termina-
tion of the 1977 Treaty by Hungary does not meet any of the criteria for
the termination of a treaty as set out in the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, which is considered as having the status of customary
international law. I share the view of the Court that the 1977 Treaty has



remained in force, as the notification of termination made by Hungary in
1992 could not have any legal effect (Judgment, para. 155, point 1D).

V. THE FINAL SETTLEMENT
(Special Agreement, Article 5)

30. Hungary and Slovakia have agreed under Article 5 of the Special
Agreement, that: “Immediately after the transmission of the Judgment
the Parties shall enter into negotiations on the modalities for its execu-
tion.”

31. (Negotiations under Article 5 of the Special Agreement.) As | have
already said, my views differ from those set out in the Judgment in that
I believe that Czechoslovakia was entitled to proceed to the provisional
solution, namely, not only the construction of the Cunovo dam but also
the operation of that dam at Cunovo in November 1992 for diversion of
water into the bypass canal. As I see it, Czechoslovakia did not violate
the 1977 Treaty. It is my opinion that the “negotiations” between Hun-
gary and Slovakia under Article 5 of the Special Agreement should be
based on this understanding and not on the finding stated in the Judg-
ment in its operative paragraph 155, points 1 C and 2D.

32. (The amendment of the Joint Contractual Plan.) The implementa-
tion by Czechoslovakia of Variant C — the construction of the Cunovo
dam and the damming of the waters for diversion into the bypass canal
— was a means of executing the plan for the Gabéikovo-Nagymaros Sys-
tem of Locks which had originally been agreed by the Parties. The imple-
mentation of Variant C will not remain a “provisional” solution but will,
in future, form a part of the JCP,

The mode of operation at the Gabéikovo power plant should be
expressly defined in the amended JCP so as to avoid the need for opera-
tion in peak mode, as this has already been voluntarily abandoned by the
Parties and does not need to be considered here.

The way in which the waters are divided at Cunovo should be negoti-
ated in order to maintain the original plan, that is, an equitable share of
the waters — and this should be spelt out in any revision or amendment
of the JCP. The equitable sharing of the water must both meet Hungary's
concern for the environment in the Szigetkô6z region and allow satisfac-
tory operation of the Gabtikovo power plant by Slovakia, as well as the



maintenance of the bypass canal for flood prevention and the improve-
ment of navigation facilities. I would suggest that the JCP should be
revised or some new version drafted during the negotiations under
Article 5 of the Special Agreement in order to comply with the moda-
lities which I have set out above.

33. (Reassessment of the environmental effect). Whilst the whole
Project of the Gab¢ikovo-Nagymaros System of Locks is now in opera-
tion, in its modified form (that is, with the Cunovo dam instead of the
Dunakiliti dam diverting the water to the bypass canal and with the
abandonment of the work on the Nagymaros dam/power plant),
the Parties are under an obligation in their mutual relations, under
Articles 15, 16 and 19 of the 1977 Treaty, and, perhaps in relations
with third parties, under an obligation in general law concerning environ-
mental protection, to preserve the environment in the region of the river
Danube.

The Parties should continue the environmental assessment of the whole
region and search out remedies of a technical nature that could prevent
the environmental damage which might be caused by the new Project.

34. ( Reparation.) The issues on which the Parties should negotiate in
accordance with Article 5 of the Special Agreement are only related to
the details of the reparation to be made by Hungary to Slovakia on
account of its having breached the 1977 Treaty and its failure to execute
the Gabéikovo Project and the Nagymaros Project. The legal conse-
quences of these treaty violations are different in nature, depending on
whether they relate to one or other separate part of the original Project.
Hungary incurred responsibility to Czechoslovakia (later, Slovakia) on
account of its suspension of the Gabèikovo Project and for the work car-
ried out solely by Czechoslovakia to construct the Cunovo dam. In addi-
tion, Czechoslovakia is entitled to claim from Hungary the costs which it
incurred during the construction of the Dunakiliti dam, which subse-
quently became redundant (see paras. 17 and 18 above).

With regard to the abandonment by Hungary of the Nagymaros dam,
Hungary is not, in principle, required to pay any reparation to Slovakia
as its action did not affect any essential interest of Slovakia (see para. 19
above). There is one point which should not be overlooked, that is, as the
Nagymaros dam and power plant are, as Slovakia admits, no longer a
part of the whole Project, the construction of the bypass canal from
Cunovo would be mostly for the benefit of Slovakia and would provide
no benefit to Hungary.

The main benefits of the whole Project now accrue to Slovakia, with
the exception of the flood prevention measures and the improved facili-
ties for international navigation, which are enjoyed by both States. This
should be taken into account when assessing the reparation to be paid as
a whole by Hungary to Slovakia.



In view of the statements | have made above, it is my firm belief that
