                       Admissibility — Integrity of the judicial function of the Court — Abuse of
                     process — Abuse of rights.

                        1. The Court today concludes that it has jurisdiction on the basis of
                     the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
                     (the “Optional Protocol”) in respect of the Applicant’s claim that the
                     building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris (the “Building”) qualifies as premises
                     of the mission entitled to the treatment required by Article 22 of the
                     Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (the “Vienna Convention”).
                     I agree. However, I have voted against subparagraphs (3) and (4) of para-
                     graph 154 because I consider that this claim is inadmissible and that the
                     Application should have been dismissed.
                        2. In its third preliminary objection (which the Court properly charac-
                     terizes as an objection to admissibility), France calls for dismissal of the
                     entire Application on the ground of its “abusive nature”. Because the
                     Court has concluded that it lacks jurisdiction pursuant to the
                     United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, I
                     address here only the admissibility of the Applicant’s claim in relation to
                     the Vienna Convention. I take no position here on the merits of that
                     claim, nor do I express any view on whether Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obi-
                     ang Mangue is guilty of the crimes with which he has been charged in
                     France, a matter that is not for this Court to decide.
                        3. France refers both to “abuse of process” and “abuse of rights” in
                     support of its third preliminary objection. These notions may have estab-
                     lished meanings in certain national legal systems. However, I am not
                     aware of any authoritative definition of either term in the context of inter-
                     national adjudication. The Court offers its views of the scope of these
                     terms today.
                        4. The Court finds that the Application is “not inadmissible on grounds
                     of abuse of process or abuse of rights” (Judgment, para. 153). The Judgment
                     treats “abuse of process” and “abuse of rights” as two separate notions.
                        According to the Court, an abuse of process “goes to the procedure
                     before a court or tribunal and can be considered at the preliminary phase”
                     of proceedings. The Judgment states that an application can be found
                     inadmissible on the basis of “abuse of process” only when there is “clear
                     evidence” and only in “exceptional circumstances” (ibid., para. 150).
                     It does not find the Application to present such exceptional circum-
                     stances.
                        The Court considers that the “abuse of rights cannot be invoked as a
                     ground of inadmissibility when the establishment of the right in question

                        5. By defining “abuse of process” and “abuse of rights” narrowly and
                     by isolating each of these concepts from the other, I believe that the Court
                     has overlooked the core of France’s third preliminary objection:

                              “it is not the individual elements which France has brought to this
                              Court’s attention, considered in isolation, that constitute an abuse of
                              process. Taken as a whole, however, they establish that Equato-
                              rial Guinea’s Application to the Court is abusive, since it in fact forms
                              part of a strategy to use the principle of diplomatic immunities as a
                              contrivance for the benefit of an individual who is not a diplomat,
                              and thereby to obstruct the criminal proceedings initiated against him
                              in France and avoid the potential confiscation of the personal prop-
                              erty he has acquired there.

                              France requests you to find that, by seising the Court, Equato-
                              rial Guinea has committed an abuse of process, the purpose of which
                              is to have the Court provide cover for the applicant State’s improper
                              and abusive use of the law of diplomatic immunities.” (CR 2018/2,
                              pp. 53‑54, paras. 21 and 24 (Pellet) 1.)
                        6. The Respondent refers to a “contrivance” by the Applicant that is
                     part of a “strategy” that culminates in the seising of the Court. The
                     Respondent’s allegations raise this question: is the conduct in which the
                     Applicant engaged as a predicate for the assertion of certain rights of
                     such a character that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction to
                     determine whether the Applicant has those rights? This is a question of
                     admissibility. Its answer does not call for a decision as to whether the
                     rights asserted by Equatorial Guinea have been established (a matter for
                     the merits).

                       7. Some questions of admissibility arise only when they are raised by a
                     party. Other aspects of admissibility touch on the fundamental role and
                     function of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations:

                             “There are inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial func-
                          tion which the Court, as a court of justice, can never ignore. There
                          may thus be an incompatibility between the desires of an applicant,
                          or, indeed, of both the parties to a case, on the one hand, and on the
                          other hand the duty of the Court to maintain its judicial character.
                          The Court itself, and not the parties, must be the guardian of the
                          Court’s judicial integrity.” (Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. United
                          Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963,
                          p. 29.)
                        8. The allegations by France raise questions about whether the Court
                     can consider the Application without compromising its judicial integrity.
                     The Respondent’s harsh words could perhaps be discounted as the hyper-
                     bole of oral advocacy, but the facts before the Court cannot be so easily
                     set aside. The evidence that bears on the question of the admissibility (as
                     framed in paragraph 6 above) is before the Court at this stage of the pro-
                     ceedings and is not in dispute. The relevant facts are evident on the face
                     of documents submitted to the Court by the Applicant, including state-
                     ments by representatives of the applicant State. I summarize those facts
                     here.

                     the Building, a valuable property in French territory. Since Decem-
                     ber 2010, he has been facing prosecution in France for money laundering
                     (a means of shielding assets from law enforcement authorities). There­
                     after, beginning in 2011, the applicant State has co-­operated with Mr. Teo-
                     doro Nguema Obiang Mangue in a series of actions with respect to the
                     Building. It has made a variety of assertions to French authorities about
                     the use of the Building, on the basis of which it has invoked immunity
                     and inviolability. If the steps taken by the Applicant are given effect, real
                     property in France’s territory that had been in the hands of an individual
                     facing prosecution will be shielded from French authorities as inviolable
                     mission premises that are “immune from search, requisition, attachment
                     or execution” under Article 22 of the Vienna Convention. The sum of
                     €34 million that was paid in exchange for that property is also beyond
                     the reach of French law enforcement authorities, having been transferred
                     to a bank account in Equatorial Guinea.

                        15. The President of Equatorial Guinea made clear that the purpose of
                     these actions is a personal one, to address difficulties faced by his son.
                     Such a purpose is entirely at odds with the régime of privileges and immu-
                     nities contained in the Vienna Convention, which states in its preamble
                     that the purpose of privileges and immunities “is not to benefit individu-
                     als but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic
                     missions as representing States”.
                        16. During the hearing on provisional measures, France stated that
                     “the judicial police officers who conducted the searches of the building in
                     2012 found no official documents belonging to Equatorial Guinea or to
                     its diplomatic mission in France” (CR 2016/15, p. 29, para. 25 (Pellet)) 1.
                     Equatorial Guinea has not refuted this statement, nor has it indicated to
                     the Court that embassy archives or other government documents were
                     among the possessions attached or taken into possession by French
                     authorities in their searches of the Building.

                        17. As the Court has observed, “there is no more fundamental prereq-
                     uisite for the conduct of relations between States than the inviolability of
                     diplomatic envoys and embassies” (United States Diplomatic and Con-
                     sular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran), Provisional Mea-
                     sures, Order of 15 December 1979, I.C.J. Reports 1979, p. 19, para. 38).
                     Despite their importance to the functioning of diplomacy, the immunity
                     and inviolability of diplomatic personnel and missions exist in uneasy ten-
                     sion with other interests of States and private parties. Every day, foreign
                     ministry lawyers are in dialogue with counterparts in other capitals
                     regarding the application of the Vienna Convention to particular cases.
                     Differences inevitably emerge. The parties to the Optional Protocol have
                     recognized that the Court is a suitable forum for addressing these differ-

                     ences. If the Court declines to decide a dispute arising under the Vienna
                     Convention, despite having jurisdiction to do so, there will be no judicial
                     resolution of the merits, an outcome that may be unsatisfactory to both
                     Parties. It is only in “exceptional circumstances” — to echo the words
                     used by the Court today — that the Court should refuse to exercise its
                     jurisdiction over such a dispute.

                        18. The present case is such an exceptional circumstance. The sequence
                     of actions taken by the applicant State is established by the documents
                     submitted by the Applicant. The purpose of those actions, which was
                     stated by the President of the applicant State, is manifest. The evidence
                     regarding the character of the Applicant’s conduct is conclusive, easily
                     meeting the heightened standards of proof that the Court has suggested
                     in certain circumstances (e.g. “clear and convincing evidence” (Applica-
                     tion of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav
                     Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (II),
                     p. 685, para. 132, quoting Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question
                     (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol. II, p. 930)). The applicant State has told
                     the Court nothing to suggest that its diplomatic functions were disrupted
                     when French authorities entered the Building and initiated searches in
                     September 2011, nor is there any indication that French authorities
                     entered or attached the Building with such a purpose. The dismissal of
                     this Application would pose no threat to diplomatic functions. On the
                     other hand, the Court’s decision today means that the applicant State will
                     continue to benefit from the Court’s Order on provisional measures of
                     7 December 2016 until the Court’s Judgment on the merits.

                       19. Despite conclusive evidence of the character of the conduct in
                     which the Applicant engaged as a predicate for its assertion of rights in
                     this Court, the Court allows the case to proceed to the merits, as if this is
                     yet another disagreement about the nuances of the régime of diplomatic
                     immunity. To preserve the integrity of its judicial function, I believe that
                     the Court should not have allowed itself to be used to further this effort
                     by the Applicant. It should instead have upheld the third preliminary
                     objection. Accordingly, I dissent.
