                     ing various changes in minke whales. In particular, Japan emphasizes
                     multi‑species competition and ecosystem research as explanations for the
                     minke whale sample size of 850, as well as for including fin and hump-
                     back whales in the programme. JARPA II was designed with a six‑year
                     “research phase” after which a review will be held and revisions may be
                     made. It is difficult to see how there could be a meaningful review of
                     JARPA II in respect of these two critical objectives after six years if the
                     research period for two of three species is 12 years.



                       178. Thus, the selection of a 12‑year research period for fin whales and
                     humpback whales is one factor that casts doubt on the centrality of the

                        179. Another factor casts doubt on whether the design of JARPA II is
                     reasonable in relation to achieving the programme’s stated objectives.
                     The overall sample sizes selected for fin and humpback whales —
                     50 whales of each species per year — are not large enough to allow for the
                     measurement of all the trends that the programme seeks to measure. Spe-
                     cifically, the JARPA II Research Plan states that at least 131 whales of
                     each species should be taken annually to detect a particular rate of change
                     in age at sexual maturity. The Research Plan does not indicate whether
                     the researchers decided to accept a lower level of accuracy or instead
                     adjusted the rate of change that they sought to detect by targeting fewer
                     whales, nor did Japan explain this in the present proceedings. In light of
                     the calculations of its own scientists, JARPA II does not appear designed
                     to produce statistically relevant information on at least one central
                     research item to which the JARPA II Research Plan gives particular
                     importance.

                        180. The Court also notes that the expert called by Japan, Mr. Walløe,
                     raised concerns about the fin whale component of JARPA II that go
                     beyond the sample size. Mr. Walløe testified that the fin whale proposal
                     was “not very well conceived” for two reasons. He stated that random
                     sampling of fin whales within the JARPA II research area is not possible,
                     first, because the main fin whale population is beyond the JARPA II
                     research area — further to the north — and, secondly, because the
                     JARPA II vessels can only accommodate the lethal take of smaller fin
                     whales (a point also raised by Australia). The Court recalls that Japan
                     identified random sampling as an element of a programme for purposes
                     of scientific research.
                        181. The Court finds that the JARPA II Research Plan overall pro-
                     vides only limited information regarding the basis for the decisions used
                     to calculate the fin and humpback whale sample size. These sample sizes
                     were set using a 12‑year period, despite the fact that a shorter six‑year
                     period is used to set the minke whale sample size and that JARPA II is to
                     be reviewed after each six‑year research phase. Based on Japan’s own cal-
                     culations, the sample sizes for fin and humpback whales are too small to
                     produce statistically useful results. These shortcomings, in addition to the
                     problems specific to the decision to take fin whales, as noted in the pre-
                     ceding paragraph, are important to the Court’s assessment of whether the
                     overall design of JARPA II is reasonable in relation to the programme’s
                     objectives, because Japan connects the minke whale sample size (dis-
                     cussed below) to the ecosystem research and multi‑species competition
                     objectives that, in turn, are premised on the lethal sampling of fin and
                     humpback whales.

                        182. The Court turns next to the design of the sample size for Antarc-
                     tic minke whales in JARPA II. The JARPA II Research Plan indicates
                     that the overall sample size for minke whales was chosen following
                     Japan’s calculation of the minimum sample size for a number of different
                     research items, including age at sexual maturity, apparent pregnancy rate,
                     blubber thickness, contaminant levels, mixing patterns between different
                     stocks and population trends. The plan further states that for most
                     parameters “the sample sizes calculated were in a range of 800‑1,000 ani-
                     mals with more than 800 being desirable”. Japan describes the process
                     that it ­followed to determine the overall sample size for minke whales
                     with ­reference to the following illustration that appears as Figure 5‑4 in
                     its Counter‑Memorial :

                        183. As depicted in this illustration, the overall sample size falls within
                     a range that corresponds to what the JARPA II Research Plan sets forth
                     as the minimum requirements for most of the research that JARPA II is
                     designed to undertake. Japan asserts that for this reason, the overall

                     annual lethal sample size was set at 850 (plus or minus 10 per cent, which
                     allows for a maximum of 935 minke whales per year). As noted above
                     (see paragraphs 159 and 169), Japan considered this number of whales to
                     be sufficient for purposes of research, taking into account the need to
                     avoid causing harm to the stocks.
                        184. In contrast, in Australia’s view, Japan started with the goal of
                     establishing a sample size of approximately 850 minke whales per year
                     and then “retro‑fitted” the programme’s design by selecting values
                     designed to generate sample sizes for particular research items that cor-
                     responded to Japan’s desired overall sample size. Australia emphasizes
                     that the JARPA II Research Plan is not clear in stating the reasons for
                     the selection of the particular sample size appertaining to each research
                     item. Australia also notes that different choices as to values for certain
                     variables would have led to dramatically smaller sample sizes, but that, in
                     general, the JARPA II Research Plan provides no explanation for the
                     underlying decisions to use values that generate larger sample sizes. These
                     shortcomings, in Australia’s view, support its conclusion that the minke
                     whale sample size was set not for purposes of scientific research, but
                     instead to meet Japan’s funding requirements and commercial objectives.

                        185. In light of these divergent views, the Court will consider the evi-
                     dence regarding Japan’s selection of the various minimum sample sizes
                     that it chose for different individual research items, which form the basis
                     for the overall sample size for minke whales. As noted above (see para-
                     graph 172), the purpose of such an inquiry is not to second‑guess the
                     scientific judgments made by individual scientists or by Japan, but rather
                     to examine whether Japan, in light of JARPA II’s stated research objec-
                     tives, has demonstrated a reasonable basis for annual sample sizes per-
                     taining to particular research items, leading to the overall sample size
                     of 850 (plus or minus 10 per cent) for minke whales.


                         186. In the JARPA II Research Plan, individual sample size calcula-
                     tions are presented with respect to each of the items referred to in the
                     above illustration : age at sexual maturity, apparent pregnancy rate,
                     ­blubber thickness, pathological monitoring (i.e., monitoring of contami-
                      nant levels), mixing patterns between different stocks, and “DNA
                      mark‑recapture”, which Japan describes as a method for researching
                      ­population trends.

                        187. The Court notes at the outset that the JARPA II Research Plan
                     states that for all parameters, “a sample size needed to detect changes in
                     a six‑year period . . . has been adopted as the pertinent criterion”. The
                     JARPA II Research Plan does not explain the reason for this threshold
                     decision, but Japan offered some explanations during these proceedings,
                     which are discussed below (see paragraph 192).






8 CIJ1062.indb 248                                                                                 18/05/15 09:29

                        188. The evidence shows that the JARPA II Research Plan lacks trans-
                     parency in the reasons for selecting particular sample sizes for individual
                     research items. This is a matter on which the experts called by the two
                     Parties agreed, as described above (see paragraphs 158‑159). With the
                     exception of one variable (discussed in the next paragraph), the JARPA II
                     Research Plan provides very limited information regarding the selection
                     of a particular value for a given variable. For example, in the Court’s
                     view, there is no consistent effort to explain why, for the various research
                     items relating to the monitoring of biological parameters, JARPA II is
                     designed to detect one particular rate or degree of change over another
                     that would result in a lower sample size. These shortcomings of the
                     JARPA II Research Plan have particular prominence in light of the fact
                     that the particular choices of rate and degree of change consistently lead
                     to a sample size of approximately 850 minke whales per year.


                        189. An exception to this pattern is arguably the discussion of the sam-
                     ple size applicable to the study of the age at sexual maturity of minke
                     whales, as to which the JARPA II Research Plan furnishes some details
                     about the factors that Japan considered in selecting the particular rate of
                     change to detect. For this research item, the Research Plan also offers an
                     indication of the relationship between the data sought and the first two
                     JARPA II research objectives. The Court finds no comparable reasoning
                     given as to the five other research items that were expressly used to set the
                     overall sample size of 850 whales (i.e., those research items set forth in
                     Figure 5‑4 from Japan’s Counter‑Memorial above). This highlights the
                     absence of evidence, at least in the JARPA II Research Plan, that could
                     support a finding that the sample size for the lethal take of minke whales,
                     a key component of the design of JARPA II, is reasonable in relation to
                     achieving the programme’s objectives.
                        190. The Court also recalls that one of the experts called by Australia,
                     Mr. Mangel, asserted that nearly the same level of accuracy that JARPA II
                     seeks could be obtained with a smaller lethal take of minke whales and
                     further posited that a smaller take and higher margin of error might be
                     acceptable, depending on the hypothesis under study. Japan did not
                     refute this expert opinion.

                        191. The Court turns next to the evidence regarding Japan’s decision
                     to use a six‑year period to calculate the sample sizes for research items
                     corresponding to minke whales, rather than a 12‑year period as was used
                     for fin and humpback whales. That decision has a considerable effect on
                     sample size because the shorter time‑period generally requires a higher
                     figure, as the JARPA II Research Plan demonstrates (see paragraph 165
                     above).

                       192. Japan, in discussing one research item (age at sexual maturity) in
                     the Counter‑Memorial, attributes the use of a six‑year period to the need





8 CIJ1062.indb 250                                                                                   18/05/15 09:29

                     284 	           whaling in the antarctic (judgment)

                     to obtain at least three data points from each JARPA II research area
                     (since whales are taken from each area in alternating seasons), because it
                     would be “highly uncertain” to detect a trend on the basis of only two
                     data points. Japan also refers to the desirability of detecting change “as
                     promptly as possible”. In the oral proceedings, Japan offered two differ-
                     ent rationales for the six‑year period. After initially suggesting that the
                     six‑year period was intended to coincide with JARPA II’s six‑year review
                     by the Scientific Committee, Japan withdrew that explanation and
                     asserted that the six‑year period for minke whales was chosen because it
                     “coincides with the review period for the RMP”. This corresponds to the
                     explanation given by the expert called by Japan, Mr. Walløe, in his oral

                     achieving the programme’s objectives. However, the Court finds it
                     ­problematic that, first, the JARPA II Research Plan does not explain the
                      reason for choosing a six‑year period for one of the whale species
                      (minke whales) and, secondly, Japan did not offer a consistent explana-
                      tion during these proceedings for the decision to use that research period
                      to calculate the minke whale sample size.

                        194. Moreover, Japan does not address how disparate research time
                     frames for the three whale species are compatible with JARPA II’s
                     research objectives relating to ecosystem modelling and multi‑species
                     competition. JARPA II is apparently designed so that statistically useful
                     information regarding fin and humpback whales will only be available
                     after 12 years of research (and the evidence indicates that, even after
