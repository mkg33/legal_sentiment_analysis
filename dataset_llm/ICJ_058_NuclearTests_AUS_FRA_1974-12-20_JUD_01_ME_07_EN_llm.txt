1. In its Judgment the Court decides, ex proprio motu, that the claim
of the Applicant no longer has any object. We respectfully, but vigor-
ously dissent. In registering the reasons for our dissent we propose first
to make a number of observations designed to explain why, in our view,
it is not justifiable to say that the claim of the Applicant no longer has
any object. We shall then take up the issues of jurisdiction and admissi-
bility which are not examined in the Judgment but which appear to us to
be of cardinal importance to the Court’s treatment of the matters decided
in the Judgment. It is also to these two issues, not touched in the Judg-
ment, to which the Applicant was specifically directed to address itself
in the Court’s Order of 22 June 1973.

2. Basically, the Judgment is grounded on the premise that the sole
object of the claim of Australia is “to obtain a termination of” the
“atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by France in the South Pacific
region” (para. 30). It further assumes that, although the judgment which
the Applicant seeks would have been rested on a finding that “further
tests would not be consistent with international law, such finding would
be only a means to an end, and not an end in itself” (ibid. ).

3. In our view the basic premise of the Judgment, which limits the Ap-
plicant’s submissions to a single purpose, and narrowly circumscribes its
objective in pursuing the present proceedings, is untenable. In conse-
quence the Court’s chain of reasoning leads to an erroneous conclusion.
This occurs, we think, partly because the Judgment fails to take account
of the purpose and utility of a request for a declaratory judgment and
even more because its basic premise fails to correspond to and even
changes the nature and scope of Australia’s formal submissions as
presented in the Application.

4. In the Application Australia:

“... Asks the Court to adjudge and declare that, for the above-
mentioned reasons or any of them or for any other reason that
the Court deems to be relevant, the carrying out of further at-
mospheric nuclear weapon tests in the South Pacific Ocean is not
consistent with applicable rules of international law.



and to Order
that the French Republic shall not carry out any further such tests.”

6. In paragraph 19 of the Application it is stated that:

“The Australian Government will seek a declaration that the
holding of further atmospheric tests by the French Government in
the Pacific Ocean is not in accordance with international law and
involves an infringement of the rights of Australia. The Australian
Government will also request that, unless the French Government
should give the Court an undertaking that the French Government
will treat a declaration by the Court in the sense just stated as a
sufficient ground for discontinuing further atmospheric testing, the
Court should make an order calling upon the French Republic to
refrain from any further atmospheric tests.” (Emphasis added.)

Consequently, it can hardly be said, as is done in paragraph 30 of
the Judgment, that the declaration of illegality of atmospheric tests asked
for in the first part of the Applicant’s formal submission is merely a
means for obtaining a Court Order for the cessation of further tests. On
the contrary, the declaration of illegality is the basic claim submitted by
Australia to the Court; and this request is indeed described in the
Memorial (para. 430) as the “main prayer in the Application”.

7. The Applicant asks for a judicial declaration to the effect that
atmospheric nuclear tests are ‘‘not consistent . . . with international law”.
This bare assertion cannot be described as constituting merely a reason
advanced in support of the Order. The legal reasons invoked by the
Applicant both in support of the declaration and the Order relate inter
alia to the alleged violation by France of certain rules said to be generally



accepted as customary law concerning atmospheric nuclear tests; and its
alleged infringement of rights said to be inherent in the Applicant’s own
territorial sovereignty and of rights derived from the character of the high
seas as res communis. These reasons, designed to support the sub-
missions, are clearly distinguished in the pleadings from the decisions
which the Court is asked to make. According to the terms of the sub-
mission the Court is requested to make the declaration of illegality “for
the above-mentioned reasons or any of them or for any other reason
that the Court deems to be relevant”. Isolated from those reasons or
legal propositions, the declaration that atmospheric nuclear tests are
“not consistent with applicable rules of international law” is the precise
formulation of something that the Applicant is formally asking the Court
to decide in the operative part of the Judgment. While “it is no part of the
judicial function of the Court to declare in the operative part of its Judg-
ment that any of those arguments is or is not well founded 1°, to decide and
declare that certain conduct of a State is or is not consistent with inter-
national law is of the essence of international adjudication, the heart of
the Court’s judicial function.

8. The Judgment asserts in paragraph 30 that “the original and ulti-
mate objective of the Applicant was and has remained to obtain a ter-
mination of those tests; thus its claim cannot be regarded as being a
claim for a declaratory judgment”. In our view the premise in no way
leads to the conclusion. In international litigation a request for a de-
claratory judgment is normally sufficient even when the Applicant’s
ultimate objective is to obtain the termination of certain conduct of the
Respondent which it considers to be illegal. As Judge Hudson said in his
individual opinion in the Diversion of Water from the Meuse case:

“In international jurisprudence, however, sanctions are of a
different nature and they play a different role, with the result that a
declaratory judgment will frequently have the same compulsive
force as a mandatory judgment; States are disposed to respect the
one not less than the other.” (P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 70, p. 79.)

And, as Charles De Visscher has stated :

“The essential task of the Court, as emerges both from the sub-
missions of the parties and from the operative parts of its judgments,
normally amounts to no more than defining the legal relationships
between the parties, without indicating any specific requirements of
conduct. Broadly speaking, the Court refrains from pronouncing
condemnations and leaves it to the States parties to the case to draw
the conclusions flowing from its decisions 2.” [ Translation. ]

9. A dual submission, like the one presented here, comprising both
a request for a declaration of illegality and a prayer for an order or in-
junction to end certain measures is not infrequent in international liti-
gation.

This type of dual submission, when presented in other cases has been
considered by this Court and its predecessor as containing two inde-
pendent formal submissions, the first or declaratory part being treated as
a true submission, as an end in itself and not merely as part of the reason-
ing or as a means to obtain the cessation of the alleged unlawful activity.
(Diversion of Water from the Meuse, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 70, pp. 5, 6
and 28; Right of Passage over Indian Territory, I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 10
and 31.)

The fact that consequential requests for an Order or an equivalent in-
junction are made, as they were made in the above-mentioned cases, was
not then considered and cannot be accepted as a sufficient reason to
ignore or put aside the Applicant’s primary submission or to dispose of
it as part of the reasoning. Nor is it justified to introduce a conceptual
dichotomy between declaratory and other judgments in order to achieve
the same effect. The fact that the Applicant's submissions are not limited
to a declaration of the legal situation but also ask for some consequential
relief cannot be used to set aside the basic submission in which the de-
claration of the legal situation is asked to be made in the operative part
of the Judgment.

10. In the above-mentioned cases the judges who had occasion to
analyse in detail in their individual opinions the Applicant's submissions
recognized that in these basic submissions the Applicants sought a
declaratory judgment from the Court. The individual opinion of Judge
Hudson in the Diversion of Water from the Meuse case has already been
mentioned. In the Right of Passage over Indian Territory case, Judges
Winiarski and Badawi in their dissenting opinion recognized that: “What
the Portuguese Government is asking of the Court, therefore, is that it
shall deliver in the first place a declaratory judgment.” They added
something which is fully applicable to the present case:

... although this claim is followed by the two others, comple-
mentary and contingent, it constitutes the very essence of the case
. .. The object of the suit, as it follows from the first Portuguese
submission, is to obtain from the Court a recognition and statement
of the situation at law between the Parties” (7.C.J. Reports 1960,
p. 74).

Judge Armand-Ugon in his dissenting opinion also said: “The Court is
asked for a declaratory judgment as to the existence of a right of pas-
sage.” (Ibid, p. 77.) And this approach was not limited to dissenting
opinions. The Court's Judgment in that case states that the Applicant



“invoked its right of passage and asked the Court to declare the existence
of that right” (emphasis added) and also says:

“To this first claim Portugal adds two others, though these are
conditional upon a reply, wholly or partly favourable, to the first
claim, and will lose their purpose if the right alleged is not recog-
nized.” (Ibid., p. 29.)

11. In a case brought to the Court by means of an application the for-
mal submissions of the parties define the subject of the dispute, as is
recognized in paragraph 24 of the Judgment. Those submissions must
therefore be considered as indicating the objectives which are pursued by
an applicant through the judicial proceedings.

While the Court is entitled to interpret the submissions of the parties,
it is not authorized to introduce into them radical alterations. The Per-
manent Court said in this respect: ““... though it can construe the sub-
missions of the Parties, it cannot substitute itself for them and formulate
new submissions simply on the basis of arguments and facts advanced”
(P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 7, p. 35, case concerning Certain German Interests
in Polish Upper Silesia). The Judgment (para. 29) refers to this as a
limitation on the power of the Court to interpret the submissions “when
the claim is not properly formulated because the submissions of the
parties are inadequate”. If, however, the Court lacks the power to refor-
mulate inadequate submissions, a fortiori it cannot reformulate sub-
missions as clear and specific as those in this case.

12. In any event, the cases cited in paragraph 29 of the Judgment to
justify the setting aside in the present instance of the Applicant’s first
submission do not, in our view, provide any warrant for such a summary
disposal of the “main prayer in the Application”. In those cases the sub-
missions held by the Court not to be true submissions were specific
propositions advanced merely to furnish reasons in support of the decision
requested of the Court in the “true” final submission. Thus, in the
Fisheries case the Applicant had summarized in the form of submissions
a whole series of legal propositions, some not even contested, merely as
steps logically leading to its true final submissions (7.C.J. Reports 1951,
at pp. 121-123 and 126). In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case the “true”
final submission was stated first and two legal propositions were then
adduced by way of furnishing alternative grounds on which the Court
might uphold it (7.C.J. Reports 1953, at p. 52); and in the Nottebohm case
a submission regarding the naturalization of Nottebohm in Liechtenstein
was considered by the Court to be merely “a reason advanced for a
decision by the Court in favour of Liechtenstein’ on the “real issue” of
the admissibility of the claim (7.C.J. Reports 1955, at p. 16). In the present
case, as we have indicated, the situation is quite otherwise. The legality or
illegality of the carrying out by France of atmospheric nuclear tests in the
South Pacific Ocean is the basic issue submitted to the Court’s decision,
and it seems to us as wholly unjustifiable to treat the Applicant’s request



for a declaration of illegality merely as reasoning advanced in support of
its request for an Order prohibiting further tests.

13. In accordance with these basic principles, the true nature of the
Australian claim, and of the objectives sought by the Applicant ought to
have been determined on the basis of the clear and natural meaning of the
text of its formal submission. The interpretation of that submission made
by the Court constitutes in our view not an interpretation but a revision
of the text, which ends in eliminating what the Applicant stated is “the
main prayer in the Application”, namely the request for a declaration of
illegality of nuclear atmospheric tests in the South Pacific Ocean. A
radical alteration or mutilation of an applicant’s submission under the
guise of interpretation has serious consequences because it constitutes a
frustration of a party’s legitimate expectations that the case which it has
put before the Court will be examined and decided. In this instance the
serious consequences have an irrevocable character because the Applicant
is now prevented from resubmitting its Application and seising the Court
again by reason of France’s denunciation of the instruments on which
it is sought to base the Court’s jurisdiction in the present dispute.

14. The Judgment revises, we think, the Applicant’s submission by
bringing in other materials such as diplomatic communications and
statements made in the course of the hearings. These materials do not
justify, however, the interpretation arrived at in the Judgment. They
refer to requests made repeatedly by the Applicant for an assurance from
France as to the cessation of tests. But these requests for an assurance
cannot have the effect attributed to them by the Judgment. While liti-
gation is in progress an applicant may address requests to a respondent
to give an assurance that it will not pursue the contested activity, but such
requests cannot by themselves support the inference that an unqualified
assurance, if received, would satisfy all the objectives the applicant is
seeking through the judicial proceedings; still less can they restrict or
amend the claims formally submitted to the Court. According to the
Rules of Court, this can only result from a clear indication by the appli-
cant to that effect, through a withdrawal of the case, a modification of its
submissions or an equivalent action. It is not for nothing that the sub-
missions are required to be presented in writing and bear the signature of
the agent. It is a non sequitur, therefore, to interpret such requests for an
assurance as constituting an implied renunciation, a modification or a
withdrawal of the claim which is still maintained before the Court, asking
for a judicial declaration of illegality of atmospheric tests. At the very
least, since the Judgment attributes intentions and implied waivers to the
Applicant, that Party should have been given an opportunity to explain its
real intentions and objectives, instead of proceeding to such a determi-
nation /naudita parte.

15. The Judgment, while it reiterates that the Applicant’s objective
has been to bring about the termination of atmospheric nuclear tests,
fails to examine a crucial question, namely from what date the Applicant
sought to achieve this objective. To answer this point it is necessary to
take into account the date from which, according to the Australian sub-
mission, the legality of the French atmospheric tests is brought into
question. The term “further atmospheric tests” used in the submission
was also employed in the Australian diplomatic Note of 3 January 1973
addressed to the French Government. In that Note the claim as to the
illegality of the tests and an express request to refrain from them were
raised for the first time. When a State sends a communication asking
another State “to refrain from any further acts’ which are said to be
illegal, it seems obvious that this claim and request refer to all acts which
may take place after the date of the diplomatic communication. Similarly,
when Australia filed its Application it seems evident that its request to
the Court to declare the illegality of “further atmospheric nuclear wea-
pons tests’ must be understood as referring to all tests conducted as from
9 May 1973, the date of the Application.

While an injunction or an Order from the Court on the holding of
“further atmospheric tests’ could have effect only as from the date it is
delivered, a judicial declaration of illegality like the one requested would
embrace not merely subsequent tests but also those which took place in
1973 and 1974 after the Application was filed. That such was the objective
of the Applicant is confirmed by the fact that as soon as the Application
was filed Australia requested interim measures in order to protect its
position with regard to the possible continuation of atmospheric tests by
France after the filing of the Application and before the delivery of the
Court’s Judgment on the merits. A request for a declaration of illegality
covering the atmospheric tests which were conducted in 1973 and 1974, in
disregard of the interim Order of the Court, could not be deprived of its
object by statements of intention limited to tests to be conducted in 1975
or thereafter.

16. Such a view of the matter takes no account of the possibility of
Australia seeking to claim compensation in respect of the 12 tests
conducted in 1973 and 1974. It is true that the Applicant has not asked
for compensation for damage in the proceedings which are now before
the Court. However, the Australian Government has not waived its
right to claim them in the future. It has significantly stated in the Me-
morial (para. 435) that: “At the present time” (emphasis added), it is not
the “intention of the Australian Government to seek pecuniary damages”.
The possibility cannot therefore be excluded that the Applicant may in-
tend to claim damages, at a later date, through the diplomatic channel or
otherwise, in the event of a favourable decision furnishing it with a
declaration of illegality. Such a procedure, which has been followed in
previous cases before international tribunals, would have been particu-



larly understandable in a case involving radio-active fall-out in which the
existence and extent of damage may not readily be ascertained before
some time has elapsed.

17. In one of the instances in which damages have been claimed in a
subsequent Application on the basis of a previous declaratory judgment,
the Permanent Court endorsed this use of the declaratory judgment,
stating that it was designed:

“, . . to ensure recognition of a situation at law, once and for all, and
with binding force as between the Parties; so that the legal position
thus established cannot again be called in question in so far as the
legal effects ensuing therefrom are concerned” (Factory at Chorzôw,
P.C.1J., Series A, No. 13, p. 20).

18. Furthermore, quite apart from any claim to compensation for
damage, a request for a declaration of the illegality of France's atmos-
pheric nuclear weapon tests cannot be said to be without object in rela-
tion to the numerous tests carried out in 1973 and 1974. The declaration,
if obtained, would characterize those tests as a violation of Australia’s
rights under international law. As the Court’s Judgment in the Corfu
Channel case clearly confirms (I.C.J. Reports 1949, at p. 35) such a
declaration is a form of “satisfaction” which the Applicant might have
legitimately demanded when it presented its final submissions in the
present proceedings, independently of any claim to compensation. Indeed,
in that case the Court in the operative part of the Judgment pronounced

such a declaration as constituting ‘““in itself appropriate satisfaction”
(ibid., p. 36).

19, The Judgment implies that there was a dispute between the Parties,
but asserts that such a dispute has now disappeared because “the objec-
tive of the claim has been achieved by other means” (para. 55).

We cannot agree with this finding, which is based on the premise that
the sole purpose of the Application was to obtain a cessation of tests as
from the date of the Judgment. In our view the dispute between the
Parties has not disappeared since it has concerned, from its origin, the
question of the legality of the tests as from the date of the Application.
It is true that from a factual point of view the extent of the dispute is
reduced if no further atmospheric tests are conducted in 1975 and there-
after, but from a legal point of view the question which remains in dis-
pute is whether the atmospheric nuclear tests which were in fact conducted
in 1973 and 1974 were consistent with the rules of international law.

There has been no change in the position of the Parties as to that issue.
Australia continues to ask the Court to declare that atmospheric nuclear



tests are inconsistent with international law and is prepared to argue
and develop that point. France, on its part, as recognized in the Judgment
(para. 51), maintains the view that “its nuclear experiments have not
violated any rule of international law”. In announcing the cessation of the
tests in 1975 the French Government, according to the Judgment, did
not recognize that France was bound by any rule of international law to
terminate its tests (ibid.).

Consequently, the legal dispute between the Parties, far from having
disappeared, still persists. A judgment by the Court on the legality of
nuclear atmospheric tests in the South Pacific region would thus pro-
nounce on a legal question in which the Parties are in conflict as to their
respective rights.

20. We cannot accept the view that the decision of such a dispute
would be a judgment in abstracto, devoid of object or having no raison
d’étre. On the contrary, as has been already shown, it would affect existing
legal rights and obligations of the Parties. In case of the success of the
Applicant, it would ensure for it advantages on the legal plane. In the
event, on the other hand, of the Respondent being successful, it would
benefit that Party by removing the threat of an unfounded claim. Thus a
judgment on the legality of atmospheric nuclear tests would, as stated by
the Court in the Northern Cameroons case:

‘“. .. have some practical consequence in the sense that it can affect
existing legal rights or obligations of the parties, thus removing
uncertainty from their legal relations” (I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 34).

In the light of this statement, a declaratory judgment stating the general
legal position applicable between the Parties—as would the one pro-
nouncing on the first part of the Applicant’s submission—would have
given the Parties certainty as to their legal relations. This desired result is
not satisfied by a finding by the Court of the existence of a unilateral
engagement based on a series of declarations which are somewhat diver-
gent and are not accompanied by an acceptance of the Applicant’s legal
contentions.

Moreover, the Court’s finding as to that unilateral engagement
regarding the recurrence of atmospheric nuclear tests cannot, we think,
be considered as affording the Applicant legal security of the same kind
or degree as would result from a declaration by the Court specifying that
such tests contravened general rules of international law applicable
between France and Australia. This is shown by the very fact that the
Court was able to go only so far as to find that the French Government's
unilateral undertaking ‘‘cannot be interpreted as having been made in
implicit reliance on an arbitrary power of reconsideration” (emphasis
added); and that the obligation undertaken is one “the precise nature and
limits of which must be understood in accordance with the actual terms
in which they have been publicly expressed”.

21. Whatever may be thought of the Judgment in the Northern
Cameroons case, the Court in that case recognized a critically significant
distinction between holding a declaratory judgment to be “without
effect” the subject of which (as in that case) was a treaty which was no
longer in force and one which “interprets a treaty that remains in force”
(emphasis added) or ‘“‘expounds a rule of customary law” (emphasis
added). As to both the latter, the Court said that the declaratory judg-
ment would have a ‘‘continuing applicability” (I.C.J. Reports 1963,
p. 37). In other words, according to the Northern Cameroons case a judg-
ment cannot be said to be “without effect” or an issue moot when it
concerns an analysis of the continuing applicability of a treaty in force
or of customary international law. That is precisely the situation in the
present case.

The present case, as submitted by the Applicant, concerns the conti-
nuing applicability of a potentially evolving customary international law,
elaborated at numerous points in the Memorial and oral arguments.
Whether all or any of the contentions of the Applicant would or would
not be vindicated at the stage of the merits is irrelevant to the central
issue that they are not manifestly frivolous or vexatious but are attended
by legal consequences in which the Applicant has a legal interest. In the
language of the Northern Cameroons case, a judgment dealing with them
would have “continuing applicability”. Issues of both fact and law re-
main to be clarified and resolved.

The distinction drawn in the Northern Cameroons case is thus in
keeping with the fundamental purpose of a declaratory judgment which
is designed, in contentious proceedings involving a genuine dispute, to
clarify and stabilize the legal relations of the parties. By foreclosing any
argument on the merits in the present stage of the proceedings the Court
has precluded this possibility. Accordingly, the Court, in our view, has
not only wrongly interpreted the thrust of the Applicant’s submissions,
is has also failed to recognize the valid role which a declaratory judgment
may play in reducing uncertainties in the legal relations of the parties
and in composing potential discord.

22. In paragraph 23 the Judgment states that the Court has “inherent”
jurisdiction enabling it to take such action as may be required. It asserts
that it must “ensure” the observance of the “inherent limitations on the
exercise of the judicial function of the Court” and “maintain its judicial



character”. It cites the Northern Cameroons case in support of these very
general statements.

Without pausing to analyse the meaning of the adjective “inherent”,
it is our view that there is nothing whatever in the concept of the integrity
of the judicial process (“inherent” or otherwise) which suggests, much
less compels, the conclusion that the present case has become “without
object”. Quite the contrary, due regard for the judicial function, properly
understood, dictates the reverse.

The Court, “whose function is to decide in accordance with interna-
tional law such disputes as are submitted to it” (Art. 38, para. 1, of the
Statute), has the duty to hear and determine the cases it is seised of and is
competent to examine. It has not the discretionary power of choosing
those contentious cases it will decide and those it will not. Not merely
requirements of judicial propriety, but statutory provisions governing
the Court’s constitution and functions impose upon it the primary obli-
gation to adjudicate upon cases brought before it with respect to which it
possesses jurisdiction and finds no ground of inadmissibility. In our view,
for the Court to discharge itself from carrying out that primary obligation
must be considered as highly exceptional and a step to be taken only
when the most cogent considerations of judicial propriety so require.
In the present case we are very far from thinking that any such consi-
derations exist.

23. Furthermore, any powers which may attach to “the inherent
jurisdiction” of the Court and its duty ‘‘to maintain its judicial character”
invoked in the Judgment would, in our view, require it at least to give a
hearing to the Parties or to request their written observations on the
questions dealt with and determined by the Judgment. This applies in
particular to the objectives the Applicant was pursuing in the proceed-
ings, and to the question of the status and scope of the French declara-
tions concerning future tests. Those questions could not be examined
fully and substantially in the pleadings and hearings, since the Parties
had received definite directions from the Court that the proceedings
should “first be addressed to the questions of the jurisdiction of the Court
to entertain the dispute, and of the admissibility of the Application”. No
intimation or suggestion was ever given to the Parties that this direction
was no longer in effect or that the Court would go into other issues which
were neither pleaded nor argued but which now form the basis for the
final disposal of the case.

It is true that counsel for the Applicant alluded to the first French
declaration of intention during one of the hearings, but he did so only as
a prelude to his treatment of the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility
and in the context of a review of developments in relation to the pro-
ceedings. He was moreover then acting under formal directions from the
Court to deal exclusively with the questions of jurisdiction and admissi-
bility of the Application. Consequently, counsel for the Applicant could
not and did not address himself to the specific issues now decided in the
Judgment, namely what were the objectives sought by the Applicant by



the judicial proceedings and whether the French declarations and state-
ments had the effect of rendering the claim of Australia without object.

The situation is in this respect entirely different from that arising in the
Northern Cameroons case where the Parties had full opportunity to plead,
both orally and in writing, the question whether the claim of the Appli-
cant had an object or had become “moot” before this was decided by the
Court.

Accordingly, there is a basic contradiction when the Court invokes its
“inherent jurisdiction” and its “judicial character” to justify its disposal
of the case, while, at the same time, failing to accord the Applicant any
opportunity whatever to present a countervailing argument.

No-one doubts that the Court has the power in its discretion to decide
certain issues ex proprio motu. The real question is not one of power, but
whether the exercise of power in a given case is consonant with the due
administration of justice. For all the reasons noted above, we are of the
view that, in the circumstances of this case, to decide the issue of “moot-
ness” without affording the Applicant any opportunity to submit counter-
arguments is not consonant with the due administration of justice.

In addition, we think that the Respondent should at least have been
notified that the Court was proposing to consider the possible effect on
the present proceedings of declarations of the French Government
relating to its policy in regard to the conduct of atmospheric tests in the
future. This was essential, we think, since it might, and did in fact lead
the Court to pronounce upon nothing less than France’s obligations, said
to have been unilaterally undertaken, with respect to the conduct of such
tests.

to the relationship between the issue of mootness and the requirements
of the judicial process.

[tis worth observing that a finding that the Applicant’s claim no longer
has any object is only another way of saying that the Applicant no longer
has any stake in the outcome. Located in the context of an adversary
proceeding, the implication is significant.

If the Applicant no longer has a stake in the outcome, i.e., if the case
is really moot, then the judicial process tends to be weakened, inasmuch
as the prime incentive for the Applicant to argue the law and facts with
sufficient vigour and thoroughness is diluted. This is one of the reasons
which justifies declaring a case moot, since the integrity of the judicial
process presupposes the existence of conflicting interests and requires
not only that the parties be accorded a full opportunity to explore and
expose the law and facts bearing on the controversy but that they have
the incentive to do so.

Applied to the present case, it is immediately apparent that this reason


for declaring a case moot or without object is totally missing, a conclusion
which is not nullified by the absence of the Respondent in this particular
instance.

The Applicant, with industry and skill, has already argued the nature
of its continuing legal interest in the dispute and has urged upon the
Court the need to explore the matter more fully at the stage of the merits.
The inducement to do so is hardly lacking in light of the Applicant’s
submissions and the nature and purposes of a declaratory judgment.

25. Furthermore the Applicant’s continued interest is manifested by
its conduct. If, as the Judgment asserts, all the Applicant’s objectives have
been met, it would have been natural for the Applicant to have requested
a discontinuance of the proceedings under Article 74 of the Rules. This it
has not done. Yet this Article, together with Article 73 on settlement,
provides for the orderly regulation of the termination of proceedings once
these have been instituted. Both Articles require formal procedural
actions by agents, in writing, so as to avoid misunderstandings, protect
the interests of each of the two parties and provide the Court with the
certainty and security necessary in judicial proceedings.

*

26. Finally, we believe the Court should have proceeded, under Article
36 (6) and Article 53 of the Statute, to determine its own jurisdiction with
respect to the present dispute. This is particularly important in this case

diction at the time the Application was filed, and, consequently, the pro-
per seising of the Court, alleging that the 1928 General Act is not a
treaty in force and that the French reservation concerning matters of na-
tional defence made the Court manifestly incompetent in this dispute. In
the Northern Cameroons case, invoked in paragraph 23 of the Judgment,
while the Respondent had raised objections to the jurisdiction of the
Court, it recognized that the Trusteeship Agreement was a convention in
force at the time of the filing of the Application. There was no question
then that the Court had been regularly seised by way of application.

27. In our view, for the reasons developed in the second part of this
opinion, the Court undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction in this dispute. The
Judgment, however, avoids the jurisdictional issue, asserting that ques-
tions related to the observance of ‘“the inherent limitations on the exercise
of the Court’s judicial function” require to be-examined in priority to
matters of jurisdiction (paras. 22 and 23). We cannot agree with this asser-
tion. The existence or lack of jurisdiction with respect to a specific dispute
is a basic statutory limitation on the exercise of the Court’s judicial
function and should therefore have been determined in the Judgment as
Article 67, paragraph 6, of the Rules of Court seems clearly to expect.



28. Tt is difficult for us to understand the basis upon which the Court
could reach substantive findings of fact and law such as those imposing
on France an international obligation to refrain from further nuclear
tests in the Pacific, from which the Court deduces that the case “no
longer has any object”, without any prior finding that the Court is
properly seised of the dispute and has jurisdiction to entertain it. The
present Judgment by implication concedes that a dispute existed at the
time of the Application. That differentiates this case from those in which
the issue centres on the existence ab initio of any dispute whatever. The
findings made by the Court in other cases as to the existence of a dispute
at the time of the Application were based on the Court’s jurisdiction to
determine its own competence, under the Statute. But in the present case
the Judgment disclaims any exercise of that statutory jurisdiction. Ac-
cording to the Judgment the dispute has disappeared or has been resolved
by engagements resulting from unilateral statements in respect of which
the Court “holds that they constitute an undertaking possessing legal
effect” (para. 51) and ‘“‘finds that France has undertaken the obligation,
to hold no further nuclear tests in the atmosphere in the South Pacific”
(para. 52). In order to make such a series of findings the Court must pos-
sess jurisdiction enabling it to examine and determine the legal effect of
certain statements and declarations which it deems relevant and connected
to the original dispute. The invocation of an alleged “inherent juris-
diction . . . to provide for the orderly settlement of all matters in dispute”
in paragraph 23 cannot provide a basis to support the conclusions
reached in the present Judgment which pronounce upon the substantive
rights and obligations of the Parties. An extensive interpretation appears
to be given in the Judgment to that inherent jurisdiction “on the basis of
which the Court is fully empowered to make whatever findings may be
necessary for the purposes of” providing “for the orderly settlement of all
matters in dispute” (para. 23). But such an extensive interpretation of the
alleged “inherent jurisdiction” would blur the line between the juris-
diction conferred to the Court by the Statute and the jurisdiction resulting
from the agreement of States. In consequence, it would provide an easy
and unacceptable way to bypass a fundamental requirement firmly
established in the jurisprudence of the Court and international law in
general, namely that the jurisdiction of the Court is based on the consent
of States.

The conclusion thus seems to us unavoidable that the Court, in the
process of rendering the present Judgment, has exercised substantive
Jurisdiction without having first made a determination of its existence and
the legal grounds upon which that jurisdiction rests.

29. Indeed, there seems to us to be a manifest contradiction in the
jurisdictional position taken up by the Court in the Judgment. If the
so-called “inherent jurisdiction” is considered by the Court to authorize
it to decide that France is now under a legal obligation to terminate



atmospheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific Ocean, why does the
“inherent jurisdiction” not also authorize it on the basis of that same
international obligation, to decide that the carrying out of any further
such tests would “not be consistent with applicable rules of international
law” and to order that ‘the French Republic shall not carry out any
further such tests”? In other words, if the Court may pronounce upon
France’s legal obligations with respect to atmospheric nuclear tests, why
does it not draw from this pronouncement the appropriate conclusions in
relation to the Applicant’s submissions instead of finding them no longer
to have any object? The above observation is made solely with reference
to the concept of “inherent jurisdiction” developed in the Judgment and
is of course not addressed to the merits of the case, which are not before
the Court at the present stage.

Since we consider a finding both as to the Court’s jurisdiction and as
to the admissibility of the Application to be an essential basis for the
conclusions reached in the Judgment as well as for our reasons for dis-
senting from those conclusions, we now proceed to examine in turn the
issues of jurisdiction and admissibility which confront the Court in the
present case.

30. At the outset of the present proceedings the French Government
categorically denied that the Court has any competence to entertain
Australia’s Application of 9 May 1973; and it has subsequently continued
to deny that there is any legal basis for the Court’s Order of 22 June 1973
indicating provisional measures of protection or for the exercise of any
jurisdiction by the Court with respect to the matters dealt with in the
Application. The Court, in making that Order for provisional measures,
stated that the material submitted to it led to the conclusion, at that stage
of the proceedings, that the jurisdictional provisions invoked by the
Applicant appeared “prima facie, to afford a basis on which the juris-
diction of the Court might be founded”. At the same time, it directed
that the questions of the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the dispute
and of the admissibility of the Application should be the subject of the
pleadings in the next stage of the case, that is, in the proceedings with
which the Court is now concerned. In our view, these further proceedings
confirm that the jurisdictional provisions invoked by the Applicant not
merely afforded a wholly sufficient basis for the Order of 22 June 1973
but also provided a valid basis for establishing the competence of the
Court in the present case.



31. The Application specifies as independent and alternative bases of
the Court’s jurisdiction:

“(i) Article 17 of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of Inter-
national Disputes, 1928, read together with Articles 36 (1) and
37 of the Statute of the Court. Australia and the French
Republic both acceded to the General Act on 21 May 1931. The
texts of the conditions to which their accessions were declared
to be subject are set forth in Annex 15 and Annex 16 respec-
tively.

(ii) Alternatively, Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the Court.
Australia and the French Republic have both made declarations
thereunder.”

It follows that, if these are indeed two independent and alternative ways
of access to the Court and one of them is shown to be effective to confer

32. Article 17 of the General Act of 1928 reads as follows:

“All disputes with regard to which the parties are in conflict as to
their respective rights shall, subject to any reservations which may
be made under Article 39, be submitted for decision to the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice, unless the parties agree, in the
manner hereinafter provided, to have resort to an arbitral tribunal.

It is understood that the disputes referred to above include in
particular those mentioned in Article 36 of the Statute of the Per-
manent Court of International Justice.”

The disputes “mentioned in Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent
Court” are all or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning:

(a) the interpretation of a treaty;

(b) any question of international law;

{c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a
breach of an international obligation;

(d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of
an international obligation.



33. The same four classes of legal disputes are reproduced word for
word, in Article 36 (2)—the optional clause—of the Statute of the present
Court which, together with the declarations of Australia and France,
constitutes the second basis of jurisdiction invoked in the Application.

34. Accordingly, the jurisdiction conferred on the Court under Article

Statute, in principle, covers the same disputes: namely the four classes
of legal disputes listed above. In the present instance, however, the bases
of jurisdiction resulting from these instruments are clearly not co-exten-
sive because of certain differences between the terms of the Parties’
accessions to the General Act and the terms of their declarations accep-
ting the optional clause. In particular, France’s declaration under the
optional clause excepts from the Court’s jurisdiction “disputes concerning
activities connected with national defence’, whereas no such exception
appears in her accession to the General Act of 1928. Consequently, it is
necessary to examine the two bases of jurisdiction separately.

35. The French Government, in its letter of 16 May 1973 addressed
to the Registrar, and in the Annex to that letter, put forward the view
that the present status of the General Act of 1928 and the attitude of the
Parties, more especially of France, in regard to it preclude that Act from
being considered today as a clear expression of France’s will to accept the
Court’s jurisdiction. It maintained that, since the demise of the League of
Nations, the Act of 1928 is recognized either as no longer being in force
or as having lost its efficacy or as having fallen into desuetude. In support
of this view, the French Government agreed that the Act of 1928 was,
ideologically, an integral part of the League of Nations system “in so far
as the pacific settlement of international disputes had necessarily in that
system to accompany collective security and disarmament’; that there
was correspondingly a close link between the Act and the structures of
the League, the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Council,
the Secretary-General, the States Members and the Secretariat; that these
links were emphasized in the terms of certain of the accessions to the Act,
including those of Australia, New Zealand and France; and that this
was also shown by the fact that Australia and New Zealand, in acceding
to the Act, made reservations regarding disputes with States not members
of the League. It further argued that the integration of the Act into the
structure of the League of Nations was shown by the fact that, after the
latter’s demise, the necessity was recognized of a revision of the Act, sub-
stituting new terms for those of the defunct system instead merely of
relying on the operation of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court. This,
according to the French Government, implied that the demise of the



League was recognized as having rendered it impossible for the General
Act of 1928 to continue to function normally.

36. The fact that the text of the General Act of 1928 was drawn up
and adopted within the League of Nations does not make it a treaty of
that Organization; for even a treaty adopted within an organization
remains the treaty of its parties. Furthermore, the records of the
League of Nations Assembly show that it was deliberately decided not to
make the General Act an integral part of the League of Nations structure
(Ninth Ordinary Session, Minutes of the First Committee, p. 68); that
the General Act was not intended to be regarded as a constitutional
document of the League or adjunct of the Covenant (ibid., p. 69); that
the General Act was envisaged as operating parallel to, and not as part
of the League of Nations system (ibid., p. 71); and that the substantive
obligations of the parties under the General Act were deliberately made
independent of the functions of the League of Nations. Stressing the last
point, Mr. Rolin of Belgium said specifically:

“The intervention of the Council of the League was not implied
as a matter of necessity in the General Act; the latter had been
regarded as being of use in connection with the general work of the
League, but it had no administrative or constitutional relationship with
it.” (Ibid., p. 71; emphasis added.)

That the French Government also then understood the pacific settlement
system embodied in the General Act to be independent of that of the
Covenant of the League of Nations was made clear when the ratification
of the Act was laid before the French Chambre des deputés, whose Com-


*“... alors que, dans le système conçu par les fondateurs de la Société
des Nations, l’action du Conseil, telle quelle est prévue par l’article 15,
constitue un mode normal de règlement des différends au même
titre que la procédure d'arbitrage, /’Acte général, au contraire, ignore
complètement le Conseil de la Société des Nations” (Journal officiel,
documents parlementaires, Chambre, 1929, p. 407; emphasis added).

37. Australia and France, it is true, inserted reservations in their
accessions to the General Act designed to ensure the priority of the
powers of the Council of the League over the obligations which they were
assuming by acceding to the Act. But the fact that they and some other
States thought it desirable so to provide in their instruments of accession



seems to testify to the independent and essentially autonomous character
of the General Act rather than to its integration in the League of Nations
system. Similarly, the fact that, in order to exclude disputes with non-
member States from their acceptance of obligations under the Act,
Australia and some other States inserted an express reservation of such
disputes in their instruments of accession, serves only to underline that
the Covenant and the General Act were separate systems of pacific
settlement. The reservation was needed for the very reason that the Gen-
eral Act was established as a universal system of pacific settlement inde-
pendent of the League of Nations and open to States not members of the
Organization, as well as to Members (cf. Report of Mr. Politis, as
Rapporteur, 18th Plenary Meeting of 25 September 1928, at p. 170).

38. Nor do we find any more convincing the suggested “ideological
integration” of the General Act in the League of Nations system: i.e.,
the thesis of its inseparable connection with the League's trilogy of col-
lective security, disarmament and pacific settlement. Any mention of a
connection between those three subjects is conspicuously absent from the
General Act, which indeed makes no reference at all to security or dis-
armament, unlike certain other instruments of the same era. In these
circumstances, the suggestion that the General Act was so far intertwined
with the League of Nations system of collective security and disarma-

as having any solid basis.

39. Indeed, if that suggestion had a sound basis, it would signify the
extinction of numerous other treaties of pacific settlement belonging to
the same period and having precisely the same ideological approach as
the General Act of 1928. Yet these treaties, without any steps having
been taken to amend or to “confirm” them, are unquestionably con-
sidered as having remained in force despite the dissolution of the League
of Nations in 1946. As evidence of this two examples will suffice: the
Hispano-Belgian Treaty of Conciliation, Judicial Settlement and Ar-
bitration of 19 July 1927, Article 17 of which was applied by this Court
as the source of its jurisdiction in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited case (I.C.J. Reports 1964, at pp. 26-39); and the Franco-
Spanish Treaty of Arbitration of 10 July 1929 on the basis of which
France herself and Spain constituted the Lac Lanoux arbitration in 1956
(UNRIAA, Vol. 12, at p. 285). In truth, these treaties and the General Act
itself, although largely inspired by the League of Nations aim of pro-
moting the peaceful settlement of disputes together with collective
security and disarmament, also took their inspiration from the movement
for the development of international arbitration and judicial settlement
which had grown up during the nineteenth century and had played a
major role at the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907. It was,
moreover, the French Government itself which in the General Assembly
in 1948 emphasized this quite separate source of the “ideology” of the
General Act of 1928. Having referred to the General Act as “a valuable



document inherited from the League of Nations”, the French delegation
added that it constituted:

. an integral part of a long tradition of arbitration and con-
ciliation which had proved itself effective long before the existence
of the League itself” (GA, OR, Third Session, Plenary Meeting,
199th Meeting, p. 193).

That tradition certainly did not cease with the League of Nations.

40. The General Act of 1928 was, however, a creation of the League of
Nations era, and the machinery of pacific settlement which it established
almost inevitably exhibited some marks of that origin. Thus, the tribunal
to which judicial settlement was to be entrusted was the Permanent Court
of International Justice (Art. 17); if difficulties arose in agreeing upon
members of a conciliation commission, the parties were empowered, as
one possible option, to entrust the appointment to the President of the
Council of the League (Art. 6); the .Conciliation Commission was to
meet at the seat of the League, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or
otherwise decided by the Commission’s President (Art. 9); a Conciliation
Commission was also empowered in all circumstances to request assis-
tance from the Secretary-General of the League (Art. 9); if a deadlock
arose in effecting the appointment of members of an arbitral tribunal, the

of the Permanent Court of International Justice (Art. 23); in cases sub-
mitted to the Permanent Court, it was empowered to lay down ‘‘pro-
visional measures” (Art. 33), and to decide upon any third party’s re-
quest to intervene (Art. 36) and its Registrar was required to notify other
parties to a multilateral convention the construction of which was in
question (Art, 37); the Permanent Court was also entrusted with a
general power to determine disputes relating to the interpretation or
application of the Act (Art. 41); the power to extend invitations to non-
member States to become parties to the General Act was entrusted to
the Council of the League (Art. 43); and, finally, the depositary functions
in connection with the Act were entrusted to the Secretary-General of the
League (Arts. 43-47). The question has therefore to be considered whether
these various links with the Permanent Court and with the Council of the
League of Nations and its Secretariat are of such a character that the
dissolution of these organs in 1946 had the necessary result of rendering
the General Act of 1928 unworkable and virtually a dead letter.



41. In answering this question, account has first to be taken of Article
37 of the Statute of this Court, on which the Applicant specifically relies
for the purpose of founding the Court’s jurisdiction on Article 17 of the
1928 Act. Article 37 of the Statute reads:

“Whenever a treaty or convention in force provides for reference
of a matter . . . to the Permanent Court of International Justice, the
matter shall, as between the parties to the present Statute, be referred
to the International Court of Justice.”

The objects and purposes of that provision were examined at length by
this Court in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited
case (New Application, Preliminary Objections, 1.C.J. Reports 1964, at
pp. 31-36) where, inter alia, it said:

“The intention therefore was to create a special régime which, as
between the parties to the Statute, would automatically transform
references to the Permanent Court in these jurisdictional clauses,
into references to the present Court.

In these circumstances it is difficult to suppose that those who
framed Article 37 would willingly have contemplated, and would not
have intended to avoid, a situation in which the nullification of the

would be brought about by the very event—the disappearance of the
Permanent Court—the effects of which Article 37 both foresaw and
was intended to parry; or that they would have viewed with equa-
nimity the possibility that, although the Article would preserve many
jurisdictional clauses, there might be many others which it would not;
thus creating that very situation of diversification and imbalance
which it was desired to avoid.” (P. 31, emphasis added.)

In a later passage the Court was careful to enter the caveat that Article 37
was not intended ‘to prevent the operation of causes of extinction other
than the disappearance of the Permanent Court” (ibid., p. 34). However,
it continued:

“And precisely because it was the sole object of Article 37 to
prevent extinction resulting from the particular cause which the
disappearance of the Permanent Court would represent, it cannot be
admitted that this extinction should in fact proceed to follow from this
very event itself.” (Ibid., emphasis added.)

42. The Court’s observations in that case apply inevery particular to the

was in itself wholly insufficient to bring about the termination of the Act.
Unless some other ‘‘cause of extinction’ is shown to prevent the Act
from being considered as “a treaty or convention in force” at the date
of the dissolution of the Permament Court, Article 37 of the Statute
automatically has the effect of substituting this Court for thé Permanent
Court as the tribunal designated in Article 17 of the General Act for the



judicial settlement of disputes. And Article 37, in our opinion, also has
the effect of automatically substituting this Court for the Permanent
Court in Articles 33, 36, 37 and 41 of the General Act.

43. Account has further to be taken of the arrangements reached in
1946 between the Assembly of the League and the General Assembly of
the United Nations for the transfer to the United Nations Secretariat of
the depositary functions performed by the League Secretariat with respect
to treaties. Australia and France, as Members of both organizations, were
parties to these arrangements and are, therefore, clearly bound by them.
In September 1945 the League drew up a List of Conventions with Indi-
cation of the Relevant Articles Conferring Powers on the Organs of the
League of Nations, the purpose of which was to facilitate consideration
of the transfer of League functions to the United Nations in certain
fields. In this list appeared the General Act of 1928, and there can be no
doubt that when resolutions of the two Assemblies provided in 1946 for
the transfer of the depository functions of the League Secretariat to the
United Nations Secretariat, the 1928 Act was understood as, in principle,
included in those resolutions. Thus, the first list published by the Secre-
tary-General in 1949 of multilateral treaties in respect of which he acts as
depositary contained the General Act of 1928 (Signatures, Ratifications,
Acceptances, Accessions, etc, concerning the Multilateral Conventions and
Agreements in respect of which the Secretary-General acts as Depositary,
UN Publications, 1949, Vol. 9). Moreover, in a letter of 12 June 1974,
addressed to Australia’s Permanent Representative and presented by
Australia to the Court, the Secretary-General expressly confirmed that
the 1928 Act was one of the “multilateral treaties placed under the custody
of the Secretary-General by virtue of General Assembly resolution 24 (1)
of 12 February 1946”.

the depositary functions entrusted to the Secretary-General and Secre-
tariat of the League of Nations by Articles 43 to 47 of the 1928 Act were
automatically transferred to the Secretary-General and Secretariat of the
United Nations. It follows that the demise of the League of Nations
could not possibly constitute ‘‘a cause of extinction” of the General Act
by reason of the references to the League Secretariat in those Articles.

45. The disappearance of the League of Nations system, it is true, did
slightly impair the full efficacy of the machinery provided for in the 1928
Act. In conciliation, recourse could no longer be had to the President of



the Council as one of the means provided by Article 6 of the Act for
resolving disagreements in the appointment of members of the concilia-
tion commission; nor could the commission any longer assert the right
under Article 9 of the Act to meet at the seat of the League and to request
assistance from the Secretary-General of the League. As to arbitration, it
became doubtful whether Article 37 of the Statute would suffice, in the
event of the parties’ disagreement, to entrust to the President of this
Court the extra-judicial function of appointing members of an arbitral
tribunal entrusted by Article 23 of the 1928 Act to the President of the
Permanent Court. In both conciliation and arbitration, however, the
provisions involving League organs concerned machinery of a merely
alternative or ancillary character, the disappearance of which could not
be said to render the 1928 Act as a whole unworkable or impossible of

mental change of circumstances as might afford a ground for terminating
or withdrawing from the treaty (cf. Art. 62 of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties). Moreover, none of these provisions touched, still
less impaired, the procedure for judicial settlement laid down in Article 17
of the 1928 Act.

46. Another provision the efficacy of which was impaired by the dis-
solution of the League was Article 43, under which the power to open
accession to the General Act to additional States was given to the Council
of the League. The disappearance of the Council put an end to this method
of widening the operation of the 1928 Act and prejudiced, in conse-
quence, the achievement of a universal system of pacific settlement foun-
ded on the Act. It did not, however, impair in any way the operation
of the Act as between its parties. Indeed, in principle, it did not preclude
the parties to the Act from agreeing among themselves to open it to
accession by additional States.

47. Analysis of the relevant provisions of the General Act of 1928 thus
suffices, by itself, to show that neither the dissolution of 1946 of the

of the League of Nations can be considered as ‘‘a cause of extinction” of
the Act. This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the fact, already
mentioned, that a large number of treaties for the pacific settlement of
disputes, clauses of which make reference to organs of the League, are
undoubtedly accepted as still in force; and that some of them have been
applied in practice since the demise of the League. For present purposes,
it is enough to mention the application by France herself and by Spain
of their bilateral Treaty of Arbitration of 10 July 1929 as the basis for the
constitution of the Lac Lanoux Arbitral Tribunal in 1956 (UNRIAA, Vol.
12, at p. 285). That convention was conspicuously a treaty of the League
of Nations era, containing references to the Covenant and to the Council
of the League as well as to the Permanent Court. Moreover, some of those
references did not deal with the mere machinery of peaceful settlement



procedures, but with matters of substance. Article 20, for example, ex-
pressly reserved to the parties, in certain events, a right of unilateral
application to the Council of the League; and Article 21, which required
provisional measures to be laid down by any tribunal dealing with a

of the League of Nations, if the question is brought before it, to ensure
that suitable provisional measures be taken”. Those Articles provided
for much more substantial links with organs of the League than anything
contained in the 1928 Act; yet both France and Spain appear to have
assumed that the treaty was in force in 1956 notwithstanding the demise
of the League.

The So-Called Revision of the General Act

48. In the case of the 1928 Act, the French Government maintains
that the so-called revision of the General Act undertaken by the General
Assembly in 1948 implies that the demise of the League was recognized
as having rendered it impossible for the 1928 Act to continue to function
normally. This interpretation of the proceedings of the General Assembly
and the Interim Committee regarding the ‘‘revision” of the Act does not
seem to us sustainable. Belgium introduced her proposal for the revision
of the 1928 Act in the Interim Committee at a time when the General
Assembly was engaged in revising a number of treaties of the League of
Nations era in order to bring their institutional machinery and their
terminology into line with the then new United Nations system. It is

of functions already effected by Article 37 of the Statute and General
Assembly resolution 24 (I), the Interim Committee and the General
Assembly should have concerned themselves with the replacement of the
references in the General Act to the Permanent Court, the Council of the
League and the League Secretariat by references to their appropriate
counterparts in the United Nations system.

49. In any event, what began as a proposal for the revision of the 1928
General Act was converted in the Interim Committee into the preparation
of a text of a new Revised General Act which was to be opened for acces-
sion as an entirely independent treaty. This was to avoid the difficulty
that certain of the parties to the 1928 Act, whose agreement was necessary
for its revision, were not members of the United Nations and not taking
part in the revision (cf. Arts. 39 and 40 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties). As the Belgian delegation explained to the Interim
Committee, the consent of the parties to the 1928 Act would now be
unnecessary ‘’since in its final form their proposal did not suppress or

therefore, whatever rights the parties to that Act might still derive from it”
(emphasis added). This explanation was included in the Committee’s
report to the General Assembly and, in our opinion, clearly implies that
the 1928 Act was recognized to be a treaty still in force in 1948. Moreover,
the records of the debates contain a number of statements by individual
delegations indicating that the 1928 Act was then understood by them
to be in force; and those statements did not meet with contradiction from
any quarter.

50. Equally, the mere fact that the General Assembly drew up and
opened for accession a new Revised General Act could not have the
effect of putting an end to, or undermining the validity of, the 1928 Act.
In the case of the amendment of multilateral treaties, the principle is
well settled that the amending treaty exists side by side with the original
treaty, the latter remaining in force unamended as between those of its
parties which have not established their consent to be bound by the
amending treaty (cf. Art. 40 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties). Numerous examples of the application of this principle are to
be found precisely in the practice of the United Nations regarding the
amendment of League of Nations Treaties; and it was this principle to
which the General Assembly gave expression in the preamble to its reso-
lution 268A (111), by which it instructed the Secretary-General to prepare
and open to accession the text of the Revised Act. The preamble to the
resolution, inter alia, declared:

“Whereas the General Act, thus amended, will only apply as

affect the rights of such States, parties to the Act as established on
26 September 1928, as should claim to invoke it in so far as it might
still be operative.” (Emphasis added.)

It is therefore evident that the General Assembly neither intended that
the Revised General Act should put an end to its predecessor, the 1928
Act, nor understood that this would be the result of its adoption of the
Revised Act. Such an intention in the General Assembly would indeed
have been surprising when it is recalled that the ‘‘revision” of the General
Act was undertaken in the context of a programme for encouraging the
development of methods for the pacific settlement of disputes.

51. In the above-quoted clause of the preamble, it is true, resolution
268A (III) qualifies the statement that the amendments would not affect
rights of parties to the 1928 Act by the words “in so far as it might still be
operative”. Moreover, in another clause of the preamble the resolution
also speaks of its being “expedient to restore to the General Act its
original efficacy, impaired by the fact that the organs of the League of
Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice to which it
refers have now disappeared”. We cannot, however, accept the suggestion
that by these phrases the General Assembly implied that the 1928 Act



was no longer capable of functioning normally. These phrases find a
sufficient explanation in the fact, which we have already mentioned, that
the disappearance of the League organs and the Permanent Court would
affect certain provisions regarding alternative methods for setting up
conciliation commissions or arbitral tribunals, which might in the event
of disagreements impair the efficacy of the procedures provided by the
Act.

52. But there was also another reason for including those words in the
preamble to which the Interim Committee drew attention in its report
(UN doc. A/605, para. 46):

“Thanks to a few alterations, the new General Act would, for the
benefit of those States acceding thereto, restore the original effec-
tiveness of the machinery provided in the Act of 1928, an Act
which, though still theoretically in existence, has largely become


It was noted, for example, that the provisions of the Act relating
to the Permanent Court of International Justice had lost much of their
effectiveness in respect of parties which are not members of the United
Nations or parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice.”
(Emphasis added.)

In 1948 several parties to the 1928 Act were neither members of the
United Nations nor parties to the Statute of this Court so that, even
with the aid of Article 37 of the Statute, the provisions in the 1928 Act
on judicial settlement were not ‘operative’ as between them and other
parties to the Act. Therefore, in this respect also it could properly be said
that the original efficacy of the 1928 Act had been impaired. On the other
hand, the clear implication, a contrario, of the Interim Committee's
report was that the provisions of the 1928 Act concerning judicial settle-
ment—Article 17—had not lost their efficacy as between those of its
parties who were parties to the Statute of this Court.

The Question of the Continued Force of the 1928 Act

53. Equally, we do not find convincing the thesis put forward by the
French Government that the 1928 Act cannot serve as a basis for the
competence of the Court because of “the desuetude into which it has
fallen since the demise of the League of Nations system”. Desuetude is
not mentioned in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as one of
the grounds for termination of treaties, and this omission was deli-



berate. As the International Law Commission explained in its report on


“... while ‘obsolescence’ or ‘desuetude’ may be a factual cause of
the termination of a treaty, the legal basis of such termination, when
it occurs, is the consent of the parties to abandon the treaty, which
is to be implied from their conduct in relation to the treaty” (Year-
book of the International Law Commission, 1966, Vol. 11, p. 237).

In the present instance, however, we find it impossible to imply from the
conduct of the parties in relation to the 1928 Act, and more especially
from that of France prior to the filing of the Application in this case,
their consent to abandon the Act.

54. Admittedly, until recently the Secretary-General was not called
upon to register any new accession or other notification in relation to the
1928 Act. But this cannot be considered as evidence of a tacit agreement
to abandon the treaty, since multilateral treaties not infrequently remain
in force for long periods without any changes in regard to their parties.

55. Nor is such evidence to be found in the fact, referred to in the
Annex to the French Government's letter of 16 May 1973, that ‘Australia
and Canada did not feel, in regard to the Act, any need to regularize
their reservations of 1939 as they did those expressed with regard to
their optional declarations”. The reservations in question, made by both
countries four days after the outbreak of the Second World War, notified
the depositary that they would not regard their accessions to the 1928
Act as “covering or relating to any dispute arising out of events occurring
during the present crisis”. These reservations were not in accord with
Article 45 of the 1928 Act, which permitted modification of the terms of

the Act runs unless denounced. But both countries justified the reserva-
tions on the basis of the breakdown of collective security under the League
and the resulting fundamental changes in the circumstances existing
when they acceded to the Act; and if that justification was well founded
there was no pressing need to “‘regularize” their reservations in 1944
when the current five-year period was due to expire. Nor would it be
surprising if in that year of raging war all over the globe they should not
have had their attention turned to this question. Moreover, the para-
llelism suggested between the position of these two countries under the
1928 Act and under the optional clause is in any case inexact. Their
declarations under the optional clause expired in 1940, so that they were
called upon to re-examine their declarations; under Article 45 of the
1928 Act, on the other hand, their accessions remained in force inde-
finitely unless denounced.

56. A more general argument in the Annex to the letter of 16 May
1973, regarding a lack of parallelism in States’ acceptance respectively of
the 1928 Act and the optional clause, also appears to us unconvincing.



The desuetude of the 1928 Act, it is said, ought to be inferred from the
following facts: up to 1940 reservations made to the 1928 Act and to the
optional clause were always similar but after that date the parallelism
ceased ; reservations to the optional clause then became more restrictive
and yet the same States appeared unconcerned with the very broad
jurisdiction to which they are said to have consented under the Act.

57. Even before 1940, however, the suggested parallelism was by
no means complete. Thus, France's declaration of 19 September 1929,

of domestic jurisdiction which appeared in her accession to the 1928 Act;
and the declarations made in that period by Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and the United Kingdom did not exclude disputes with non-
member States, as did their accessions to the 1928 Act. The provisions of
Articles 39 and 45 of the Act in any case meant that there were material
differences in the conditions under which compulsory jurisdiction was
accepted under the two instruments. Moreover, even granting that
greater divergencies appear in the two systems after 1940, this is open to
other explanations than the supposed desuetude of the 1928 Act. The
more striking of these divergencies arise from reservations to the optional
clause directed to specific disputes either already existing or imminently
expected. Whereas under the optional clause many States have placed
themselves in a position to change the terms of their declarations in any
manner they may wish, without notice and with immediate effect, their
position under the 1928 General Act is very different by reason of the
provisions of Articles 39 and 45 regulating the making and taking effect
of reservations. Because of these provisions a new reservation to the
1928 Act directed to a specific matter of dispute may serve only to alert
the attention of the other party to the State’s obligations under the Act
and hasten a decision to institute proceedings before the reservation
becomes effective under Article 45. In short, any parallelism between the
optional clause and the 1928 Act is in this respect an illusion.

58. As to the further suggestion in the above-mentioned letter that if
the 1928 Act were still in force the refusal of Australia, New Zealand and
France to become parties to the Revised General Act would be difficult
to explain, this does not appear to us to bear a moment’s examination.
Since 1946, the 1928 Act has had a limited number of existing parties
and has been open to accession only by a small and finite group of other
States, while the Revised General Act is open to accession by a much

surprise that parties to the 1928 General Act should have been ready
simply to continue as such, while not prepared to take the new step of
assuming more wide-ranging commitments under the Revised Act. Even
more decisive is the fact that, of the six parties to the 1928 Act which have



become parties to the Revised Act, at least four are on record as formally
recognizing that the 1928 Act is also still in force for them.

59. It follows that, in our opinion, the various considerations advanced
in the French Government's letter and Annex of 16 May 1973 fall far
short of establishing its thesis that the 1928 Act must now be considered
as having fallen into desuetude. Even if this were not the case, the State
practice in relation to the Act in the post-war period, more especially
that of France herself, appears to us to render that thesis manifestly
untenable.

Evidence of the 1928 Act’s Continuance in Force

60. Between the dissolution of the League of Nations in April 1946 and
Australia’s invocation of the 1928 Act in her Application of 9 May 1973
there occurred a number of examples of State practice which confirm
that, so far from abandoning the Act, its parties continued to recognize it
as a treaty in force. The first was the conclusion of the Franco-Siamese
Settlement Agreement on 17 November 1946 for the purpose of re-estab-

ing friendly relations between the two countries. Siam was not a party
to the General Act of 1928, but in the Franco-Siamese Treaty of Friend-
ship of 1937 she had agreed to apply the provisions of the Act for the
settlement of any disputes with France. Under the Settlement Agreement
of 1946 France and Siam agreed to constitute immediately “a Concili-
ation Commission, composed of the representatives of the Parties and
three neutrals, in accordance with the General Act of Geneva of 26 Sep-
tember 1928 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, which
governs the constitution and working of the Commission”. The 1928
Act, it is true, applied between France and Siam, not as such, but only
through being incorporated by reference into the 1937 Treaty of Friend-
ship. But it is difficult to imagine that in November 1946, a few months
after she had participated in the dissolution of the League, France
should have revived the operation of the provisions of the 1928 Act in her
relations with Siam if she had believed the dissolution of the League to
have rendered that Act virtually defunct.

61. In 1948-1949, as we have already pointed out, a number of member
States in the debates and the General Assembly in resolution 268A (IH)

In 1948 also the 1928 Act was included in New Zealand's official treaty
list published in that year. Again, in 1949, the Norwegian Foreign
Minister, In reporting to parliament on the Revised Act, stated that the
1928 Act was still in force, and in 1950 the Swedish Government did
likewise in referring the Revised Act to the Swedish parliament. Similarly,



inannouncing Denmark's accession to the Revised Act in 1952, the Danish
Government referred to the 1928 Act as still in force.

62. Accordingly, France was doing no more than conform to the
general opinion when in 1956 and 1957 she made the 1928 Act one of the
bases of her claim against Norway before this Court in the Certain Norwe-
gian Loans case (1.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 9). Inthree separate passages of her
written pleadings France invoked the 1928 Act as a living, applicable,
treaty imposing an obligation upon Norway to submit the dispute to
arbitration; for in each of these passages she characterized Norway’s
refusal to accept arbitration as a violation, inter alia, of the General Act

pp. 172, 173 and 180). She did so again in a diplomatic Note of
17 September 1956, addressed to the Norwegian Government during the
course of the proceedings and brought to the attention of the Court (ibid.,
p. 211), and also at the oral hearings (ibid., Vol. II, p. 60). The reason
was that Norway's refusal to arbitrate was a specific element in the French
claim that Norway was not entitled unilaterally to modify the conditions
of the loans in question “without negotiation with the holders, with the
French State which has adopted the cause of its nationals, or without
arbitration ...” (I.C.J. Reports 1957, at. p 18, emphasis added). Conse-
quently, the explanation given in the Annex to the French Government's
letter of 16 May 1973 that it had confined itself in the Certain Norwegian
Loans case ‘to a very brief reference to the General Act, without relying
on it expressly as a basis of its claim”, is not one which it is possible to
accept.

63. Nor do we find the further explanation given by the French Govern-
ment in that Annex any more convincing. In effect this is that, if the 1928
Act had been considered by France to be valid at the time of the Certain
Norwegian Loans case, she would have used it to found the jurisdiction
of the Court in that case so as to “parry the objection which Norway was

Declaration”; and that her failure to found the Court’s jurisdiction on the
1928 Act ‘is only explicable by the conviction that in 1955 it had fallen
into desuetude’’. This explanation does not hold water for two reasons.
First, it does not account for the French Government’s repeated references
to the 1928 Act as imposing an obligation on Norway in 1955 to arbitrate,
one of which included a specific mention of Chapter II of the Act relating
to judicial settlement. Secondly, it is not correct that France, by founding
the Court’s jurisdiction on the Act, would have been able to escape the
objection to jurisdiction under the optional clause raised by Norway on



the basis of a reservation in France's declaration; and it is unnecessary to
look further than to Article 31, paragraph 1, of the 1928 Act for the
reason why France did not invoke the Act as a basis for the Court’s
jurisdiction. This paragraph reads:

“In the case of a dispute the occasion of which, according to the
municipal law of one of the parties, falls within the competence of its
judicial or administrative authorities, the party in question may object

methods laid down in the present General Act until a decision with final
effect has been pronounced . . .” (Emphasis added.)

Since the French bond holders had deliberately abstained from taking any
action in the Norwegian tribunals, the above clear and specific provision
of Article 31 constituted a formidable obstacle to establishing the Court’s
jurisdiction on the basis of the 1928 Act.

64. Thus, the position taken by France in the Certain Norwegian Loans
case, so far from being explicable only on the basis of a conviction of the

belief in its continued validity and efficacy at that date. As to Norway,
it is enough to recall her Government’s statement in Parliament in 1949
that the 1928 Act remained in force, and to add that at no point in the
Certain Norwegian Loans case did Norway question either the validity or the
efficacy of the Act as an instrument applicable between herself and France
at that date.

65. Furthermore, the interpretation placed inthe Annex onthe treatment
of the 1928 Act by the Court and Judge Basdevant in the Certain Norwegian
Loans case does not seem to us to be sustained by the record of the case.
The Court did not, as the French Government maintains, have to decide
the question of the 1928 Act. Stressing that France had based her Applica-
tion ‘‘clearly and precisely on the Norwegian and French declarations
under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute”, the Court held it “would
not be justified in seeking a basis for its jurisdiction different from that
which the French Government itself set out in its Application. ..”.

reference to the parties’ declarations under the optional clause and made
no mention of the 1928 Act. As to Judge Basdevant, at the outset of his
dissenting opinion (p. 71) he emphasized that on the question of jurisdic-
tion he did not dispute the point of departure on which the Court had
placed itself. In holding that the matters in dispute did not fall within the
reservation of matters of domestic jurisdiction, on the other hand, he
expressly relied on the 1928 Act as one of his grounds for so holding. The
fact that the Court did not follow him in this approach to the interpreta-
tion of the reservation cannot, in our view, be understood as meaning
that it rejected his view as to the 1928 Act’s being in force between France



and Norway. Indeed, if that had been the case, it is almost inconceivable
that Judge Basdevant'could have said, as he did, of the 1928 Act: “At
no time has any doubt been raised as to the fact that this Act is binding
as between France and Norway” (1.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 74).

66. The proceedings in the Certain Norwegian Loans case, therefore, in
themselves constitute unequivocal evidence that the 1928 Act did survive the

France, as in force in the period 1955-1957. We may add that in this
period statements by parties to the 1928 Act are also to be found in the
records of the proceedings of the Council of Europe leading to the adopt-
ing of the European Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Interna-
tional Disputes in 1957, which show that they considered the Act to be
still in force. A Danish delegate, for example, stated in the Consultative
Assembly in 1955, without apparent contradiction from anyone, that
the 1928 Act “binds twenty States”.

67. No suggestion is made in the letter of 16 May 1973 or its Annex
that, if the 1928 Act was in force in 1957, there was nevertheless some
development which deprived it of validity before Australia filed her
Application; nor does the information before the Court indicate that any
such development occurred. On the contrary, the evidence consistently
and pointedly confirms the belief of the parties to the 1928 Act as to its
continuance in force. In 1966 Canada’s official publication The Canada
Treaty Series: 1928-1964 listed the 1928 Act as in force; as likewise did
Finland’s list in the following year. In Sweden the treaty list published by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1969 included the 1928 Act, with a

lands Minister for Foreign Affairs, in submitting the Revised Act for
parliamentary approval, referred to the 1928 Act as an agreement to
which the Netherlands is a party and, again, as an Act “which is still in
force for 22 States”; and Australia’s own official treaty list published in
that year included the 1928 Act. In addition, the 1928 Act appears in a
number of unofficial treaty lists compiled in different countries.

68. As to France herself, there is nothing in the evidence to show any
change of position on her part regarding the 1928 Act prior to the filing of
Australia’s Application on 9 May 1973. Indeed, a written reply to a
deputy in the National Assembly, explaining why France was not con-
templating ratification of the European Convention for the Pacific
Settlement of Disputes, gives the opposite impression. That reply stated
that, like the majority of European States, France was already bound by
numerous obligations of pacific settlement amongst which was mentioned
“I’Acte général d’arbitrage du 26 septembre 1928 revisé en 1949”. The



French Government, in a footnote in the Livre blanc sur les expériences
nucléaires, has drawn attention to the confused character of the reference
to the 1928 Act revised in 1949. Even so, and however defective the

other way than as confirming the position taken up by the French
Government in the Certain Norwegian Loans case, that the 1928 Act was to
be considered as a treaty in force with respect to France; for France had not
ratified the Revised General Act and could be referred to as bound by the
General Act only in its original form, the 1928 Act.

69. Accordingly, we are bound to conclude that the 1928 Act was a
treaty in force between Australia and France on 9 May 1973 when
Australia’s Application in the present case was filed. Some months after
the filing of the Application, on 10 January 1974, the French Govern-
ment transmitted to the Secretary-General a notification of its denuncia-
tion of the Act, without prejudice to the position which it had taken
regarding the lack of validity of the Act. Under the settled jurisprudence
of the Court, however, such a notification could not have any retroactive
effect on jurisdiction conferred upon the Court earlier by the filing of the
Application; the Nottebohm case (Preliminary Objection, 1.C.J. Reports
1953, at pp. 120-124). :

70. Nor, in our view, can the conclusion that the 1928 Act was a
treaty in force between Australia and France on 9 May 1973 be in any way
affected by certain action taken with respect to the Act since that date
by two other States, India and the United Kingdom. In the case con-
cerning Trial of Pakistani Prisoners of Warl, by a letter of 24 June 1973
India informed the Court of its view that the 1928 Act had ceased to be a
treaty in force upon the disappearance of the organs of the League of

addressed to the Secretary-General a letter from the Prime Minister of
Pakistan affirming that she considers the Act as continuing in force.
Again, although the United Kingdom, in a letter of 6 February 1974,
referred to doubts having been raised as to the continued legal force of
the Act and notified the Secretary-General of its denunciation of the Act
in conformity with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 45, it did so in
terms which do not prejudge the question of the continuance in force of
the Act. In any event, against these inconclusive elements of State prac-
tice in relation to the 1928 Act which have occurred since the filing of
Australia’s Application, we have to set the many indications of the Act's
continuance in force, some very recent, to which we have already drawn
attention. Moreover, it is axiomatic that the termination of a multilateral
treaty requires the express or tacit consent of all the parties, a requirement
which is manifestly not fulfilled in the present instance.

1 I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 348.


We are therefore clearly of the opinion that Article 17 of the 1928 Act,
in combination with Article 37 of the Statute of the Court, provided

Court on 9 May 1973, subject only to any particular difficulty that might
arise in the application of the Act between Australia and France by
reason of reservations made by either of them. This question we now
proceed to examine.

Applicability of the 1928 Act as Between
Australia and France

71. The French Government has urged in the Annex to its letter of
16 May 1973 that, even if the 1928 Act should be considered as not having
lost its validity, it would still not be applicable as between Australia and
France by reason of two reservations made by Australia to the Act itself
and, in addition, a reservation made by France to its Declaration under
the optional clause of 20 May 1966.

72. The Australian reservations to the 1928 Act here in question are
(1) a clause allowing the temporary suspension of proceedings under the
Act in the case of a dispute that was under consideration by the Council
of the League of Nations and (2) another clause excluding from the scope
of the Act disputes with any State party to the Act but not a member of

said, means that there is now uncertainty as to the scope of these reserva-
tions; and this uncertainty, it is further said, is entirely to the advantage
of Australia and unacceptable.

73. The clause concerning suspension of proceedings was designed
merely to ensure the primacy of the powers of the Council of the League
in the handling of the disputes; and the disappearance of the Council, in
our opinion, left intact the general obligations of pacific settlement
undertaken in the Act itself. Indeed, a similar reservation was contained
in a number of the declarations made under the optional clause of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and there has
never been any doubt that those declarations remained effective notwith-
standing the demise of the Council of the League. Thus, in the Anglo-
Iranian Oil Co. case the declarations of both Parties contained such
a reservation and yet it was never suggested that the demise of the Council
of the League had rendered either of them ineffective. On the contrary,
Iran invoked the reservation, and the United Kingdom contested Iran’s
right to do so only on the ground that the merits of the dispute were not

under consideration by the Security Council (/.C.J. Pleadings, Anglo-
Iranian Oil Co. case, pp. 282 and 367-368). Furthermore, France’s
own accession to the 1928 Act contained a reservation in much the same
terms and yet in the Certain Norwegian Loans case she does not seem to
have regarded this fact as any obstacle to the application of the Act
between herself and Norway.

74. Equally, the disappearance of the League of Nations cannot be
considered as having rendered the general obligations of pacific settlement
embodied in the 1928 Act inapplicable by reason of Australia’s reserva-
tion excluding disputes with States not members of the League. This
Court has not hesitated to apply the term Member of the League of
Nations in connection with the Mandate of South West Africa (/.C.J.
Reports 1950, pp. 138, 158-159 and 169; South West Africa cases, 1.C.J.
Reports 1962, pp. 335-338); nor has the Secretary-General in discharging
his functions as depositary of the League of Nations multilateral treaties
open to participation by States “Members of the League of Nations”.

75. Should any question arise in a case today concerning the applica-
tion of either of the two reservations found in Australia’s accession to the

tion and to appreciate its meaning and effect. Even if the Court were to
hold that one or other reservation was no longer capable of application,
that would not detract from the essential validity of Australia’s accession
to the 1928 Act. Moreover, owing to the well-settled principle of reci-
procity in the application of reservations, any uncertainty that might
exist as to the scope of reservations could not possibly work entirely to
the advantage of Australia. It may be added that France has not suggested
that the present case itself falls within the operation of either reservation.

76. In the light of the foregoing considerations, we are unable to see in
Australia’s reservations any obstacle to the applicability of the 1928 Act
as between her and France.

77. Another and quite different ground is, however, advanced by the
French Government for considering the 1928 Act inapplicable between
France and Australia with respect to the present dispute. The terms of the
declarations of the two countries under the optional clause, it is said,
must be regarded as prevailing over the terms of their accessions to the
1928 Act. In consequence, even on the hypothesis of the validity of the
1928 Act, the reservations in France's declaration of 1966 under the

reservations include the one which excepts from France's acceptance



of jurisdiction under the optional clause “disputes concerning activities
connected with national defence’; and according to the French Govern-
ment that reservation necessarily covers the present dispute regarding
atmospheric nuclear weapon tests conducted by France.

78. One argument advanced in support of that contention is that, the
Statute of the Court being an integral part of the Charter of the United
Nations, the obligations of Members undertaken on the basis of the
optional clause of the Statute must in virtue of Article 103 of the Charter
be regarded as prevailing over their obligations under the 1928 Act. This
argument appears to us to be based on a misconception. The Charter
itself places no obligation on member States to submit their disputes to
judicial settlement, and any such obligation assumed by a Member under
the optional clause of the Statute is therefore undertaken as a voluntary
and additional obligation which does not fall within the purview of
Article 103. The argument is, in any case, self-defeating because it could

the 1928 Act are obligations under Article 36 (1) of the Statute and thus
also obligations under the Charter.

79. The French Government, however, also rests the contention on the
ground that the situation here is analogous to one where there is ‘’a later
treaty relating to the same subject-matter as a treaty concluded earlier in
the relations between the same countries”. In short, according to the
French Government, the declarations of the Parties under the optional
clause are to be considered as equivalent to a later treaty concerning
acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction which, being a later expression of
the wills of the Parties, should prevail over the earlier Act of 1928,
relating to the same subject-matter. In developing this argument, we
should add, the French Government stresses that it does not wish to be
understood as saying that, whenever any treaty contains a clause con-
ferring jurisdiction on the Court, a party may release itself from its
obligations under that clause by an appropriate reservation inserted in a
subsequent declaration under the optional clause. The argument applies
only to the case of a treaty, like the General Act, "the exclusive object of
which is the peaceful settlement of disputes, and in particular judicial
settlement”.

80. This argument appears to us to meet with a number of objections,



not the least of which is the fact that “treaties and conventions in force”
and declarations under the optional clause have always been regarded as
two different sources of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. Jurisdiction
provided for in treaties is covered in paragraph 1 of Article 36 and juris-
diction under declarations accepting the optional clause in paragraph 2;
and the two paragraphs deal with them as quite separate categories. The
paragraphs reproduce corresponding provisions in Article 36 of the
Statute of the Permanent Court, which were adopted to give effect to the
compromise reached between the Council and other Members of the
League on the question of compulsory jurisdiction. The compromise
consisted in the addition, in paragraph 2, of an optional clause allowing
the establishment of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction over legal
disputes between any States ready to accept such an obligation by making
a unilateral declaration to that effect. Thus, the optional clause was from


81. The separate and independent character of the two sources of the
Court’s jurisdiction—treaties and unilateral declarations under the
optional clause—is reflected in the special provisions inserted in the
present Statute for the purpose of preserving the compulsory jurisdiction
attaching to the Permanent Court at the time of its dissolution. Two
different provisions were considered necessary to achieve this purpose:
Article 36 (5) dealing with jurisdiction under the optional clause, and
Article 37 with jurisdiction under “treaties and conventions in force”.
The separate and independent character of the two sources is also reflected
in the jurisprudence of both Courts. The Permanent Court in its Order
refusing provisional measures in the Legal Status of the South-Eastern
Territory of Greenland case and with reference specifically to a clause
in the 1928 Act regarding provisional measures, underlined that a
legal remedy would be available “even independently of the accept-
ance by the Parties of the optional clause” (P.C.I.J., Series A/B,
No. 48, at p. 289). Again, in the Electricity Company of Sofia and
Bulgaria case the Permanent Court held expressly that a bilateral treaty
of conciliation, arbitration and judicial settlement and the Parties’ decla-
rations under the optional clause opened up separate and cumulative

ces of jurisdiction produced a negative result, this did not dispense
the Court from considering “the other source of jurisdiction invoked
separately and independently from the first” (P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No.
77, at pp. 76 and 80). As to this Court, in the Barcelona Traction, Light and
Power Company, Limited case it laid particular emphasis on the fact
that the provisions of Article 37 of the Statute concerning “treaties and
conventions in force” deal with “a different category of instrument” from
the unilateral declarations to which Article 36 (5) relates (/.C.J. Reports
1964, at p. 29). More recently, in the Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
of the ICAO Council case the Court based one of its conclusions specifi-



cally on the independent and autonomous character of these two sources
of its jurisdiction (I.C.J. Reports 1972, at pp. 53 and 60).

82. In the present instance, this objection is reinforced by the fact that
the 1928 Act contains a strict code of rules regulating the making of
reservations, whereas no such rules govern the making of reservations to
acceptances of the Court’s jurisdiction under the optional clause. These

impose restrictions, inter alia, on the kinds of reservations that are ad-
missible and the times at which they may be made and at which they will
take effect. In addition, a State accepting jurisdiction under the optional
clause may fix for itself the period for which its declaration is to run and
may even make it terminable at any time by giving notice, whereas
Article 45 (1) of the Act prescribes that the Act is to remain in force for
successive fixed periods of five years unless denounced at least six months
before the expiry of the current period. That the framers of the 1928 Act
deliberately differentiated its régime in regard to reservations from that of
the optional clause is clear; for the Assembly of the League, when
adopting the Act, simultaneously in another resolution drew the attention
of States to the wide possibilities of limiting the extent of commitments
under the optional clause “both as regards duration and as regards
scope”. Consequently, to admit that reservations made by a State under
the uncontrolled and extremely flexible system of the optional clause may
automatically modify the conditions under which it accepted jurisdiction
under the 1928 Act would run directly counter to the strict system of
reservations deliberately provided for in the Act.

83. The French Government evidently feels the force of that objection;

the Act, which requires any changes in reservations to be notified at least
six months before the end of the current five-year period of the Act’s
duration, by treating France’s reservations made in her 1966 declaration
as having taken effect only at the end of the then current period, namely
in September 1969. This suggestion appears, however, to disregard the
essential nature of a reservation. A reservation, as Article 2, paragraph 1
(d), of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties records, is:

““... a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a
State, when signing, ratifving, accepting, approving or acceding to a
treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect


of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State’.

Thus, in principle, a reservation relates exclusively to a State’s expression
of consent to be bound by a particular treaty or instrument and to the
obligations assumed by that expression of consent. Consequently, the
notion that a reservation attached to one international agreement, by
some unspecified process, is to be superimposed upon or transferred to

tion in international law; and also cuts across the rules governing the
notification, acceptance and rejection of reservations. The mere fact that
it never seems to have occurred to the Secretary-General of the League or
of the United Nations that reservations made in declarations under the
optional clause are of any concern whatever to parties to the General
Act shows how novel is this suggestion.

84. The novelty is further underlined by the fact that, whenever States
have desired to establish a link between reservations to jurisdiction under
the optional clause and jurisdiction under a treaty, this has been done by

Treaty of 17 March 1948 agreed in Article VIII to refer to the Court all
disputes falling within the scope of the optional clause subject only, in the
case of each of them, to any reservation already made by that party when
accepting that clause. Even in that treaty, we observe, the parties envis-
aged the application to jurisdiction under the treaty only of optional
clause reservations “already made”. Article 35, paragraph 4, of the
European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes goes
further in that it empowers a party at any time, by simple declaration, to
make the same reservations to the Convention as it may make to the
optional clause. But under this Article a specific declaration, made with
