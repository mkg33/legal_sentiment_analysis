                       Although I have voted in favour of all the conclusions reached by
                    the Court, there are two issues on which I wish to offer some observa-
                    tions.


                                                      I. Jurisdiction

                       1. The first issue concerns the jurisdiction of the Court in this case. In
                    its Judgment rendered on 17 March 2016, the Court found
                          “that it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article XXXI of the Pact of
                          Bogotá, to adjudicate upon the dispute between the Republic of Nica-
                          ragua and the Republic of Colombia referred to in subparagraph 1 (b)
                          above [i.e. the ‘dispute regarding the alleged violations by Colombia of
                          Nicaragua’s rights in the maritime zones which, according to Nicaragua,
                          the Court declared in its 2012 Judgment appertain to Nicaragua’]” 1.
                       2. In the resumed proceedings on the merits, Colombia subsequently
                    argued that “the Court lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis to consider any
                    claims that are based on events that are alleged to have transpired after
                    Colombia ceased to be bound by the provisions of the Pact” 2, that is,
                    after 26 November 2013. According to the Respondent, Article XXXI,

                       1 Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea

                       2 Counter‑Memorial of the Republic of Colombia, para. 1.15. The argument has

                    been further elaborated in paragraphs 4.19‑4.21 of the Counter‑Memorial, in para-
                    graphs 3.6‑3.36 of the Rejoinder of the Republic of Colombia and during the hearings
                    (see CR 2021/15, pp. 14‑18, paras. 31‑46 (Bundy) and CR 2021/18, pp. 32‑35, paras. 18‑33
                    (Bundy)).

                    read together with Article LVI of the Pact, provides for “a clear temporal
                    limitation to Colombia’s consent to the Court’s jurisdiction over a dis-
                    pute concerning the existence of any fact which, if established, could con-
                    stitute the breach of an international obligation” 3. Therefore, in
                    Colombia’s view, “no jurisdictional basis exists for the Court to rule on
                    any of the facts alleged to have occurred after the Pact ceased to be in
                    effect for Colombia” 4.

                      3. It has, however, to be emphasized that Colombia did not include
                    this argument in its final submissions — not in its Counter‑Memorial or
                    Rejoinder, nor at the end of the oral proceedings. The Court nevertheless
                    considered it necessary to rule on this argument in the operative clause of
                    the present Judgment (para. 261 (1)).

                       4. Article XXXI of the Pact has to be interpreted according to the cus-
                    tomary rules on treaty interpretation which, as the Court has repeatedly
                    stated, are reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on
                    the Law of Treaties 5.
                       5. Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá provides:
                                 “In conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
                             International Court of Justice, the High Contracting Parties declare
                             that they recognize in relation to any other American State, the
                             jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory ipso facto, without the
                             ­
                             ­necessity of any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in
                              force, in all disputes of a juridical nature that arise among them
                              ­concerning:
                             (a) The interpretation of a treaty;
                             (b) Any question of international law;
                             (c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
                                  the breach of an international obligation;
                             (d) The nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach
                                  of an international obligation.”
                      6. Denunciation of the Pact of Bogotá is governed by Article LVI,
                    which reads:
                                “The present Treaty shall remain in force indefinitely, but may be
                             denounced upon one year’s notice, at the end of which period it shall
                             cease to be in force with respect to the State denouncing it, but shall
                             continue in force for the remaining signatories. The denunciation
                             shall be addressed to the Pan American Union, which shall transmit
                             it to the other Contracting Parties.

                            The denunciation shall have no effect with respect to pending pro­
                          cedures initiated prior to the transmission of the particular notification.”
                       7. Before interpreting Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá, it may be
                    useful, as a preliminary matter, to make two observations. First, it is
                    noteworthy that Article XXXI of the Pact is modelled on the text of Arti-
                    cle 36, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute. One key difference between
                    the two provisions is that instead of providing an acceptance of jurisdic-
                    tion by each State party to the Statute individually by way of a declara-
                    tion, Article XXXI creates jurisdiction between the American States
                    which are parties to the Pact. As the Court has previously observed, Arti-
                    cle XXXI of the Pact is an “autonomous” basis of jurisdiction, distinct
                    from Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute 6. It is a treaty provi-
                    sion conferring jurisdiction upon the Court in accordance with Article 36,

                       8. Second, an important conceptual distinction has to be made between
                    the validity in time of a title of jurisdiction on the one hand, and on the
                    other hand, the temporal scope of jurisdiction conferred by the title of
                    jurisdiction, that is, a temporal limitation attached to the title excluding,
                    for example, disputes arising prior to a certain date 7. At risk of stating
                    the obvious, there must exist a valid title of jurisdiction between the par-
                    ties at the date of the institution of proceedings for the Court to have
                    jurisdiction over a dispute in the first place 8. The title invoked must be in
                    force; this goes to the validity in time of a title of jurisdiction. The Court
                    must then ascertain whether the title of jurisdiction provides for any tem-
                    poral conditions, and if so whether the dispute comes within the temporal
                    scope of the title. In this sense, temporal conditions are an element of the
                    definition of the class of disputes to which consent extends 9. They go to
                    the Court’s jurisdiction itself; they do not go to the validity in time of the
                    title of jurisdiction, which is a distinct, separate issue.

                       9. Once this distinction between validity in time of a title of jurisdic-
                    tion and temporal conditions in the title of jurisdiction is appreciated, it
                    becomes clear that Colombia’s interpretation cannot be accepted. Inter-
                    preting Article XXXI as a whole, in its context and in light of the object
                    and purpose of the Pact, it must be concluded that Article XXXI does not
                    contain any temporal condition or limitation.
                       10. The phrase “so long as the present Treaty is in force” does not, in
                    its plain meaning, suggest any temporal condition as to the disputes over
                    which the Court has jurisdiction. This is not the purpose of this phrase.
                    The phrase simply concerns the validity in time of the title of jurisdiction.
                    It specifies that a State party to the Pact recognizes the jurisdiction of the
                    Court without the necessity of any special agreement so long as it remains
                    a party to it. The consent of a State to the Court’s jurisdiction remains
                    valid from the moment it becomes a party to the Pact of Bogotá until the
                    moment it ceases to be a party thereto. Thus, a Contracting Party to the
                    Pact may institute proceedings against any other Contracting Party “so
                    long as the . . . Treaty is in force” between them. I do not share the
                    Court’s view that the phrase “so long as the present Treaty is in force” in
                    Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá “limits the period within which such
                    a dispute must have arisen” (Judgment, para. 40). Certainly, a dispute
                    must, according to the Court’s well‑established jurisprudence, exist at
                    the moment of filing the application instituting the proceedings and the
                    applicant may validly institute proceedings only when the title of jurisdic-
                    tion invoked is in force. But the phrase in question does not limit
                    the period within which the dispute must have arisen, as the Court opines.
                    In fact, a dispute may have arisen even before the Pact of Bogotá has
                    entered into force in relations between the parties to a dispute. Such dis-
                    pute may be brought before the Court if, subsequent to the dispute’s
                    emergence, the Pact of Bogotá has entered into force as between the dis-
                    puting parties 10.

                        11. The phrases “[a]ny question of international law” and “[t]he
                    e­xistence of any fact which, if established, would constitute the breach
                     of an international obligation” found in Article XXXI, subparagraphs (b)
                     and (c), of the Pact do not point to a different conclusion. These phrases
                     in their ordinary meaning do not intimate any temporal condition as
                     to the disputes over which the Court has jurisdiction. I agree with
                     the Court’s Judgment that the categories listed in Article XXXI concern
                    the subject‑matter of the disputes (ibid., para. 40). This observation is
                    consistent with the Court’s interpretation of Article XXXI of the
                        10 The best example is a dispute brought before the Court by Bolivia on 24 April 2013

                    against Chile. Chile ratified the Pact of Bogotá on 15 April 1974 while Bolivia did so only
                    on 9 June 2011. The dispute between them had arisen several decades earlier. See Obliga‑
                    tion to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile), Preliminary Objection,
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), p. 601, para. 21, as well as the Judgment on the merits
                    in the same case, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (II), pp. 518‑538, paras. 19‑83.

                       12. Article LVI likewise says nothing about the scope of the Court’s
                    jurisdiction over a dispute brought to it on the basis of Article XXXI.
                    That provision governs denunciation 12. The Pact of Bogotá, once ratified
                    or acceded to by an American State, continues in force indefinitely in
                    relation to that State, and may be denounced only by giving one year’s
                    notice, remaining in force during all that period.

                       13. Colombia’s interpretation, moreover, runs counter to the context
                    of Article XXXI. Several provisions of the Pact are aimed at restricting
                    the scope of the parties’ commitment, notably Article V, Article VI and
                    Article VII. In addition, Article LV of the Pact of Bogotá allows the par-
                    ties to make reservations to that instrument which “shall, with respect to
                    the State that makes them, apply to all signatory States on the basis of
                    reciprocity”. These provisions, taken together, tend to indicate that tem-
                    poral limitations to the Court’s jurisdiction under the Pact can only be
                    introduced by means of reservations to it.

                    dealing with Colombia’s arguments, the Court refers to its jurisprudence
                    on two distinct issues, namely on new facts and new claims. In my view,

                    the Court’s jurisprudence on new claims is not pertinent to the present
                    case, for the simple reason that Nicaragua has not formulated any new
                    claim; it has merely referred to additional facts in support of its original
                    claim. In other words, it has provided detailed particulars of further
                    ­incidents substantiating its original claim. It suffices to look at Nicara-
                     gua’s submissions. Thus, in its Application, Nicaragua requested the
                     Court to adjudge and declare that Colombia is in breach of “its obliga-
                     tion not to violate Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited in para-
                     graph 251 of the ICJ Judgment of 19 November 2012 as well as
                     Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones” (Applica-
                     tion, p. 24, para. 22).

                         16. In its Memorial, it requested the Court to adjudge and declare that,
                           “[by its conduct, the Republic of Colombia has breached] its obliga-
                           tion not to violate Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited in para-
                           graph 251 of the Court Judgment of 19 November 2012 as well as
                           Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones” (Memo-
                           rial of Nicaragua, p. 107, para. 1 (a)).

                         17. And in its Reply, it asked the Court to adjudge and declare that,

                           “[b]y its conduct, the Republic of Colombia has breached its interna-
                           tional obligation to respect Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delim-
                           ited in paragraph 251 of the Court Judgment of 19 November 2012
                           as well as Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones”
                           (Reply of Nicaragua, p. 191, para. 1 (a)).
                      18. Finally, in its final submissions, Nicaragua requested the Court to
                    adjudge and declare that
                           “[b]y its conduct, the Republic of Colombia has breached its interna-
                           tional obligation to respect Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited
                           in paragraph 251 of the Court Judgment of 19 November 2012, as
                           well as Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones”
                           (CR 2021/17, p. 50, para. 1 (a) (Argüello Gómez)).

                       19. Nicaragua has not modified its original claim, which has remained
                    virtually the same throughout the proceedings. Thus, the Court’s juris-
                    prudence on new claims (whether based on facts subsequent to the appli-
                    cation or not) is not pertinent in the present case. Rather, it must be
                    asked whether reliance on detailed particulars of further incidents sub-
                    stantiating Nicaragua’s original claim “transform[s] the nature of the dis-
                    pute”. In its Application, Nicaragua referred to some 13 incidents. By
                    subsequently referring to 38 post‑Application incidents, it has not, in my
                    view, transformed the dispute or its character.

                           tion correspond to the finding of the Court that,

                              ‘whilst under Article 40 of its Statute the subject of a dispute
                              brought before the Court shall be indicated, Article 32 (2) of the
                              Rules of Court [today Article 38, paragraph 2] requires the Appli-
                              cant ‘as far as possible’ to do certain things. These words apply
                              not only to specifying the provision on which the Applicant
                              founds the jurisdiction of the Court, but also to stating the precise
                              nature of the claim and giving a succinct statement of the facts
                              and grounds on which the claim is based.’ (Northern Cameroons
                              (Cameroon v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objections, Judg‑
                              ment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 28.)” 18

                         22. And the Court recalled that
                           “it has become an established practice for States submitting an appli-
                           cation to the Court to reserve the right to present additional facts and
                           legal considerations. The limit of the freedom to present such facts
                           and considerations is ‘that the result is not to transform the dispute
                           brought before the Court by the application into another dispute
                           which is different in character’ (Military and Paramilitary Activities

                    recall that the parties to a case cannot in the course of proceedings “trans-
                    form the dispute brought before the Court into a dispute that would be of
                    a different nature” 22. The Court was of the view that

                          “the United States ha[d] not, by [providing detailed particulars of
                          further incidents substantiating its original claim], transformed the
                          subject of the dispute originally submitted to the Court, nor ha[d] it
                          modified the substance of its counter‑claim, which remain[ed] the
                          same, i.e., alleged attacks by Iran on shipping, laying of mines and
                          other military actions said to be ‘dangerous and detrimental to mari­
                          time commerce’, thus breaching Iran’s obligations to the United States
                          under Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty” 23.

                      27. There is, however, still one question to be answered, namely,
                    whether the conclusion just reached is altered in any way by the fact that
                    the incidents occurred after the date on which the Pact of Bogotá ceased
                    to be in force for Colombia. Nicaragua has relied in support of its origi-
                    nal claim as formulated in its Application on incidents that occurred not
