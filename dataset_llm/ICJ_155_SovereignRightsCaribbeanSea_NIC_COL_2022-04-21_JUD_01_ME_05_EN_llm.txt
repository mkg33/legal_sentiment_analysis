                       First disagreement with conclusion on jurisdiction ratione temporis —
                    Jurisdiction based on consent of the parties and subject to limits and conditions
                    thereto — Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá establishes those limits — No
                    detailed interpretation of Article XXXI of the Pact is undertaken — Such
                    interpretation would lead to conclusion that Court lacks jurisdiction over claims
                    predicated on facts and events having occurred after lapse of jurisdictional title —
                    Nothing in 2016 Judgment suggests that Court’s jurisdiction extends to events
                    subsequent to termination of the Pact with respect to Colombia — An analogy
                    with jurisprudence on admissibility of new claims subsequent to application whilst
                    jurisdictional title still in force is inapposite — Also, alleged incidents are not of
                    “same nature” — They are neither uniform in character nor always relate to
                    identical facts or common legal bases — Second disagreement with subparagraph 6
                    of dispositif referring to provisions of Presidential Decree 1946 of 9 September
                    2013 — Inconsistency with subparagraph 5 of dispositif, which finds Colombia’s
                    “integral contiguous zone”, rather than Presidential Decree 1946 itself, as not in
                    conformity with customary law — Inconsistency also found in reasoning of
                    Judgment.

                       1. I voted against several subparagraphs of the dispositif because of my
                    disagreement with two conclusions of the Court in this Judgment. The
                    first one concerns the jurisdiction ratione temporis of the Court, while
                    the second relates to the conformity with customary international law of
                    the provisions of the Colombian Presidential Decree 1946 of 9 September
                    2013. The reasons for my disagreement are set out below.

                                A. Jurisdiction of the Court Ratione Temporis

                      2. I disagree with the conclusion in subparagraph 1 of the dispositif of
                    the Judgment, according to which the Court’s jurisdiction on the basis of
                    Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá extends to the “claims based on those
                    events referred to by the Republic of Nicaragua that occurred after
                    27 November 2013”, the date on which the Pact of Bogotá ceased to be in
                    force with respect to the Republic of Colombia.
                      3. The jurisdiction of the Court is based on the consent of the parties.
                    Such consent may also be subject to certain conditions and/or limits
                    which must be observed by the Court. As was stated by the Court in its
                    Judgment on Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Appli‑
                    cation: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), “[w]hen
                    that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international

                    agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must be
                    regarded as constituting the limits thereon” 1.
                       4. Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá is such a compromissory clause.
                    It reads as follows:
                             “In conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
                          International Court of Justice, the High Contracting Parties declare
                          that they recognize in relation to any other American State, the juris-
                          diction of the Court as compulsory ipso facto, without the necessity
                          of any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in force, in
                          all disputes of a juridical nature that arise among them concerning:
                          (a) The interpretation of a treaty; (b) Any question of international
                          law; (c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
                          the breach of an international obligation; (d) The nature or extent of
                          the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obliga-
                          tion.” (Emphases added.)
                       5. It is no longer disputed between the Parties to the instant case that
                    the lapse of the jurisdictional title after the filing of the Application does
                    not affect the jurisdiction of the Court to adjudicate their “dispute” over
                    facts that are said to have occurred before the jurisdictional title came to
                    an end 2. What is, however, disputed between them and on which divergent
                    arguments have been presented during the current proceedings is whether
                    the lapse of the jurisdictional title had an effect on the Court’s jurisdiction
                    to examine claims regarding incidents that have allegedly occurred after
                    the Pact of Bogotá ceased to be in force between the Parties, i.e. the inci-
                    dents that are said to have occurred after 27 November 2013.
                       6. The Court has never been confronted with a similar situation.
                    Therefore, neither the findings in the Court’s Judgment of 2016 3 nor the
                    Court’s jurisprudence with respect to the admissibility of facts or claims
                    that occurred after the filing of the Application, but while the title of
                    jurisdiction still existed, can offer a solution to this divergence of views. It
                    was therefore necessary, in my view, to proceed in the Judgment to a
                    detailed analysis of the interpretation of Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá,
                    which provides the limits and conditions of the Court’s jurisdiction. It is
                    regrettable that such an analysis is nowhere to be found in the Judgment.
                       7. Such an interpretation, in my view, would readily lead to the conclu-
                    sion that the Court does not have jurisdiction over claims predicated on
                    facts and events that occurred after the lapse of the jurisdictional title

                    between the Parties. By specifying that the Parties to the Pact of Bogotá
                    recognize the jurisdiction of the Court over disputes concerning “any fact
                    which, if established, would constitute the breach of an international obli-
                    gation” only “so long as the present Treaty is in force”, the text of Arti-
                    cle XXXI makes it abundantly clear that the Court’s jurisdiction
                    ratione temporis is limited to facts underlying a dispute which occurred
                    before the Pact ceased to apply. The consent expressed in Article XXXI
                    does not and cannot extend to events or facts underlying disputes that
                    occurred after the treaty had lapsed. In this regard, Article XXXI of the
                    Pact sets out a clear temporal limitation to the Court’s jurisdiction in so
                    far as consent is conditioned on the continuation in force of the Pact
                    between the concerned States.

                      8. This textual interpretation of Article XXXI finds support in the
                    Court’s analysis of this provision in the Border and Transborder Armed
                    Actions case, where it was stated that,

                          “[i]n that text, the parties ‘declare that they recognize’ the Court’s
                          jurisdiction ‘as compulsory ipso facto’ in the cases there enumerated.
                          �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                              The commitment in Article XXXI applies ratione materiae to the
                          disputes enumerated in that text; it relates ratione personae to the Amer-
                          ican States parties to the Pact; it remains valid ratione temporis for as
                          long as that instrument itself remains in force between those States.” 4
                      9. Moreover, the words “so long as the present Treaty is in force” in
                    Article XXXI must be read together with the first sentence of Article LVI
                    of the Pact, which states that
                          “[t]he present Treaty shall remain in force indefinitely, but may be
                          denounced upon one year’s notice, at the end of which period it shall
                          cease to be in force with respect to the State denouncing it, but shall
                          continue in force for the remaining signatories”.
                    The Pact of Bogotá ceased to be in force for Colombia on 27 November
                    2013, that is one year after Colombia gave its notice of denunciation.
                    Thus, under the terms of Article XXXI, there is no basis for the Court to
                    entertain any claims relating to events or situations that occurred after
                    that date and that might have given rise to a dispute between the Parties
                    or to conclude that it has jurisdiction over such claims, in view of the
                    termination of the Pact of Bogotá between the two States.

                       10. The “dispute” found by the Court to exist in its 2016 Judgment was
                    limited to the facts “at the date on which the Application was filed”, i.e.
                    before the lapse of the jurisdictional title. The Court was careful to limit

                    itself to a finding of jurisdiction over the dispute concerning “the incidents
                    at sea alleged to have taken place before the critical date” 5. At no point in
                    the 2016 Judgment did the Court define the “dispute” by reference to inci-
                    dents at sea that took place after the filing of the Application. This is
                    despite the fact that the Court already had before it Nicaragua’s Memo-
                    rial, which contained no less than 20 incidents allegedly having occurred in
                    the period between the Application and the Memorial.
                       11. Accordingly, the Court concluded that,
                          “[b]ased on the evidence examined above, the Court finds that, at the
                          date on which the Application was filed, there existed a dispute con-
                          cerning the alleged violations by Colombia of Nicaragua’s rights in
                          the maritime zones which, according to Nicaragua, the Court declared
                          in its 2012 Judgment appertain to Nicaragua” 6.
                     Thus, contrary to what is mentioned in paragraph 45 of the Judgment,
                     there is nothing in the 2016 Judgment to suggest that the Court’s jurisdic-
                    tion extends to facts subsequent to the Application and subsequent to the
                    termination of the Pact of Bogotá with respect to Colombia.
                        12. It is also untenable to draw an analogy between the Court’s juris-
                    prudence on the admissibility of new “claims” or “facts” that occurred
                    after the filing of an application, but while the title of jurisdiction contin-
                    ued to exist, and the present case, which concerns the Court’s jurisdiction
                    ­vis-à-vis new facts or events after the lapse of the jurisdictional title. The
                     criteria enunciated in the Court’s case law with respect to the admissibil-
                     ity of new claims, while the jurisdictional title continues to be in force,
                     cannot apply to the determination of the Court’s jurisdiction ratione tem‑
                    poris. According to such case law, the admissibility of new claims presup-
                    poses the continued existence of a valid jurisdictional title, which is not
                    the case here. Therefore, none of the cases mentioned in paragraph 44 of
                    the Judgment are apposite to the present circumstances, as the jurisdic-
                    tional title invoked by the respective applicant continued to be in force
                    throughout the proceedings. Moreover, it should be recalled that in all
                    those cases, the problem was one of admissibility, not of jurisdiction ratione
                    temporis.

                      13. It is equally important to note that the incidents that have allegedly
                    occurred before and after 27 November 2013 are neither uniform in
                    chara­cter nor do they always relate to identical facts or common legal
                    bases. They cannot therefore be characterized to be of “the same nature”;
                    nor can it be said that they concern the same legal questions. To give a
                    simple example, no incident concerning marine scientific research occurred
                    before 27 November 2013. The two incidents on marine scientific research

                    regarding the Dr Jorge Carranza Fraser allegedly occurred on 6 and
                    8 October 2018. In addition, the three incidents concerning the USA-­
                    flagged oceanographic vessel Pathfinder are said to have occurred on
                    7 and 25 January 2014 and 20 February 2014, respectively.

                        14. Are such alleged incidents regarding marine scientific research of
                    the same nature as incidents regarding fishing or overflight that occurred
                    before 27 November 2013? The answer is negative. Apart from the differ-
                    ence in character of these incidents, the legal bases of the claims relating
                    to them are dissimilar. While the coastal State has sovereign rights in the
                    exclusive economic zone (hereinafter the “EEZ”) with respect to fisheries,
                    it has jurisdiction with regard to marine scientific research. Thus, the legal
                    régime governing the rights and obligations of the two States with respect
                    to the two sets of alleged incidents in the EEZ is quite different.
                    ­Consequently, the dispute between the Parties over the alleged incidents
                     before and after 27 November 2013 does not always have the same
                     ­subject-­matter nor does it concern the same facts or situations or the
                      same legal questions, but has a varied number of aspects both legally and
                      factually.

                                      B. Subparagraph 6 of the Dispositif

                       15. I also have to express my disagreement with subparagraph 6 of the
                    dispositif, which states that
                          “Colombia must, by means of its own choosing, bring into conform-
                          ity with customary international law the provisions of Presidential
                          Decree 1946 of 9 September 2013, as amended by Decree No. 1119
                          of 17 June 2014, in so far as they relate to maritime areas declared by
                          the Court in its 2012 Judgment to appertain to the Republic of Nic-
                          aragua”.
                       16. By ordering Colombia to bring the provisions of the Presidential
                    Decree into conformity with customary international law, the Court is
                    clearly barking up the wrong tree. It is not solely by enacting the provi-
                    sions of the Presidential Decree as such, but through their implementa-
                    tion in establishing the “integral contiguous zone” and enforcing its
                    powers therein that Colombia has breached the rights of Nicaragua in the
                    latter’s EEZ. After all, the Judgment itself does not say anywhere that
                    Colombia has breached its obligations under customary international law
                    by merely enacting the Presidential Decree or that it is the Decree, in and
                    of itself, which is not in conformity with international law. It finds that it
                    is the “integral contiguous zone” established by Colombia that is not in
                    conformity with customary international law (see, for example, para-
                    graphs 187 and 194 of the Judgment). This finding is afterwards reflected
                    in subparagraph 5 of the dispositif.

                       17. However, instead of stating in subparagraph 6 of the dispositif that
                    Colombia should bring the limits of its “integral contiguous zone” and
                    the powers it exercises therein into conformity with customary interna-
                    tional law, the Judgment pivots, under this subparagraph, to the necessity
                    of bringing the provisions of the Presidential Decree into conformity with
                    customary international law. To the extent that subparagraph 5 of the
                    dispositif makes a finding concerning the incompatibility with customary
                    law of a particular zone, rather than the legislative or administrative
                    means underlying its implementation, the obligation to remedy that situ-
                    ation cannot be limited to the provisions of a particular decree or piece of
                    legislation. Rather, it should concern the “integral contiguous zone”
                    itself, its limits, and the police powers exercised in it by Colombia over
                    environmental and other matters, to the detriment of the sovereign rights
                    and jurisdiction of Nicaragua in its EEZ.
                       18. It is for these reasons that I voted in favour of the finding in sub-
                    paragraph 5 of the dispositif, but against subparagraph 6 thereof. In my
                    view, the latter clause is not consistent with the conclusions of the Court
                    reflected in subparagraph 5 of the dispositif, which finds that it is the
                    “‘integral contiguous zone’ established by the Republic of Colombia by
                    Presidential Decree 1946 of 9 September 2013, as amended by Decree 1119
                    of 17 June 2014” — and not the Presidential Decree 1946 itself — which
                    is not in conformity with customary international law.
                       19. This inconsistency is to be found also in the reasoning of the Judg-
                    ment itself. In paragraph 196 of the Judgment, which is meant to sum-
                    marize the infringements by Colombia through its “integral contiguous
                    zone” of Nicaragua’s rights in the latter’s EEZ, it is stated that
                          “[t]he Court has also found (see paragraphs 187 and 194 above) that
                          the ‘integral contiguous zone’ established by Colombia’s Presidential
                          Decree 1946 is not in conformity with customary international law,
                          both because its breadth exceeds 24 nautical miles from the baselines
                          from which Colombia’s territorial sea is measured and because the
                          powers that Colombia asserts within the ‘integral contiguous zone’
                          exceed those that are permitted under customary international law.
                          In the maritime areas where the ‘integral contiguous zone’ overlaps
                          with Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone, the ‘integral contiguous
                          zone’ infringes upon Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in
                          the exclusive economic zone. Colombia’s responsibility is thereby
                          engaged. Colombia has the obligation, by means of its own choosing,
                          to bring the provisions of Presidential Decree 1946 into conformity
                          with customary international law in so far as they relate to maritime
                          areas declared by the Court in its 2012 Judgment to appertain to
                          Nicaragua.”
                      20. Based on this paragraph, it is not clear whether it is the zone itself,
                    the enforcement of its limits and the powers exercised by Colombia
                    therein, or solely the legislative means underlying it, i.e. the Presidential
                    Decree as such, that is found to be incompatible with customary interna-





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 276                                                                              10/09/23 09:40

                    403 	 sovereign rights and maritime spaces (sep. op. yusuf)

                    tional law. Paragraph 175 also states that it is “[t]he geographical extent
                    of the ‘integral contiguous zone’” — rather than Article 5 of Presidential
                    Decree 1946 — which “is not in conformity with customary international
                    law”. By contrast, paragraphs 176 to 180 specifically examine the com-
                    patibility of Article 5, paragraph 3, of Presidential Decree 1946 with cus-
                    tomary law. All these inconsistencies lead to confusion, which is
                    regrettably reflected in the above subparagraphs of the dispositif.

                       21. If the findings of the Judgment relate to the incompatibility of the
                    “integral contiguous zone” itself with customary international law, as
                    appears to be indicated in several paragraphs of the Judgment and in
                    subparagraph 5 of the dispositif, then the obligation to bring the situation
                    into conformity with customary international law should logically relate
                    to the “integral contiguous zone”, and the powers exercised therein by
                    Colombia, rather than the provisions of the Presidential Decree as such,
                    as currently formulated in subparagraph 6 of the dispositif.
