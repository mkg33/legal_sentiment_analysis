     2. In my view, the United States has not violated Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of
Amity.


       3. According to the Court’s 2019 Judgment on preliminary objections, “an entity may only be
characterized as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty if it has its own legal personality,
conferred on it by the law of the State where it was created, which establishes its legal status” 1. By
using the phrase “its own legal personality”, the Court did not address, much less resolve, the
question whether Article III, paragraph 1, merely protects the legal existence of a company or
whether it also protects the separate legal personality of companies which possess such a personality
by virtue of the domestic law under which they were established. This phrase does not imply, contrary
to what paragraph 136 of the present Judgment affirms, that “[t]he recognition of a company’s own
legal personality entails the legal existence of the company as an entity that is distinct from other
natural or legal persons, including States”. A closer analysis in fact reveals that Article III,
paragraph 1, does not protect any legally distinct (separate) existence of companies.


        4. The ordinary meaning of the terms contained in the first sentence of Article III, paragraph 1,
(“shall have their juridical status recognized”) is open to several interpretations. “[T]heir juridical
status” may mean the juridical status of companies as under the applicable law of either High
Contracting Party, as Iran claims 2, but it may also mean their juridical status as entities which are
legally existent, as the United States claims 3. The second sentence of Article III, paragraph 1, makes
clear that the “juridical status” of companies, as determined by the applicable law of the respective
High Contracting Party, “does not of itself confer rights upon companies to engage in the activities
for which they are organized”. Thus, if the legal status of a company allows that company to engage
in certain activities in the territory of the State party under whose laws it is constituted, the
implications of that legal status need not be recognized by the other party for such activities within
its own territory. Here again, the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article III, paragraph 1, is open
to several interpretations. The legal separateness of a company can be regarded as a defining element
of its “juridical status”, but also as a right enabling the company to engage in activities for which the
limited liability of its associates or shareholders is essential.


      5. The context of Article III, paragraph 1, consists, first and foremost, in the fact that it
precedes, and leads to, Article III, paragraph 2. That provision guarantees companies’ freedom of
access to courts “both in defense and pursuit of their rights”. To be able to exercise this freedom, it
is necessary, but also sufficient, for a company to be legally existent. If Article III, paragraph 1,
guaranteed the separate legal personality of companies, in addition to their legal existence, it would
be guaranteeing a right that is unrelated to Article III, paragraph 2. This element of the context

suggests that Article III, paragraph 1, guarantees only the “juridical status” of companies in so far as
this is necessary to safeguard the right of access to courts (Article III, paragraph 2).


       6. A restrictive interpretation of Article III, paragraph 1, as guaranteeing only the legal
existence of companies (mainly for the purpose of claiming their rights before courts), would not
leave unprotected the separate legal personality of companies which possess such a personality. In
my view, such protection rather derives from Article IV, paragraph 1 — the fair and equitable
treatment clause — which is another element of the context of Article III, paragraph 1. Article IV,
paragraph 1, provides protection, in an appropriately balanced way, against an unreasonable
disregard of any separate legal personality as well as the possibility for States parties to engage in
regulation, including reasonable forms of lifting the corporate veil. Indeed, a guarantee of legal
separateness has a different character than a mere guarantee of legal existence, because it must be
open to certain exceptions 4. Many domestic legal orders treat the rules on legal personality and the
rules on liability separately, and a variety of corporate forms establish legal personality in respect of
which associates or shareholders remain fully liable for the activities of these legal persons. Different
domestic legal orders also provide a variety of rules relating to the conditions under which any
separate legal personality of companies may be disregarded 5. Against this background, it appears
counter-intuitive to assume that the parties to the Treaty of Amity envisaged that Article III,
paragraph 1, would guarantee the separate legal existence of companies without at least hinting at
possible exceptions. Article IV, paragraph 1, provides a more appropriate standard for the protection
of the separate legal personality of companies because it leaves room for generally recognized
exceptions.


       7. The object and purpose of the Treaty of Amity, which is to facilitate and increase commerce
between the two States, does not require that Article III, paragraph 1, be interpreted as guaranteeing
the separate legal personality of companies involved in such commerce. Rather, it is sufficient that
Article III, paragraph 1, ensures that companies can enter into legal obligations and invoke
substantive and procedural rights before domestic courts without the need to prove that they meet
requirements other than those resulting from the domestic law under which they were established.
An additional protection of any separate legal status would go beyond the guarantee that companies
be treated on an equal basis with other companies under the law of the State party in whose territory
they operate. The object and purpose of the Treaty is rather appropriately furthered by a balanced
protection of any separate legal personality under Article IV, paragraph 1.


      8. The travaux préparatoires confirm a restrictive interpretation. An aide-memoire by the
US Embassy in Tehran, dated 20 November 1954, according to which Article III, paragraph 1,
provides for the “recognition as corporate entities”, suggests that this provision primarily serves to
recognize the company as a legal entity for the purposes of asserting or defending claims in a judicial


                                                          -3-

borders, such as the location of its seat, the nationality of its ownership, or the character of its aims”,
and that the purpose of Article III, paragraph 1, was to abolish such requirements and to recognize
the legal existence of a company that was established under the domestic law of the other party 7. The
documents submitted by the United States, which have also been referred to by Iran, suggest that
Article III, paragraph 1, was only intended to allow corporate entities to enter into legal rights and
obligations within the territory of the other State (“legal capacity”) and to have standing before the
domestic courts. There are no indications in the documents that the parties wanted to go further and
to provide protection against any form of lifting of the corporate veil.


       9. For all these reasons, I consider that the protection afforded by Article III, paragraph 1, is
narrow, and limited to the recognition of the legal existence of a company. In contrast to Article IV,
paragraph 1 (see paragraph 6 above), this provision does not include a broader guarantee of the
separate legal existence of companies. Therefore, the United States has, in my view, not violated
Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity. This conclusion does not, however, affect the finding
of the Court, with which I agree, that the disregard by the United States of the separate legal
personality of certain Iranian companies violated Article IV, paragraph 1, of the Treaty.

      10. The Court’s determination, in the present Judgment (para. 54), that Bank Markazi is not a
“company” within the meaning of the Treaty of Amity is in line with its 2019 Judgment on
preliminary objections. In that Judgment, the Court explained that “an entity carrying out exclusively
sovereign activities, linked to the sovereign functions of the State, cannot be characterized as a
‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty” 8. At the same time, the Court held that

        “there is nothing to preclude, a priori, a single entity from engaging both in activities
        of a commercial nature (or, more broadly, business activities) and in sovereign
        activities.

              In such a case, . . . the legal person in question should be regarded as a ‘company’
        within the meaning of the Treaty to the extent that it is engaged in activities of a
        commercial nature, even if they do not constitute its principal activities.” 9

Since the Court then took “the view that it does not have before it all the facts necessary to determine
whether Bank Markazi was carrying out, at the relevant time, activities of the nature of those which
permit characterization as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty of Amity”, it held that would
be able to rule on that question “only after the Parties have presented their arguments in the following
stage of the proceedings” 10.


      11. The Parties’ arguments during the merits phase of the proceedings were then limited to the
22 security entitlements which had been at issue in the Peterson litigation. In its submissions
regarding these security entitlements, Iran did not call into question the position Bank Markazi had
taken before United States courts according to which “[a]s part of its foreign currency reserves, Bank
Markazi held $1.75 billion in security entitlements in foreign government and supranational bonds

at Banca UBAE S.p.A., an Italian bank” 11. The question of the status of Bank Markazi as a
“company” under the Treaty of Amity thus turned on the question whether this specific activity,
i.e. the maintaining and managing of foreign currency reserves (in the form of the 22 security
entitlements) by the bank in its capacity as a central bank, is a commercial activity within the meaning
of the Treaty of Amity. The Court has now responded to this question by finding that

        “the operations in question were carried out within the framework and for the purposes
        of Bank Markazi’s principal activity, from which they are inseparable. They are merely
        a way of exercising its sovereign function as a central bank, and not commercial
        activities performed by Bank Markazi ‘alongside [its] sovereign functions’” (Judgment,
        para. 50).

This is the crucial element of the Court’s reasoning, with which I agree.


       12. I am writing separately to express my view regarding the scope of the Court’s
characterization of the activity undertaken by Bank Markazi as “a way of exercising its sovereign
function as a central bank” (ibid.). Would this characterization also apply, for example, to the
purchase or holding of security entitlements by a sovereign wealth fund for the purpose of
accumulating and managing sovereign wealth or to the issuance of bonds by a central bank as part
of a debt-financing program 12? Would such activities be (inherently) “commercial” within the
meaning of the Treaty or also a “way of exercising [a] sovereign function” which would exclude
their commercial nature? This question is, in the first place, one of treaty interpretation.


       13. To answer this question it is, in principle, necessary to interpret the treaty term “company”
and to define more precisely the term “commercial activity” (which is itself derived from the treaty
term “company”). However, the definition of a term not only involves a positive determination of
what falls within its scope; it also involves a negative determination of what does not (per genus et
differentiam) 13. In the present case, the Court has found that activities which are of a sovereign nature
do not fall within the scope of the term “commercial activity” and that a line must be drawn between
commercial activities and activities of a sovereign nature.


       14. This distinction brings to mind questions which arise in the context of the international law
on sovereign immunities. Can the law on sovereign immunities be helpful in determining the scope
of what constitute “commercial activities” under the Treaty and thus the line between commercial
activities and activities of a sovereign nature? In paragraph 48 of the Judgment, the Court strongly
suggests that this is not the case, affirming that “it is not required to ascertain whether the entity in
question could claim, with regard to those activities, immunity from jurisdiction or enforcement
under customary international law”, that “[t]hese are two separate questions” and that “[t]he rules on
sovereign immunities and those laid down by the Treaty of Amity concerning the treatment of
‘companies’ are two distinct sets of rules”.

Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I), pp. 321-322, paras. 92-96, where the Court held that Article 4 of the Palermo
Convention, in referring to “sovereign equality”, does not “incorporate” the rules on State immunity under customary
international law.

       15. This repeated affirmation is certainly true in the most immediate sense, and the Court has
thereby made clear that it does not intend to overstep the limits of its jurisdiction by adjudicating
rights and obligations of the Parties under the law on sovereign immunities. However, this
affirmation does not preclude the Court, in a less immediate sense, from taking “any relevant rules
of international law applicable in the relations between the parties” into account when interpreting a
rule under the Treaty of Amity (see Article 31, paragraph 3 (c), of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties, a provision which reflects customary international law) 14. Such relevant rules of
international law include the customary rules on sovereign immunities. While the Court has not
explicitly taken them into account, I think it worth noting that the Court’s interpretation of the Treaty
of Amity conforms with practice, which indicates that the holding and managing of currency reserves
by central banks abroad is an activity which is generally recognized as a typical sovereign activity in
which the central banks of most States regularly and reciprocally engage, and which is specifically
protected by customary rules on State immunity15. The same does not seem to be true for the activities
of sovereign wealth funds 16.


      16. In my view, this background confirms that the Court has appropriately determined, in
conformity with the 2019 Judgment 17, that the relevant activities of Bank Markazi are not commercial
in nature and that Bank Markazi is therefore not a company within the meaning of the Treaty of
Amity.
