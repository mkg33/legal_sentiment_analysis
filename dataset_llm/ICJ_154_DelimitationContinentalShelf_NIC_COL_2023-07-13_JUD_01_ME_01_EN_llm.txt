       Serious misgivings about Judgment’s conclusion that under customary international law a
State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which
the breadth of its territorial sea is measured may not extend within 200 nautical miles from the
baselines of another State  Court arrives at a conclusion it could have arrived at in 2012 had it
believed that such a rule existed  Bifurcated procedure  No opportunity for the Applicant to
present its case in full.

       Conclusion of the Court based on hypothetical “assumption” and inconclusive travaux
préparatoires of the Convention  No trace in Convention or in travaux préparatoires that States
participating in negotiations “assumed” that a State’s continental shelf entitlement beyond
200 nautical miles “would only extend into maritime areas that would otherwise be located in the
Area”.

     Identification of customary international law  No widespread and uniform State practice in
support of alleged customary rule  Court ignores State practice that contradicts its finding.

      No opinio juris in support of alleged customary rule  Flawed methodology  Court infers
opinio juris from negative State practice  Negative State practice not motivated by a sense of legal
obligation  Court ignores the view of those States that maintain that a State’s continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles may extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State.

      Finding of the Court based on relationship between continental shelf and exclusive economic
zone  Court’s 1985 Judgment Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta)
misrepresented  1985 Judgment does not support finding of the Court.

      Finding of the Court departs from the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals 
Court provides no rationale for this departure  Fragmentation.

       1. This Judgment is disquieting. It has been arrived at by an irregular procedure which
prevented the Applicant from presenting its case in full as required by the Rules of Court. The Court
rejects the Applicant’s submissions just on the basis of its written pleadings. The Court is expected
to rule on the final submissions of the applicant as presented at the end of the oral proceedings which
have to be submitted by the agent in written, duly signed form 1. The Court in its Order of 4 October
2022 directed the Parties to address “exclusively” the two questions it put to them 2.


      2. The Court adopted this procedure without ascertaining the Parties’ views on the procedure
as required by the Rules of Court 3.


      3. The Judgment is not based on the application of international law but on a rule that the Court
simply “invented”. The Judgment does not provide any serious analysis of State practice nor the
required opinio juris. It limits itself to a simple assertation of “customary rule”.

       4. It is perplexing that, in its 2012 Judgment, the Court did not dismiss Nicaragua’s claim to a
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles on the basis of what the Court now asserts to be a
“customary rule of international law”. It is to be recalled that, already in 2012, Colombia presented
legal arguments in support of its position that a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond
200 nautical miles may not extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State 4, the
same arguments it has repeated in the current proceedings. The Court did not consider these legal
arguments in 2012. Instead, the Court decided that it could not uphold Nicaragua’s continental shelf
delimitation claim contained in its final submission I (3) 5 because Nicaragua, being a party to the
1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter “UNCLOS” or the
“Convention”), had not presented its full submission to the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (hereinafter the “CLCS” or the “Commission”) in accordance with Article 76,
paragraph 8, of the Convention 6.


      5. The Court subsequently confirmed, in its Judgment on preliminary objections rendered in
2016 in the present case, that it did not proceed to the delimitation of Nicaragua’s continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles for that particular reason, and not because Nicaragua’s entitlement cannot
extend within 200 nautical miles from Colombia’s mainland coast. Having heard the Parties’
arguments on the scope of its 2012 Judgment, the Court stated that

        “[i]t has found that delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from
        the Nicaraguan coast was conditional on the submission by Nicaragua of information
        on the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, provided for in
        paragraph 8 of Article 76 of UNCLOS, to the CLCS. The Court thus did not settle the
        question of delimitation in 2012 because it was not, at that time, in a position to do so.” 7


        6. Still in 2016, the Court was of the view that it would be able to proceed to the delimitation
of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles claimed by Nicaragua subsequent to the filing of
Nicaragua’s submission to the Commission in 2013. The Court has thus allowed a further decade of
litigation between the Parties, only to arrive in 2023 at the conclusion it could have arrived at in
2012, had it been convinced that this rule of customary international law existed.

        7. In its Order of 4 October 2022, the Court formulated two questions of law to the Parties:

               “(1) Under customary international law, may a State’s entitlement to a continental
        shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its
        territorial sea is measured extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another
        State?

pp. 23-26, paras. 31-51 (Lowe).
        5 In its final submission I (3), Nicaragua requested the Court to decide that “[t]he appropriate form of delimitation,

within the geographical and legal framework constituted by the mainland coasts of Nicaragua and Colombia, is a continental
shelf boundary dividing by equal parts the overlapping entitlements to a continental shelf of both Parties”.

               (2) What are the criteria under customary international law for the determination
        of the limit of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from
        which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured and, in this regard, do paragraphs 2
        to 6 of Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea reflect
        customary international law?” 8


      8. In today’s Judgment the Court rejects Nicaragua’s request for delimitation because,
according to it, under customary international law, a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond
200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured “may
not extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State” (Judgment, para. 79).
Today’s conclusion by the Court is surprising since the Court is supposed to know the law (iura novit
curia). As the Court has stated in the past,

        “as an international judicial organ, [it] is deemed to take judicial notice of international
        law . . . It being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the
        given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of
        international law cannot be imposed upon any of the parties, for the law lies within the
        judicial knowledge of the Court.” 9

The question remains why the Court did not adopt this view in 2012. No answer is given in the
present Judgment.



                              I. SCOPE AND MEANING OF THE FIRST QUESTION

       10. The Court’s first question concerns only one step in the delimitation process. As the
Judgment correctly points out, “[a]n essential step in any delimitation is to determine whether there
are entitlements, and whether they overlap” (Judgment, para. 42). This step is essential for at least
two reasons. For one, what States claim to be entitled to, and what they are in point of fact entitled
to, do not always coincide; the Court must therefore determine for itself what the parties’ entitlements
are. It does so by identifying the parties’ coasts that generate entitlements to maritime areas.
Entitlements are said to “overlap” when the projections from the coast of one party overlap with
projections from the coast of the other party 10. This step is also essential because overlapping
entitlements are a condition precedent for the Court to proceed to delimitation; in the absence of
overlapping entitlements, there is simply nothing for the Court to delimit.

       11. The Court’s question is directed at this preliminary step of the delimitation process (which
I will for convenience refer to simply as “the identification step”). The question has been framed in
terms of law, as a legal question in general, not in terms of the circumstances of the present case.


       12. At risk of stating the obvious, just because a State is entitled to a certain maritime area,
this does not mean that it must obtain the full extent of that entitlement at the end of the delimitation

process. Unlike a valid title over a certain territory, which implies the exclusion of any other title
over the same territory, maritime entitlements have the particular feature that they can overlap with
other maritime entitlements 11. As the Court explained in the Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea
case, the task of delimitation consists of “resolving the overlapping claims by drawing a line of
separation of the maritime areas concerned” 12. This requires that, so far as possible, the line of
delimitation should “allow the coasts of the [p]arties to produce their effects in terms of maritime
entitlements in a reasonable and mutually balanced way” 13. Entitlements can be amputated to achieve
an equitable solution. The delimitation process often results in one or both parties not obtaining areas
that they would otherwise be entitled to had it not been for the presence of the other 14.

       14. It is also useful to say a word about the problem which is at the heart of the Court’s question
and to put this problem into context. Usually, the identification step is a straightforward exercise,
even when the parties disagree, for example, about the identification of their relevant coasts. Not so
in the present case. The existence and breadth of Nicaragua’s entitlement to a continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles 15 must be determined by the application of the geomorphological and
geological criteria set out in Article 76 of the Convention, rather than just the configuration of its
coasts 16. To establish its entitlement, Nicaragua relies on its 2013 submission to the Commission.
According to Nicaragua, this submission provides sufficient data to show that it has an entitlement
to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in accordance with the geological and
geomorphological criteria, the limits of which are subject to the constraints set out in Article 76,
paragraph 5, of the Convention. Colombia opposes this claim. It argues that Nicaragua has not
established that the natural prolongation from Nicaragua’s land territory extends far enough to
overlap with Colombia’s 200-nautical-mile entitlement to the continental shelf, measured from
Colombia’s mainland coast 17.

      If Colombia is correct on the facts, there would be no need for the Court to proceed to the
delimitation as there would be no overlapping entitlements within 200 nautical miles from
Colombia’s mainland coast.

         15 I shall avoid the use of the expression “extended continental shelf”. Though perhaps convenient as a shorthand

expression, it finds no basis in the Convention and can be misleading. Obviously, when a State claims a continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles, it is not “extending” its continental shelf or claiming something additional to the continental
shelf. It is merely asserting the outer limits of an entitlement that international law recognizes exist ipso facto and ab initio.
See paragraph 29 of this opinion.
        16 Though it must be stated that, because Nicaragua invokes the distance constraint line in the delineation of the

outer limits of the continental shelf in accordance with Article 76, paragraph 5, of the Convention, Nicaragua’s coast
remains relevant. The distance constraint line submitted by Nicaragua is constructed by arcs at 350 nautical miles’ distance
from the baselines from which the territorial sea is measured.

       15. But this is not the problem at the heart of the Court’s question. The problem at the heart of
the Court’s question — and of today’s Judgment — is one of law. It concerns a situation where, in a
given area, broad-margin State A claims an entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
miles from its coast and within 200 nautical miles from the coast of State B, where the latter State
has a continental shelf entitlement based on the 200 nautical miles distance criterion and an
entitlement to an exclusive economic zone up to 200 nautical miles. This situation is not a new
phenomenon, nor is it uncommon; international courts and tribunals have been faced with it on
several occasions.

debated a similar issue, where Canada, for convenience, referred to an area of overlapping
entitlements beyond 200 nautical miles from the United States’ coast but within 200 nautical miles
from its coast as the “grey area” 18. While the Chamber of the Court was not called upon to delimit
the parties’ entitlements in that area, the parties in that case advocated for different delimitation lines
that created grey areas of varying sizes when extended seaward 19. This issue was also before the
arbitral tribunal in the Arbitration between Barbados and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 20.
However, the tribunal took no position on “the substance of the problem” 21. Three other cases,
namely the two cases concerning the delimitation in the Bay of Bengal, Delimitation of the Maritime
Boundary in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar) 22 and Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary
Arbitration (Bangladesh v. India) 23 (hereinafter the “Bay of Bengal cases”), as well as the Court’s
Judgment in the Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v. Kenya) case 24, have also
addressed this issue. I shall return to these cases and their implications below.

      17. In the present case, the area of overlapping entitlements arises because Nicaragua claims
a continental shelf entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles that extends far out into the Western
Caribbean and within 200 nautical miles of Colombia’s mainland coast, where it encounters
Colombia’s entitlement to a continental shelf based on the 200 nautical miles distance criterion.

of law such an overlap of entitlements may occur in the first place. That is: is a State “prevented”
from claiming its continental shelf entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles into an area that is claimed
by another coastal State as its own continental shelf on the basis of the 200 nautical miles distance
criterion? Colombia has strenuously argued that this is so.


       19. It should be clear that today’s Judgment is concerned with the area of overlapping
entitlements at the identification step. The question is whether the Parties’ entitlements overlap thus
calling for a delimitation. How the Court should then approach delimiting the area of overlapping
entitlements, and what the Parties’ rights would be in such a maritime area, is a question of equitable
delimitation that is not within the scope of the Court’s first question. In this sense, it is important to
distinguish between (1) an area of overlapping entitlements and (2) the maritime area that may be
established by a court or tribunal. This distinction is important. The Respondent seems to assume
that the existence of an area of overlapping entitlements in the Caribbean Sea within 200 nautical
miles of its mainland coast necessarily means that the Court will have to establish the same kind of
maritime area established, for instance, in the Bay of Bengal cases, with the same division of rights.
This is not so. Should the Parties’ entitlements overlap, it would be for the Court to adopt its own
equitable solution.

      20. I have set out these preliminary considerations in some length because they are necessary
to understand the Court’s first question.


                              II. ENTITLEMENT TO THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
                                      BEYOND 200 NAUTICAL MILES

      21. The starting-point of the enquiry is Article 76, paragraph 1, of the Convention. While the
Convention is not applicable as between the Parties, the Court has stated that the definition of the
continental shelf set out therein forms part of customary international law 26. There is no doubt in my

cannot have a different meaning in customary international law than in the Convention. The
Convention provides that the continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of
the submarine areas that either (a) extend “beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural
prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin”, or (b) “to a distance of
200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where
the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance” 28. In this respect,

                                                         -7-

Article 76 of the Convention contains a series of complementary provisions that define the
continental margin and specify how its outer edge is to be determined beyond 200 nautical miles.

       22. The first key provision is paragraph 3, which defines the “continental margin”. The second
key provision, contained in paragraph 4 (a) (i) and (ii), determines the position of the outer limit of
the continental margin by means of the application of two rules (sometimes referred to as
“formulae”). Both the “1 per cent sediment thickness formula” and the “60-nautical-mile distance
formula” specified in paragraph (4) (a) are applied by reference to the foot of the continental slope,
a geological feature. The result that one derives from the application of the formulae must then be
subjected to the constraints specified in paragraph 5. The first constraint in paragraph 5 (the “distance
constraint”) provides that the outer limits of the continental shelf may not exceed 350 nautical miles
from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. Alternatively, States
may apply the second constraint in paragraph 5 (the “depth constraint”), which provides that the
outer limits of the continental shelf may not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath,
which is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres.


        23. The distance constraint of 350 nautical miles can be set aside when submarine elevations
are still natural parts of the continental margin, such as its plateaux, rises, caps, banks and spurs 29.


       24. A State can use the most favourable combination of the formulae in order to establish the
outer edge of its continental margin and it can also use the most favourable combination of the depth
and distance constraints to establish the outer limits of the continental shelf 30.


        25. If I have outlined the rules defining the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond
200 nautical miles in some detail, it is not to show that the determination of the outer limits of the
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles is a complicated matter. It is to show what the rules bring
and do not bring to the table; they bring in concepts of geodesy, geology, geophysics and
hydrography, as well as very precise formulae and constraints. What they do not bring, however, is
this: the notion that a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles “stops” at,
or “cannot extend” within, 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State.


       26. The Convention is silent on the issue whether a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles may extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State.

geomorphological criteria set out above, subject to the applicable constraints under paragraph 5 of
Article 76. This conclusion is in harmony with the cardinal principle, often repeated in delimitation
cases, that “the land dominates the sea”. A State’s maritime entitlements derive from its sovereignty
over the land, notably its coast that generates maritime entitlements. As the Court observed in the
North Sea Continental Shelf cases 31, and later in the Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea case 32,



       29 Article 76, paragraph 6, of the Convention.

        30 However, there is one restriction on when a State is permitted to use the more favourable constraint (or

combination of constraints). According to Article 76, paragraph 6, “submarine ridges” constitute a special case to which
only the distance constraint (and not the depth constraint) may be applied.

Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 51, para. 96.

                                                         -8-

this principle is the basis for a continental shelf entitlement. The existence of a coastal State’s
continental shelf entitlement does not depend on the proximity to the coast of another State.

       27. There is also no reservation in the Convention that specifies that a State’s continental shelf
entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles cannot overlap with the continental shelf within 200 nautical
miles of another State. In the absence of such a reservation, it must be accepted that these entitlements
may overlap. As mentioned above, a feature of maritime entitlements is that they can overlap with
one another.


       28. The Parties have referred extensively to the travaux préparatoires of the Convention in
support of their arguments. But, as the Court’s Judgment correctly notes, the issue of one State’s
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles extending within 200 nautical miles from the baselines
of another State was “not debated during the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the
Sea” (Judgment, para. 76). This is not entirely surprising. It may be recalled that during the
negotiation of the continental shelf régime, only 30 or so States were seen as possibly having
continental margins beyond 200 nautical miles from their coasts that would call for the application
of the delineation procedure set out in Article 76 33. States may not have envisioned all aspects of this


       29. Despite the foregoing and the absence of any express limitation, in paragraph 76 of the
Judgment, the Court seems inclined to find a tacit limitation to the entitlement to a continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles on the basis of paragraphs 4 to 9 of Article 76, as well as Article 82,
paragraph 1, of the Convention, which concerns payments and contributions with respect to the
exploitation of the non-living resources of the continental shelf which would otherwise have been
part of the Area.

      The Judgment ventures that these provisions suggest that “the States participating in the
negotiations assumed that the [continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles] would only extend into
maritime areas that would otherwise be located in the Area” — the implication being that a
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles can only extend in the Area and not within 200 nautical
miles from the baselines of another State (Judgment, para. 76, emphasis added). There is no trace of
such an assumption in the travaux préparatoires of the Convention. In my view, this is a mere
supposition which, even if accepted, could not jettison the clear text of the Convention.

       The concept of the continental shelf had developed several decades before the adoption of the
1982 Convention. As the Court stated authoritatively in 1969, the rights of the coastal State in respect
of the area of continental shelf that constitutes a natural prolongation of its land territory into and
under the sea “exist ipso facto and ab initio, by virtue of its sovereignty over the land” 34. States had
long recognized this concept and accepted that it could extend beyond 200 nautical miles from a
State’s coast up to the continental slope, even if the precise outer limits of the continental shelf
remained debated 35. For a time, the breadth of the continental shelf was conventionally defined with
an exploitability test 36. But this was rather imprecise. The formulae and constraints of Article 76
described above were the results of extensive negotiation, and they constituted an attempt at defining,

but also limiting, the breadth of the continental shelves of broad-margin States 37. They provide a
methodology to establish the limits of the continental shelf. Given that the provisions of the
Convention were subjected to scrutiny and extensive negotiation, the idea that the Convention
imposes a tacit limitation on States’ continental shelf entitlements beyond 200 nautical miles is
untenable.


       30. Thus, in my view, the answer to the question “may a State’s entitlement to a continental
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles . . . extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another
State?” is “yes”. There is nothing in the Convention to suggest otherwise.


                                              III. JURISPRUDENCE

       31. The jurisprudence of the Court and international tribunals in maritime delimitation cases
supports the conclusion just reached. The Court and other tribunals have accepted that a State’s
entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles may extend within 200 nautical miles
from the baselines of another State. The Bay of Bengal cases, as well as the Court’s Judgment in the
Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean case, are particularly relevant here.

(hereinafter “ITLOS”) and an Annex VII tribunal accepted that the parties’ entitlements overlapped
in the grey area. In the first Bay of Bengal case, ITLOS delimited the maritime entitlements of
Bangladesh and Myanmar, including their entitlements beyond 200 nautical miles from their coasts.
As the ITLOS shifted the provisional equidistance line in favour of Bangladesh, the delimitation of
the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles involved an area located beyond 200 nautical miles
from the coast of Bangladesh but within 200 nautical miles from the coast of Myanmar, yet on the
Bangladeshi side of the delimitation line 38. Similarly, the arbitral tribunal’s delimitation within and
beyond 200 nautical miles in Bangladesh v. India involved an area lying beyond 200 nautical miles
from the coast of Bangladesh and within 200 nautical miles from the coast of India, yet on the
Bangladeshi side of the delimitation line 39. As a matter of delimitation, the tribunals allocated to
Bangladesh an area corresponding to its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles that would have
otherwise been areas of the continental shelf within 200 nautical miles of Myanmar and India. Thus,
these decisions are premised on the finding that the parties’ continental shelf entitlements could and
did overlap 40. As discussed above, this concerns the identification step (see paragraph 11 above).


       33. The Court’s Judgment in Somalia v. Kenya is also relevant. There, the Court accepted that
Kenya’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles could extend within
200 nautical miles from Somalia’s coast. In that case, the Court stated that, depending on the extent
of Kenya’s entitlement (as it may be established on the basis of the Commission’s recommendations),
the delimitation line constructed by the Court might give rise to an area “located beyond 200 nautical
miles from the coast of Kenya and within 200 nautical miles from the coast of Somalia, but on the

Kenyan side of the delimitation line” 41. The Court described this area as a “possible grey area” (which
is depicted on sketch-map No. 12 of the Judgment as a small grey wedge) 42. The reason the Court
used the term “possible” is plain. When the Judgment was rendered in 2021, the Commission had
not issued its recommendations in respect of Kenya’s submission on the continental shelf beyond
200 nautical miles 43. There thus remained — at the time, but no more 44 — some doubt about the
extent of Kenya’s continental shelf entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles. That said, the Court
considered that the parties’ continental shelf entitlements could overlap as a matter of law.

boundary beyond 200 nautical miles between the parties. It did so by extending, beyond 200 nautical
miles, the same geodetic line that constitutes the single maritime boundary delimiting the exclusive
economic zone and the continental shelf up to 200 nautical miles 45. The issue is this: had there been
no overlapping continental shelf entitlements, the Court would have been precluded from doing so —
at least initially. Somalia alone would have had a continental shelf entitlement within the wedge. The
Court would have had to draw a delimitation line taking a “zig-zag” course. The Court did not do so,
however. Presumably, it saw no bar in international law to delimit the maritime boundary in such a
way as resulting in Kenya’s continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles extending within


       35. The question may be asked how these decisions differ from the present one?


       36. In paragraph 72 — which is not a model of clarity — the Court’s Judgment is quick to
reply that these three decisions are “of no assistance”. The Judgment attempts to find safety in the
suggestion that the present case differs from these decisions because Nicaragua “claims an extended
continental shelf that lies within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of one or more other States”
(ibid.). By contrast, says the Judgment, in the two Bay of Bengal cases, it was the “use of an adjusted
equidistance line in a delimitation between adjacent States [that], as an incidental result of that
adjustment, gave rise to a grey area”. Likewise, in Somalia v. Kenya, it was the use of an adjusted
equidistance line that gave rise, “as an incidental result”, to a possible grey area between two adjacent
States.

       It is hard to know what to make of this cryptic statement. What it seems to boil down to is a
distinction between States with adjacent coasts (the Bay of Bengal cases and Somalia v. Kenya) and
States with opposite coasts (as in this case). It is true that an area of overlap may arise and be dealt
with differently depending on the coastal configuration. When a tribunal delimits the entitlements of
adjacent States both within and beyond 200 nautical miles, a grey area will arise whenever the single

miles, and only one State has an entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles — as is
the case here — the grey area may have a different shape than the wedge-shaped areas seen with
adjacent States. The shape and size of the grey area, if any, will vary depending on the extent of a

         44 What was referred to as a “possible grey area” in Somalia v. Kenya has become a reality, for the recommendations

issued by the Subcommission of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf were approved by the Commission
itself and seem to confirm that Kenya has an entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its coast.

State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles as determined by a court or
tribunal applying the rules on maritime delimitation calling for the achievement of an equitable result.


      37. The Respondent insists that the grey areas of the Bay of Bengal cases and Somalia v. Kenya
were merely “incidental results” of the delimitation process. This looks to me self-defeating: to
suggest that they were incidental results of the delimitation is to accept that the parties’ entitlements
overlapped to begin with, and hence, that they can overlap as a matter of law46. Again, courts and
tribunals may only delimit the parties’ entitlements that overlap.


       This confuses the preliminary identification step with the final delimitation. I agree that,
depending on the circumstances of a particular case, there may be something inequitable in allocating
to broad-margin State A an area which it may claim as a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles
but that falls within 200 nautical miles of State B. In such a hypothesis, State B could be left with a
continental shelf not reaching 200 nautical miles from its coast, whereas State A would enjoy its
continental shelf both up to and beyond 200 nautical miles from its coast. However, this is a matter
of delimitation. The size of a grey area may have some role to play at later stages of the
delimitation — for instance, as a possible circumstance relevant to an equitable solution — but it
plays no role in determining whether there is an overlap of entitlements.

       The coastal configuration of States — whether they are States with opposite or adjacent
coasts — can have no bearing on the issue of principle whether, at the identification step, a State’s
continental shelf entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles may overlap with another State’s entitlement
to a continental shelf based on the 200-nautical miles distance criterion. The entitlement of the coastal
State over the continental shelf is the same, no matter its coastal situation 48.

       Rather, if grey areas are “impossible” because legally there can be no overlapping
entitlements — as today’s Judgment seems to conclude in paragraph 82 — then grey areas are
impossible no matter the circumstances.


       38. It seems, therefore, that there is no escape from the conclusion that today’s Judgment
departs from the Court’s jurisprudence and that of international tribunals. This jurisprudence contains
a consistent finding of law which the Court simply ignores. I regret that the Court provides no
convincing rationale for this departure 49. As my distinguished colleagues observed in the past, the
Court “must ensure consistency with its own past case law in order to provide predictability . . . This
is especially true in different phases of the same case or with regard to closely related cases” 50.

                                              IV. PRACTICE OF STATES

       39. I pass now to an examination of the existence of an alleged rule of customary international
law that would prevent a State’s entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from
extending within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State. According to the Court’s
settled jurisprudence, the existence of a rule of customary international law requires that there be “a
settled practice” together with opinio juris 51. Despite the importance of this question and the
extensive pleadings of the Parties on this issue, it is hard to say that the Court has taken its task of
identifying custom very seriously. The Court’s Judgment devotes only a single paragraph to its
“analysis” of this practice (Judgment, para. 77). In fact, the Judgment does not even summarize the
Parties’ arguments properly. I thus feel the need to give a very summary account of the Parties’ legal
contentions. Without being exhaustive, I shall also examine the two elements of custom below.


      40. Basically, the Respondent argues that States follow a customary rule according to which
natural prolongation “is not a source of title within maritime areas that lie 200 nautical miles from

[a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from their coasts] that would have encroached upon
the 200-nautical-mile entitlement of another State, but. . . stopped at the other State’s
200-nautical-mile zone” 55. This alleged body of practice mostly takes the form of 51 CLCS
submissions, which Colombia compiled in an annex to its Counter-Memorial 56.


       41. This argument is not new. The Respondent made the same argument in 2012 57.


                                                  A. State practice

       42. Is there a general practice of States in support of the putative customary rule? The answer
appears to be affirmative — but only at first sight. A number of States in their submissions or
“preliminary information” to the Commission have limited their claims to a continental shelf
entitlement beyond 200 nautical miles in a way that does not extend within 200 nautical miles from
a neighbouring State’s baselines. This practice of self-restraint varies in shape but is generally
consistent. Some States have placed the fixed points of their proposed continental shelf outer limits
on the 200 nautical miles limit of a neighbouring State. Others have used endpoints that deliberately
stop short of the 200 nautical miles limit of a neighbouring State. This is true both of individual
CLCS submissions and of joint submissions. This practice may be described as a form of “negative
practice”, in the sense that it consists of abstentions. I agree that this body of practice is not
insignificant. It originates from various parts of the world, and it appears widespread.

During the oral proceedings, counsel for Colombia referred to some 32 “filings” to the CLCS (18 full submissions,
14 submissions of “Preliminary Information”), suggesting that most States “approach other States 200-mile limits . . . and
[avoid] encroaching on the 200-mile limits of other States”.

                                                          - 13 -

       43. Nicaragua argues that this body of practice is insufficient to give rise to a customary rule
because the States that have engaged in it “do not represent even 25 [per cent] of the State Parties”
to the Convention 58. This threshold argument misses the mark. In assessing the generality of State
practice, regard must be had to those States that are particularly involved in the relevant activity or
are most likely to be concerned with the alleged customary rule. In the present case, this includes
those broad-margin States that can claim a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles that can
extend within 200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State. Within this more limited “pool”
of States, the question is whether most States have adopted a representative and consistent practice
not to claim a continental shelf entitlement so close to another State’s coast. The Court’s Judgment
proceeds on the basis of this postulate to assess this body of practice. Rightly so.


       44. This being said, I feel bound to say that the Court’s analysis is incomplete.


       45. For one, the Judgment does not acknowledge, much less analyse, the existence of contrary
State practice whereby States have claimed a continental shelf entitlement that extends within
200 nautical miles from the baselines of another State. Examples — some of them uncontroversial
as between the Parties — include: (i) Bangladesh’s 2011 submission in respect of the Bay of
Bengal 59; (ii) Cameroon’s 2009 preliminary information in respect of the Gulf of Guinea 60;
(iii) China’s 2012 partial submission in part of the East China Sea 61; (iv) France’s 2014 partial
submission in respect of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 62; (v) Korea’s 2012 partial submission in respect
of the East China Sea 63; (vi) the Applicant’s 2013 submission in respect of the Caribbean Sea 64;
