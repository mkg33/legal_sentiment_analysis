1. I regret that I am unable to share the view of the Chamber with
regard to the legal situation of the maritime spaces within and outside the
Gulf of Fonseca. My dissent is a result of my understanding of the con-
temporary as well as the traditional law of the sea, an understanding
which seems to be greatly at variance with the views underlying the pres-
ent Judgment.

2. The Chamber defines the Gulf of Fonseca as “an historic bay”
(Judgment, para. 432 (1)). In my view, however, the Gulf of Fonseca is not
a “bay” as conceived in the law of the sea, since the concept of a “pluri-
State bay” which the Chamber employs to characterize the Gulf has no
existence as a legal institution. Neither does the Gulf of Fonseca actually
fall into the category of a “historic bay”, despite what the Chamber
assumes.

3. The decision of the Chamber concerning the legal status of the
waters in the Gulf, reading that

“the waters of the Gulf. . . were. . . held in sovereignty by the Repub-
lic of El Salvador, the Republic of Honduras, and the Republic of
Nicaragua, jointly, and continue to be so held ... but excluding a
belt... extending 3 miles (1 marine league) from the littoral of each
of the three States, such belt being under the exclusive sovereignty of
the coastal State . . .” (ibid.)

seems to be totally unfounded. I believe, on the contrary, that the waters in
the Gulf of Fonseca off the shores of the three riparian States, El Salvador,
Honduras and Nicaragua, constitute, under general rules of the law of the
sea (that is, international law itself), the sum of the distinct territorial seas
of each respective State.

II. “Bay” OR “HisTorIC BAY”: LEGAL CONCEPTS UNDER THE
LAW OF THE SEA

1. The Legal Status of a Bay towards the Turn of this Century

7. The parallel régimes of the open seas, free from the control of any
State, and of the waters which lie under the territorial sovereignty of coas-
tal States — the territorial waters in the traditional sense —, are centuries
old and have not until recent times, when the concepts of the continental
shelf and the exclusive economic zone emerged, been placed in doubt.
The problem of the way in which the borders of these two parallel régimes
were to be drawn involved, as a preliminary issue, the question of the
breadth of the coastal maritime belt around or alongside the land. The rule
of the range of cannon-shot, which had prevailed in the last century, was
about to be replaced by some fixed limits when the régime for territorial
jurisdiction over coastal waters extending over a breadth of 1 marine
league was emerging in parallel with the 1878 Territorial Waters Jurisdic-
tion Act of Great Britain.

8. The legalconcept of a “bay” emerged only in parallel with this devel-
opment as an exception to the régime of | marine league territorial juris-
diction. While there would not have been any problem in a case where



opposite headlands at the mouth of a geographical bay were less than
2 marine leagues apart (even when its centre was at a greater distance than
1 marine league from either coast) some slightly wider distances between
the headlands, reflecting the real range of cannon-shot at that time, were
proposed as permitting the entire waters of abay to be under the territorial
jurisdiction of a single riparian State.

9. In 1894 the Institut de droit international, under the Presidency of
Louis Renault and with the assistance of Thomas Barclay as Rapporteur,
adopted the following rules:

“Pour les baies, la mer territoriale suit les sinuosités de la cote,
sauf qu’elle est mesurée a partir d’une ligne droite tirée en travers de
la baie dans la partie la plus rapprochée de l’ouverture vers la mer, où
l’écart entre les deux côtes de la baie est de douze milles marins de
largeur, à moins qu’un usage continu et séculaire n’ait consacré une
largeur plus grande.” (Règles sur la définition et le régime de la mer
territoriale, Art. 3, Annuaire de l’Institut de droit international, XITI,
1894-1895, p. 329.)

In the year that followed, the International Law Association (Thomas
Barclay being the Secretary of the Special Committee on Territorial
Waters) adopted the same provision, with the exception that the distance
of 12 miles would be replaced by 10 miles (International Law Association,
Report of the Seventeenth Conference, 1895, p. 109). These ideas are well
reflected by Oppenheim, who first published in 1905 his most well-known
treatise on international law:

“[Territorial Gulfs and Bays]

It is generally admitted that such gulfs and bays as are enclosed by
the land of one and the same riparian State, and whose entrance from
the sea is narrow enough to be commanded by coast batteries erected
on one or both sides of the entrance, belong to the territory of the
riparian State even if the entrance is wider than two marine leagues,
or six miles.” (L. Oppenheim, International Law, Vol. I, 1st ed., 1905,
p. 246, para. 191.)

The 10-mile rule was confirmed in the Award given in 1910 by the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries
case (UNRIAA, Vol. XI, pp. 167, 199). am suggesting not that the 10-mile
rule had then become established but that the concept of a bay was about
to be realized as constituting an exception to the 1-marine-league terri-
torial sea in the case of special configurations of the coast forming a geo-
graphical bay.

10. It is further important to note that a riparian State’s continued or
long-standing usage of the waters in a geographical bay was made a fur-
ther source of derogation from the rule based on a maximum width of
mouth, so that the whole of the waters in a bay characterized by such usage



could be placed, as a unity, under the territorial jurisdiction of the State in
question. Some national practice, involving a claim to territoriality over
certain bays on the ground of continued or long-standing usage, had
been reported. In the case of Delaware Bay in the United States (which is
10 miles across at its entrance and 40 miles long from its entrance to the
mouth of the Delaware River), Attorney-General Randolph, in 1793, ren-
dered (in the case of the capture of the British vessel Grange by a French
frigate) an opinion to the effect that the bay was within the jurisdiction of
the United States, and Secretary of State Jefferson took action accord-
ingly. As for Chesapeake Bay (which is 12 miles across at its entrance), its
status was considered in 1885 by the Second Court of Commissioners of
Alabama Claims in the case of the Alleganean, a vessel which had been
sunk in the waters of the bay by the Confederate forces, and the Court
held that this bay was entirely within the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States. In Regina v. Cunningham in 1859, Chief Justice Cockburn
held that the part of the sea in the Bristol Channel (the width of its mouth
being slightly more than 10 miles), where wounding of a seaman on board
the Gleaner had occurred, formed part of the County of Glamorgan. A
claim by Great Britain to Conception Bay in Newfoundland (which is
20 miles across at its entrance) was upheld in 1877 by the Privy Council in
the case of The Direct United States Cable Co. Ltd. v. The Anglo-American
Telegraph Company.

11. These four cases simply present examples of the practice whereby
States claimed exceptions to the geographical requirements governing a
bay on the basis of their historic exercise of authority. These examples of
national practice, among others, were reported in most of the leading
treatises of international law towards the turn of the last century. I
quote again, as one example, from Oppenheim’s 1905 work :

“[Territorial Gulfs and Bays]

Some writers maintain that gulfs and bays whose entrance is wider
than ten miles, or three and a third marine leagues, cannot belong to
the territory of the riparian State, and the practice of some States
accords with this opinion. But the practice of other countries,
approved by many writers, goes beyond this limit. Thus Great Britain
holds the Bay of Conception in Newfoundland to be territorial,
although it goes forty miles into the land and has an entrance fifteen
miles wide. And the United States claim the Chesapeake and Dela-
ware Bays, as well as other inlets of the same character, as territorial,
although many European writers oppose this claim.” (Op. cit, Vol. I,
1905, para. 191.)



Those bays were given the name “historic bay”, probably for the first time,
in the 1910 Arbitral Award in the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries case
(UNRIAA, Vol. XI, pp. 167, 197). The term “historic bay” was found in
hardly any document prior to 1910.

12. Exceptas regards bays such as those listed above, the legal rule gov-
erning a bay-feature was well expressed by the opinion of the Institut de
droit international in 1894, which was partly quoted above, to the effect
that “[plour les baies, la mer territoriale suit les sinuosités de la côte”. It
should also be noted that, according to Oppenheim (1905),

“[Non-territorial Gulfs and Bays]

Gulfs and bays surrounded by the land of one and the same ripar-
ian State whose entrance is so wide that it cannot be commanded by
coast batteries, and, further, all gulfs and bays enclosed by the land of
more than one riparian State, however narrow their entrance may be,
are non-territorial. They are parts of the Open Sea, the marginal belt
inside the gulfs and bays excepted.” (Op. cit, para. 192.)

13. To conclude, a geographical bay which was bordered by the land of
two or more riparian States could not, as one area, be accorded any spe-
cial status in the law of the sea; thus the waters inside such a bay were left
as being the maritime belt (the territorial sea) and the open sea (high seas).
One can hardly find any scholar towards the beginning of this century
who had ever argued the case of a “pluri-State bay”, to use the Chamber’s
term. In addition, while claims to the territoriality of a bay the mouth of
which spanned more than a certain fixed limit (say 10 miles) had been
made on grounds of immemorial usage, or for historical reasons, as the
examples given above indicate, it is certain that no such claim was ever, or
could have been, made in respect of any bay the coast of which was
divided among two or more States.

2. The Concept of a Bay throughout the Codification
Process of the Law of the Sea

THE PRESENT JUDGMENT

1. Impact of the Misapplication of the Term “Historic Bay”
in the 1917 Judgment

27. The Gulf of Fonseca appeared for the first time on the legal stage
clothed as “a historic bay possessed of the characteristics of a closed sea”
in the 1917 Judgment of the Central American Court of Justice (trans.
AJIL, Vol. 11, p. 716). It was not until the rendering of that Judgment that
the Gulf of Fonseca began to be mentioned in any of the treatises of inter-
national law. Hardly any scholar of international law prior to 1917 had
thought that the Gulf of Fonseca, surrounded by three States, had become
a (juridical) bay, whether ordinary or historic, and was thus entitled to
some special legal status. (There was no mention of the Gulf of Fonseca
even in the eight volumes of Moore’s Digest of International Law in 1906,
or The Sovereignty of the Sea, Fulton’s classic work, in 1911.) Even the term
“historic bay” itself seems never to have been employed in a judicial deter-
mination or a scholarly work prior to 1917, except in the 1910 Award of
the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries
case, in which the Tribunal

“recognize[d] that the conventions and established usages might be
considered as the basis for claiming as territorial those bays [single-
State bays, including Delaware Bay and others] which on this ground
might be called historic bays” (UNRIAA, Vol. XI, pp. 167, 197).

The Gulf of Fonseca, a bay bordered by the land of the three littoral States,



was certainly not uppermost in the minds of the members of the 1910 Arbi-
tral Tribunal.

28. In contrast, practically all scholars dealing with the law of the sea
after 1917 have been in accord in echoing the concept of a “historic bay”
employed in the 1917 Judgment solely to define the Gulf of Fonseca, as the
present Judgment admittedly notices (see paras. 383, 394). Yet the fact
must be faced that the authors of the treatises in question simply gave the
name “historic bay” to the Gulf of Fonseca, as a unique case in which the
coast belongs to two or more States, solely on the ground that the Central
American Court of Justice, in 1917, had passed a Judgment employing
that term. Having never suggested any specific régime for even a single-
State “historic bay”, they a fortiorinever contended that the rules or regu-
lations established for such a régime should apply to this bay surrounded
by three States. This is so even in the case of Oppenheim, since he picked
up that Gulf only in his third edition, published in 1920 (International
Law, 3rd ed., 1920, p. 344, para. 192, n. 4), referring to it as an exception to
“[non-territorial] gulfs and bays enclosed by the land of more than one
littoral State”. Fauchille in 1925 (Traité de droit international public, Vol. 1,
2nd Part, 8th ed, 1925, p. 308: in Bonfils’ Manuel de droit international
public edited by Fauchille (5th ed.) in 1908 the Gulf of Fonseca was not
mentioned at all); Jessup in 1927 (The Law of Territorial Waters and Mari-
time Jurisdiction, 1927, p. 398); Wheaton in 1929 (Elements of International
Law, 6th English ed., 1929, p. 365: in his 5th English edition in 1916 no
mention was made of the Gulf of Fonseca); Gidel in 1934 ( Le droit interna-
tional public de la mer, Vol. 111, 1934, p. 604), and others, all followed
Oppenheim. These scholars after 1917 who referred to the Gulf of Fon-
seca as a (juridical) bay never presented any justification for this label
outside the fact that the 1917 Judgment had so styled the Gulf. Their state-
ments thus carry little cumulative value.

29. Some United Nations documents supplied in preparation for
UNCLOS I in 1958 also referred to the Gulf of Fonseca as a “historic
bay”, though as a unique case of one bordered by the land of two or more
States. In the Memorandum entitled “Historic Bays” (A/CONF.13/1;
UNCLOS I, Official Records, Vol. 1, p. 1) drawn up by the United Nations
Secretariat in 1957, this Gulf was the only example given in Part I,
Section I (“The Practice of States: Some Examples of Historic Bays”),
under sub-section B, “Bays the Coasts of Which Belong to Two or More
States”, but the explanations given therein did not go beyond a simple
reference to the 1917 Judgment. The Gulf similarly appeared again,
only with the explanation of the 1917 Judgment, in Part II, Section I
(“Legal Status of the Waters of Bays Regarded as Historic Bays”), under
sub-section B, “Historic Bays the Coasts of Which Belong to Two or More



States !.” The writers of the United Nations documents seem to have given
that Guif a somewhat special treatment without offering any sufficiently
convincing reasons, and did not suggest that the rules governing a “his-
toric bay”, if any, would apply in the particular case of pluri-State bays.
Although the application of the term “historic bay” was extended to the
altogether unique case of the Gulf of Fonseca, no rule was suggested for
pluri-State bays as such. This is not surprising, since a unique case cannot
be governed by the rules of a category : it requires the application of gen-
eral principles.

30. Likewise, in the present case, the two Parties and the intervening
State gave the name of “historic bay” to the Gulf of Fonseca simply
because the 1917 Judgment so called it. But they never proved any estab-
lished rules governing a “historic bay” bordered by the land of two or
more States, or even that a concept of a “historic bay” covering such a case
exists. The three States only concurred in maintaining that, because of its
alleged historical background as well as its geographical features, some
exceptional rules under international law should be applicable to the Gulf
of Fonseca. They did not share any clear picture of the Gulf in spite of the
common denomination of the term “historic bay”. They showed a total
lack of agreement or even of reciprocal understanding as to what elements
could constitute a “historic bay” and what really was the concept of a “his-
toric bay”. Each of these three States seemed to sketch its own image just
from the name “historic bay”.

31. The Chamber, in defining the legal status of the waters of the Gulf,
seems to depend greatly upon the 1917 Judgment of the Central American
Court of Justice, which it

“should take . .. into account as a relevant precedent decision of a
competent court, and as, in the words of Article 38 of the Court’s
Statute, ‘a subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”
(Judgment, para. 403).

! The Gulf of Fonseca is also referred to in another United Nations document
prepared for UNCLOS I: “A Brief Geographical and Hydrographic Study of Bays
and Estuaries, the Coasts of Which Belong to Different States”, by Commander
R. H. Kennedy (A/CONF.13/15; UNCLOS 1, Official Records, Vol. 1, p. 198) which
does not require any explanation here.



The Chamber, relying simply upon the 1917 Judgment, states that “[t]his
unanimous finding that the Gulf of Fonseca is an historic bay with the
character of a closed sea presents now no great problem” (para. 394) and
decides that “the Gulf of Fonseca is an historic bay . . .” (para. 432 (1)). It
is hardly necessary for me to repeat that, from the standpoint of the devel-
opment of the legal concepts of a bay or historic bay (as explained in
Part II, above), the Gulf of Fonseca cannot, under the law of the sea, fall
into the category of a bay or historic bay, the legal status of the waters of
which must be a united body constituting “internal waters” of a single
riparian State. By the same token, the Chamber’s decision that

“the waters [of the Gulf]. . . continue to be. . . held [in sovereignty by
the three littoral States, jointly]. . . but excluding a belt. . . extending
3 miles (1 marine league) from the littoral of each of the three States,
such belt being under the exclusive sovereignty of the coastal
State...” (Judgment, para. 432 (1))

is clearly incompatible with the Chamber's description of the Gulf as a
“historic bay”, which description cannot, a fortiori, be used to sustain that
decision. This point will be developed later in paragraph 38, below.

2. The 1917 Judgment Re-examined

32. How did the Central American Court of Justice proceed in order
to characterize the Gulf of Fonseca as “a historic bay possessed of the
characteristics of a closed sea” (trans. AJIL, Vol. 11, p. 716)? It simply
drew its conclusion on the basis of the replies given by each judge of that
Court in response to some questionnaires prepared in advance, among
which one question read:

“Ninth question — Taking into consideration the geographic and
historic conditions, as well as the situation, extent and configuration
of the Gulf of Fonseca, what is the international legal status of that
Gulf?” (Ibid., p. 693.)

It is also noted that “[t]he judges answered unanimously that [the Gulf of
Fonseca]is an historic bay possessed of the characteristics of a closed sea”
(ibid.). No ground except for these answers of the judges is to be found in
the 1917 Judgment which could justify the contention that the Gulf of
Fonseca was a “historic bay”, a concept hardly known to international
law except in relation to a number of (geographical) bays where the
authority of a single coastal State was for some historical reasons exer-
cised even beyond range of cannon-shot (such as Delaware Bay, the Bris-
tol Channel, etc.), and a term rarely used prior to the 1910 Award in the
North Atlantic Coast Fisheries case.



33. Certainly the Central American Court of Justice did not demon-
strate why the concept of a “historic bay”, previously applied solely to
some single-State bays, should apply in 1917 to the unique case of the Gulf
of Fonseca, enclosed by more than one littoral State. It seems to have mis-
interpreted both the 1910 Award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration,
which used the term “historic bay” only in the cases of a single-State bay
referred to in many historical documents (as mentioned in paragraph 28
above), and Judge Drago’s dissenting opinion appended thereto, which in
this respect did not depart from the Award itself (UNRIAA, Vol. XI,
pp. 167, 203).

34. Does the fact that the five judges of the Central American Court of
Justice unanimously agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca was a “historic bay
possessed of the characteristics of a closed sea” help us now to ascertain
the positive legal status of that Gulf? Whatever respect may be owed to the
1917 Judgment, it seems a needless self-restriction on the part of the
Chamber to have refrained from any critical inspection of its contents.
Due account should have been taken of the following points in that
1917 Judgment. Firstly, it was delivered in a case between El Salvador and
Nicaragua only, a case to which Honduras was not a party. Secondly,
that Court was constituted by agreement between five Central American
nations, including Honduras. Thirdly, Honduras had earlier lodged its
objection to the proceedings before that Court, on the grounds that it had
not been invited to participate. Fourthly, Honduras itself expressed its
objection to the decision of the 1917 Judgment that the Gulf of Fonseca
constituted a condominium, which concept, according to that Judgment,
was a logical consequence of the use of the term “historic bay”. Lastly, the
legal status of the waters of the Gulf as between all three riparian States
was not, at all events, necessarily at issue in the particular dispute submit-
ted to the Central American Court. These various factors should be taken
into account in considering the contention to the effect that the Gulf of
Fonseca is now a “historic bay possessed of the characteristics of a closed
sea”. The most important fact at that time was that the concept of “historic
bay = condominium” was introduced mainly in order to buttress El Sal-
vador’s contention that the building of a United States naval base on
Nicaraguan territory, facing the Gulf, should not be permitted.


35. The 1917 Judgment suggested that the waters within the closing-
line of the Gulf, which was a “historic bay possessed of the characteristics



of a closed sea”, were subject to a condominium created by joint inherit-
ance of an area which had been a unity in its entire history previous to the
succession in 1821 and, being neither territorial sea nor internal waters,
had been the object either of the joint ownership or of a condominium of
the three riparian States since 1821. It is important, however, to note that
in that Judgment the 1-marine-league belt would be excluded from that
régime, the waters of that belt thus being divided between the three respec-
tive riparian States. In the concrete terms suggested by the Central Ameri-
can Court of Justice,

“this Court has held [the Gulf of Fonseca] to belong to the category of
historic bays and to be possessed of the characteristics of a closed sea”
(trans. AJIL, Vol. 11, p. 707)

and

“[t]he legal status of the Gulf of Fonseca having been recognized by
this Court to be that of a historic bay possessed of the characteristics
of a closed sea, the three riparian States of El Salvador, Honduras
and Nicaragua are, therefore, recognized as coôwners of its waters,
except as to the littoral marine league which is the exclusive property
of each...” (ibid., p. 716).

Likewise, the present Judgment finds that “the Gulf waters, other than the
3-mile maritime belts, are historic waters and subject to a joint sovereignty
of the three coastal States” (para. 404). It also deems the waters of the Gulf
to be “the subject of [a] condominium or co-ownership” (para. 412). Thus
the Chamber decides that

“the Gulf of Fonseca is an historic bay the waters whereof, having
previously to 1821 been under the single control of Spain, and from
1821 to 1839 of the Federal Republic of Central America, were there-
after succeeded to and held in sovereignty by [the three littoral
States], jointly, and continue to be so held . . ., butexcludinga belt. . .
extending 3 miles (1 marine league) from the littoral of each of the
three States, such belt being under the exclusive sovereignty of the
coastal State, . . .” (para. 432 (1)).

36. This decision of the present Judgment which I have just quoted
above (and similarly that of the 1917 Judgment) is the part of the whole
Judgment which I find most difficult to understand. Does the Chamber
suggest that the Gulf of Fonseca, as a historic bay claimed to have been
inherited in 1821 or 1839 by El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua from
Spain or the Federal Republic of Central America as a condominium
without any division among them, is now composed of the (minimal) cen-
tral part of the waters, which remains subject to the joint sovereignty of
three States, while a 3-mile coastal belt along the entire coastline in the
Gulf (actually occupying most of the Gulf) is apportioned individually to
each of them respectively?



37. Topography and history indicate that, prior to 1821, the Gulf of
Fonseca was surrounded by the territory of Spain, as a single State, and
then until 1839 by the Federal Republic of Central America. Spain, and
subsequently the Federal Republic of Central America, might have exer-
cised a certain authority and control in its offshore waters. Yet there is no
ground for believing that at times prior to 1821 or 1839 Spain or the Fed-
eral Republic of Central America had any control in the sea-waters
beyond the traditionally accepted rule of the range of cannon-shot in the
Gulf. Both the 1917 Judgment and the present Judgment depend on the
hidden assumption that the maritime area in question was, prior to 1821
or 1839, not only “single and undivided” but also in its entirety (as a bay)
within the territorial jurisdiction of a single riparian State. They overlook
the basic fact that, in 1821 or 1839, there did not at the time exist any con-
cept of a bay defined as a united body of waters in terms of geographical
features and of the applicable legal status.

38. Another thesis implicit in the 1917 Judgment and the present Judg-
ment, which heavily relies upon its predecessor, is — in the words of the
latter — that “there seems no reason in principle why a succession should
not create a joint sovereignty where a single and undivided maritime area
passes to two or more new States” (Judgment, para. 399). This prompts the
question: if the assumption of unitary status for the entire waters in the
Gulf had been correct in 1821 or 1839, why should the 1917 Judgment and
the present Judgment not have preferred the far more natural interpreta-
tion that, once the territory over which a single State, Spain, and later the
Federal Republic of Central America, had sovereignty was divided into
five States as a result of their independence, the authority over and control
of the offshore waters (which had always been considered as appurte-
nances of the land) might have been divided correspondingly to the
divided territories of those newly independent States, and that the three
riparian States of El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua each inherited
authority over and control of their respective offshore waters of their own
land territory in the Gulf of Fonseca? Indeed, the 1917 Judgment itself
had recognized “the littoral marine league which is the exclusive property
of each [State]” (trans. AJIL, Vol. 11, p. 716; emphasis added), and the
present Judgment recognizes

“a belt, as at present established, extending 3 miles (1 marine league)
from the littoral of each of the three States, such belt being under the
exclusive sovereignty of the coastal State” (Judgment, para. 432 (1)).

39. The Central American Court of Justice seems to have contradicted
itself in suggesting at one and the same time the concept of “a single and
undivided maritime area [having passed] to two or more new States, [thus]



creat[ing] a joint sovereignty” and that of “the littoral marine league
which is the exclusive property of each [State]”. It appears to me that the
1917 Judgment was based upon a local illusion as concerns the historical
background of law and fact. If I may be allowed to add my view, the pres-
ent Judgment perpetuates an error in depending on the 1917 Judgment
and proposing in parallel “the waters of the Gulf. . . held in sovereignty by
the Republic of El Salvador, the Republic of Honduras, and the Republic
of Nicaragua, jointly” and “a belt, as at present established, extending
3 miles (1 marine league) from the littoral of each of the three States, such
belt being under the exclusive sovereignty of the coastal State” (Judgment,
para. 432 (1)).

40. My query continues: what is the legal status of the waters described
by the Judgment as follows: “the maritime belt in a pluri-State bay”
(para. 392), “the 3-mile maritime belts of exclusive jurisdiction”
(para. 393), “the littoral maritime belts subject to the single sovereignty of
each of the coastal States, but with mutual rights of innocent passage”
(para. 412), “the 3-mile belt of exclusive jurisdiction enjoyed by each of
the States along its coast” (para. 413), “the 3-mile maritime littoral belt of
exclusive jurisdiction within the Gulf” (para. 415), “the littoral maritime
belts of 1 marine league along the coastlines of the Gulf” (para. 416), “the
inner littoral maritime belts . . . not territorial seas in the sense of the mod-
ern law” (ibid.), “the internal waters of the coastal State, not being subject
to the joint sovereignty, and even though subject . . . to rights of innocent
passage” (ibid. ), “the exclusive littoral maritime belts. . . limited to 3 miles
in breadth” (para. 418), “internal waters subject to a single, exclusive
sovereignty” (ibid.)? After all, what is the 3-mile coastal belt in the concept
of the Judgment? I simply believe that the Chamber confuses the law of
the sea in applying such unusual concepts.

41. With regard to the concept of condominium (or co-ownership) or of
a joint sovereignty, which the Central American Court of Justice and the
Chamber employed to define the waters of the Gulf of Fonseca excluding
the 3-mile coastal belt (not of the whole area of the Gulf), it must be noted
that Honduras itself denies that the Gulf constitutes a condominium of
the three riparian States of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua and
refers to the absence of an agreement between the States concerned. I
agree that a condominium may be created by the consent of the States
concerned with respect to the area to which those States could have ori-
ginally been entitled. I am not suggesting any general rule that the concept
of a condominium should not be applicable in maritime areas. The pres-
ent Judgment refers to the case of the Baie du Figuier, where there has
existed a zone of condominium possessed jointly by France and Spain
since 1879 (Judgment, para. 401). This precedent does not, however, give
any ground for justifying the status of a condominium for the Gulf of



Fonseca, in connection with which no agreement between the States con-
cerned has ever existed. The rationale underlying the Baie du Figuier solu-
tion was that France and Spain agreed to keep the small area in that bay
(which itself is so small, the mouth of it being about 3,000 metres across,
that it could by the mere distance criterion have been under the jurisdic-
tion of either State) under their joint administration for the common use of
the anchorages in the roadsteads therein located (Déclaration pour la
délimitation de la juridiction de la France et l’Espagne dans les eaux de la
baie du Figuier, 1879, Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, Traités et conven-
tions en vigueur entre la France et les puissances étrangères, Second Volume,
1919, p. 141); the question of separate title thus yielded to practicality. It
is very evident that in the present case other considerations prevail.

42. I must also refer in this instance to the fact that, while the 1917 Judg-
ment did not use the term, the Chamber alone attempts to rely on the con-
cept of “historic waters” in order to define the waters of the Gulf of
Fonseca. I must confess that I am extremely confused as to whether the
Chamber is talking of “historic waters” for the whole area of the Gulf or
the (minimal) central part of the Gulf excluding “the three-mile maritime
belt”. The Chamber states: that “[the Gulf of Fonseca] is an historic
bay, . . . the waters of it are accordingly historic waters” (Judgment,
para. 383), that “[w]hat does present a problem. . is the precise character
of the sovereignty which the three coastal States enjoy in these historic
waters” (para. 395), that “[tjhe essence of the 1917 decision concerning the
legal status of the waters of the Gulf was . . . that these historic waters were
then subject to a ‘co-ownership’ (condominio) of the three coastal States”
(para. 398), that “the maritime area in question had long been historic
waters under a single State’s sovereignty” (para. 401), and that “the Gulf
waters, other than the 3-mile maritime belts, are historic waters and sub-
ject to a joint sovereignty of the three coastal States” (para. 404). The
Chamber seems simply to add confusion by its misconception of what
constitutes “historic waters”.

43. “Historic waters” were defined in the Fisheries case of 1951 as
meaning “waters which are treated as internal waters but which would not
have that character were it not for the existence of an historic title” (1.C.J.
Reports 1951, p. 130). In fact, waters in the situation of those disputed in
the 1951 case are by now enclosed as “internal waters” by an application
of the new concept of straight baselines under the 1958 and 1982 Conven-
tions, so that their “historic” background has become a superfluous refer-
ence. Similarly, a claim to a “historic bay” could have been justified by the
status of its waters as “historic waters”, but by now most bays known as
“historic bays”, such as Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, the Bristol
Channel or Conception Bay, have become, as I already stated above, ordi-
nary bays because of the new rule of the 24-mile closing-line. Further-
more, some “historic waters” in a rather different situation have also been



the subject of a parallel evolution. In the course of the preparation for
UNCLOS III, the delegate of the Philippines introduced a draft article
concerning “historic waters” reading that “historic rights or title
acquired by a State in a part of the sea adjacent to its coasts shall be recog-
nized and safeguarded” (A/AC.138/SC.11/L.46) and another draft arti-
cle on “breadth of territorial sea” reading that “the maximum limit [of the
territorial sea] shall not apply to historic waters held by any State as its
territorial sea” (A/CONF.138/SC.11/L.47/Rev.1). These proposals by
the Philippines did not appear in any of the texts which were later brought
to UNCLOS III. In fact, the waters which the Philippines intended to
claim on grounds of historic rights or titles would have been brought
under the jurisdiction of the coastal State in terms of the new concept of
“archipelagic waters” under the 1982 Convention, which would have a
sui generis status similar to that of territorial sea but not, however, to that
of internal waters!. In other words, the concept of “historic waters” has
become irrelevant in the case of the Philippines because of the agreed new
concept of archipelagic waters.

44, In sum, the concept of “historic waters” has become practically a
redundancy, which is perhaps why it does not appear in either the 1958 or
the 1982 Conventions. In fact, it is not so much a concept as a description
expressive of the historic title on the basis of which a claim to a particular
status for certain waters has been made. Thus, firstly in the 1951 Fisheries
case a claim to “historic waters” was used to justify the status of internal
waters, secondly a claim to “historic waters” for the waters of a bay could
have justified a concept of a “historic bay” the waters of which are “inter-
nal waters”, and thirdly in another instance, i.e., in the case of the Philip-
pines, it has been used to justify only the status of territorial sea, resulting
in the emergence of a new sui generis concept of archipelagic waters. It
follows, therefore, that “historic waters” have no special legal status dif-
ferent from the categories which have long been recognized, that is, either
internal waters or territorial sea (or the newly recognized archipelagic
waters): in other words, “historic waters” as such did not and do not exist
as an independent institution in the law of the sea. I have to add this expla-
nation because the essential implications of this terminology seem to have
been overlooked in the present Judgment, particularly when I note in the
Judgment the presumption that, the Guif of Fonseca being “[a] historic

is thus misleading.



bay, ... the waters of it are accordingly historic waters” (Judgment,
para. 383; emphasis added).

THE WATERS OF THE GULF OF FONSECA CONSISTING OF THE TERRITORIAL SEAS
OF EACH OF THE RIPARIAN STATES

45. Since the time when the rather vague concept of the territorial
waters or the coastal belt first emerged in the last century, the three ripar-
ian States of the Gulf of Fonseca had in principle maintained 1 league
(3 miles) as the limit of their territorial seas and there was no evidence that
their claims to territorial seas in the Gulf differed from their relevant
claims elsewhere. In addition, the three riparian States seem to have exer-
cised certain police powers for inspection beyond their respective
1-league territorial seas. El Salvador provided, in its Civil Code of 1860, in
addition to the 1-league territorial sea, that police powers should be exer-
cised outside the territorial sea to a distance of 4 leagues from the coast
(United Nations Legislative Series, Vol. 1; ST/LEG/SER.B/1, p. 71). This
claim was repeated in the 1933 Navigation and Maritime Act (ibid.; see
also Vol. VI; ST/LEG/SER.B/6, p. 126). Honduras likewise claimed in
its 1906 Civil Code (ibid, ST/LEG/SER.B/1, p. 71), in addition to the
1-league territorial sea, a 4-league belt for the exercise of its police power.
Nicaragua is reported to have taken the same position. Such a competence
on the part of the coastal State has been generally accepted since
World War I, particularly through the new régime of the contiguous zone
which the United States initiated in the bilateral treaties that it concluded
with a number of States. In such circumstances, no objection by any State
has ever been lodged against those three riparian States in connection
with their additional claims to exercise police powers beyond the territo-
rial sea.

46. Apart from those territorial claims over the waters of the Gulf, the
three riparian States could early in this century have been united in con-
sidering that the small expanse of sea represented by the waters of the
Gulf — which would in any event be covered by their respective territorial
seas and police zones — should not remain open to free use by any State
other than themselves. It would not have been surprising if the Gulf of
Fonseca had politically been the subject of a common interest of the three
riparian States, thus precluding unwished-for use or participation by
other States, or if their attitudes in 1917 had featured a common confi-
dence in rejecting the then prevailing “open seas” doctrine as applicable



to the waters of the Gulf of Fonseca. No evidence has been shown that
they actually voiced such a rejection, or asserted a corresponding historic
claim, jointly, and thus proposed for the Gulf a sui generis régime. Yet a
tacit implication to that effect led El Salvador then to raise an objection to
the establishment of a United States naval base on Nicaraguan territory,
and also lent impetus to the Central American Court of Justice in naming
the Gulf of Fonseca as a “historic bay” and in consecrating the idea of
shared ownership of non-territorial waters. This has also led the three
riparian States in the present case to unitedly denominate that Gulf as a
“historic bay”, even though, as I have suggested, this particular term has
been used erroneously to describe the Gulf of Fonseca.

47. Whether or not any precise delimitation of the territorial sea and/
or the zone for police powers was needed at any given moment for practi-
cal purposes, these waters in the Gulf could undoubtedly have been
properly divided by boundary lines and, in fact, a boundary line was
adopted in 1900 by a mixed commission established by Nicaragua and
Honduras, a line extending an approximate distance of 20 nautical miles
to a central point of the Gulf equidistant from the coasts of Honduras
(El Tigre) and Nicaragua, which are more than 10 nautical miles apart. It
is not known if the Governments either of Honduras or of Nicaragua had
any clear idea of the status of the waters they were then dividing. Yet Hon-
duras could certainly have proceeded to the same exercise of drawing a
boundary in relation to El Salvador, though this would in practical terms
have been more difficult owing to the existence of scattered islands in the
western part of the Gulf.

48. In the light of the claims made in the post-war period by the Latin
American States to a distance of 12 miles for the territorial sea, and given
the universally agreed 12-mile limit to the territorial sea under the new
régime of the law of the sea, the Gulf of Fonseca must now be deemed to
be totally covered by the territorial seas of the three riparian States. It
cannot, moreover, be disputed that the area which had previously been
claimed by each of these States for the exercise of its police powers has
been completely absorbed in the extended 12-mile territorial sea in the
Gulf. Thus I conclude that the waters within the Gulf of Fonseca now
consist of the territorial seas of three riparian States, without leaving any
maritime space beyond the 12-mile distance from any part of the coasts.
This, to my mind, is the legal status of those waters.

THE GULF OF FONSECA

(1) Within the Gulf

51. It cannot be overlooked that Honduras, whose territorial title to
waters in the Gulf is locked within the Gulf itself, has always enjoyed the



right of innocent passage through the traditional 3-mile territorial sea and
certainly will also be guaranteed this right through the now expanded ter-
ritorial seas of the other two riparian States, El Salvador and Nicaragua,
which territorial seas meet within the Gulf. The Chamber, in defining the
legal status of the waters of the Gulf, seems to be motivated by its concern
about the passage of vessels, whether of Honduras or of other foreign
nations, to and from the Pacific Ocean, but the right of innocent passage
is, in any event, protected by international law even in the territorial sea of
any State.

52. I must add, furthermore, that given the large measure of mutual
understanding displayed by the three riparian States in respect of the
common interest derived from their geographical location bordering on
the Gulf, it may be possible (under a new concept enshrined in the 1982
United Nations Convention) for them, as “States bordering an enclosed
or semi-enclosed sea”, to accept their obligation of “[co-operation] with
each other in the exercise of their rights and in the performance of their
duties under this Convention”, as provided for under Part IX of the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, entitled “Enclosed or
Semi-Enclosed Sea” (Art. 123).

(ii) Outside the Gulf

53. Ibelieve that I have sufficiently demonstrated the reasons why I am
unable to associate myself with the present Judgment’s finding to the
effect that, since a condominium of three States extends up to the closing-
line of the Gulf, Honduras, as one of the three, is entitled to claim an
exclusive economic zone and continental shelf outside the Gulf. Such a
finding is hardly tenable in the light of any rule, traditional or contempor-
ary, of the law of the sea. Because of its geographical situation, Honduras
cannot lay claim, in the offshore areas of the Pacific coast outside the
Gulf, to any territorial title in terms of the territorial sea, the continental
shelf or the exclusive economic zone. This is a geographical reality of
nature which — if I may adopt the Court’s dictum in the North Sea Conti-
nental Shelf cases — there “can never be any question of completely
refashioning” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 49, at para. 91).

54. Of course, as I have already stated, Honduras is fully guaranteed
access to the high seas of the Pacific Ocean outside the Gulf of Fonseca by
the unchallenged concept of innocent passage through the territorial seas
of the two neighbouring States both within and without the Gulf.

55. The concept of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic
zone has recently been developed to extend coastal jurisdiction to vast
offshore areas which had traditionally been regarded as a part of the high



seas. Thus the interests of the coastal State have been strengthened and
expanded — albeit at the expense of the general and common interests of
the international community to be enjoyed on the high seas — and the
general interests capable of being asserted by the international commu-
nity on the high seas are now diminished (although the navigation inter-
ests of non-coastal nations remain unaffected in those expanded areas). In
return for that sacrifice, land-locked States and geographically disadvan-
taged nations are assured, under the 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, of :

“the right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation
of an appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the
exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the same sub-region or
region . . .” (Art. 69, para. 1, and Art. 70, para. 1).

The “geographically disadvantaged States” are meant to include :

“States bordering enclosed or semi-enclosed seas, whose geographi-
cal situation makes them dependent upon the exploitation of the liv-
ing resources of the exclusive economic zones of other States in the
subregion or region for adequate supplies of fish for the nutritional
purposes of their populations or parts thereof, and coastal States
which can claim no exclusive economic zones of their own” (Art. 70,
para. 2).

This new concept of the “right to fish” in the exclusive economic zone of
the neighbouring State was introduced into the new régime of the seas to
compensate geographically disadvantaged States which might otherwise
have suffered owing to the expanded coastal jurisdiction of these neigh-
bouring States placed geographically in a better position. I should refrain
at this juncture from taking any interpretative position on the question
whether, in view of the fact that it has a long coastline on the Atlantic
side — thus enabling it to claim its own exclusive economic zone in that
region —, Honduras falls within the definition of “geographically disad-
vantaged States”, which would enable it to claim in the Pacific Ocean the
rights of “geographically disadvantaged States” under the 1982 United
Nations Convention. I would simply suggest that the possibility of Hon-
duras claiming or being granted such a right in the exclusive economic
zones in the Pacific of its two neighbouring States may not be excluded.
