Necessity of a finding on jurisdiction — Reasoning on jurisdiction not pre-

Rejection of Belgium's argument that it had in fact exercised no extraterritorial
criminal jurisdiction.

1. We generally agree with what the Court has to say on the issues of
jurisdiction and admissibility and also with the conclusions it reaches.
There are, however, reservations that we find it necessary to make, both
on what the Court has said and what it has chosen not to say when it
deals with the merits. Moreover, we consider that the Court erred in
ordering Belgium to cancel the outstanding arrest warrant.

2. In its Judgment the Court says nothing on the question of whether —
quite apart from the status of Mr. Yerodia at the relevant time — the
Belgian magistracy was entitled under international law to issue an arrest
warrant for someone not at that time within its territory and pass it to
Interpol. It has, in effect, acceded to the common wish of the Parties that



the Court should not pronounce upon the key issue of jurisdiction that
divided them, but should rather pass immediately to the question of
immunity as it applied to the facts of this case.

3. In our opinion it was not only desirable, but indeed necessary, that
the Court should have stated its position on this issue of jurisdiction. The
reasons are various. “Immunity” is the common shorthand phrase for
“immunity from jurisdiction”. If there is no jurisdiction en principe, then
the question of an immunity from a jurisdiction which would otherwise
exist simply does not arise. The Court, in passing over the question of
jurisdiction, has given the impression that “immunity” is a free-standing
topic of international law. It is not. “Immunity” and “jurisdiction” are
inextricably linked. Whether there is “immunity” in any given instance
will depend not only upon the status of Mr. Yerodia but also upon what
type of jurisdiction, and on what basis, the Belgian authorities were seek-
ing to assert it.

4. While the notion of “immunity” depends, conceptually, upon a pre-
existing jurisdiction, there is a distinct corpus of law that applies to each.
What can be cited to support an argument about the one is not always
relevant to an understanding of the other. In by-passing the issue of juris-
diction the Court has encouraged a regrettable current tendency (which
the oral and written pleadings in this case have not wholly avoided) to
conflate the two issues.

5. Only if it is fully appreciated that there are two distinct norms of
international law in play (albeit that the one — immunity — can arise
only if the other — jurisdiction — exists) can the larger picture be seen.
One of the challenges of present-day international law is to provide for
stability of international relations and effective international intercourse
while at the same time guaranteeing respect for human rights. The diffi-
cult task that international law today faces is to provide that stability in
international relations by a means other than the impunity of those
responsible for major human rights violations. This challenge is reflected
in the present dispute and the Court should surely be engaged in this
task, even as it fulfils its function of resolving a dispute that has arisen
before it. But through choosing to look at half the story — immunity —
it is not in a position to do so.

6. As Mr. Yerodia was a non-national of Belgium and the alleged
offences described in the arrest warrant occurred outside of the territory
over which Belgium has jurisdiction, the victims being non-Belgians, the
arrest warrant was necessarily predicated on a universal jurisdiction.
Indeed, both it and the enabling legislation of 1993 and 1999 expressly
say so. Moreover, Mr. Yerodia himself was outside of Belgium at the
time the warrant was issued.

Republic of the Congo complained that Article 7 of the Belgian Law:


“establishes the universal applicability of the Law and the universal
Jurisdiction of the Belgian courts in respect of ‘serious violations of
international humanitarian law’, without even making such applica-
bility and jurisdiction conditional on the presence of the accused on
Belgian territory.

It is clearly this unlimited jurisdiction which the Belgian State con-
fers upon itself which explains the issue of the arrest warrant against
Mr. Yerodia Ndombasi, against whom it is patently evident that no
basis of territorial or in personam jurisdiction, nor any jurisdiction
based on the protection of the security or dignity of the Kingdom of

”

Belgium, could have been invoked.
In its Memorial, the Congo denied that

“international law recognized such an enlarged criminal jurisdiction
as that which Belgium purported to exercise, namely in respect of
incidents of international humanitarian law when the accused was
not within the prosecuting State’s territory” (Memorial of Congo,
para. 87). [Translation by the Registry. ]

In its oral submissions the Congo once again stated that it was not
opposed to the principle of universal jurisdiction per se. But the assertion
of a universal jurisdiction over perpetrators of crimes was not an obliga-
tion under international law, only an option. The exercise of universal
jurisdiction required, in the Congo’s view, that the sovereignty of the
other State be not infringed and an absence of any breach of an obliga-
tion founded in international law (CR 2001/6, p. 33). Further, according
to the Congo, States who are not under any obligation to prosecute if the
perpetrator is not present on their territory, nonetheless are free to do so
in so far as this exercise of jurisdiction does not infringe the sovereignty
of another State and is not in breach of international law (ibid. ). The
Congo stated that it had no intention of discussing the existence of the
principle of universal jurisdiction, nor of placing obstacles in the way of
any emerging custom regarding universal jurisdiction (ibid., p. 30). As the
oral proceedings drew to a close, the Congo acknowledged that the Court
might have to pronounce on certain aspects of universal jurisdiction, but
it did not request the Court to do so, as the question did not interest it
directly (CR 2001/10, p. 11). It was interested to have a ruling from the
Court on Belgium's obligations to the Congo in the light of Mr. Yero-
dia’s immunity at the relevant time. The final submissions as contained in
the Application were amended so as to remove any request for the Court
to make a determination on the issue of universal jurisdiction.


territorial presence was required for the exercise of jurisdiction where the
offence violated the fundamental interests of the international commu-
nity (Counter-Memorial of Belgium, paras. 3.3.44-3.3.52). In Belgium's
view an investigation or prosecution mounted against a person outside its
territory did not violate any rule of international law, and was accepted
both in international practice and in the internal practice of States, being
a necessary means of fighting impunity (Counter-Memorial of Belgium,
paras. 3.3.28-3.3.74).

9. These submissions were reprised in oral argument, while noting that
the Congo “no longer contested] the exercise of universal jurisdiction by
default” (CR 2001/9, pp. 8-13). Belgium, too, was eventually content that
the Court should pronounce simply on the immunity issue.

10. That the Congo should have gradually come to the view that its
interests were best served by reliance on its arguments on immunity, was
understandable. So was Belgium's satisfaction that the Court was being
asked to pronounce on immunity and not on whether the issue and cir-
culations of an international arrest warrant required the presence of the
accused on its territory. Whether the Court should accommodate this
consensus is another matter.

11. Certainly it is not required to do so by virtue of the ultra petita
rule. In the Counter-Memorial Belgium quotes the Jocus classicus for the
non ultra petita rule, the Asylum (Interpretation) case:

“it is the duty of the Court not only to reply to the questions as
stated in the final submissions of the parties, but also to abstain from
deciding points not included in those submissions” (Request for
Interpretation of the Judgment of 20 November 1950 in the Asylum
Case, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 402; Counter-Memorial of
Belgium, para. 2.75; emphasis added).

It also quotes Rosenne who said: “It does not confer jurisdiction on the
Court or detract jurisdiction from it. It limits the extent to which the
Court may go in its decision.” (Counter-Memorial of Belgium, para. 2.77.)

12. Close reading of these quotations shows that Belgium is wrong it if
wishes to convey to the Court that the non ultra petita rule would bar it
from addressing matters not included in the submissions. It only pre-
cludes the Court from deciding upon such matters in the operative part
of the Judgment since that is the place where the submissions are dealt
with. But it certainly does not prevent the Court from considering in
its reasoning issues which it deems relevant for its conclusions. As Sir
Gerald Fitzmaurice said:



“unless certain distinctions are drawn, there is a danger that [the
non ultra petita rule] might hamper the tribunal in coming to a cor-
rect decision, and might even cause it to arrive at a legally incorrect
one, by compelling it to neglect juridically relevant factors” (The
Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice, 1986,
Vol. II, pp. 529-530).

“found it appropriate” to deal with the question of whether the issue and
international circulation of a warrant based on universal jurisdiction in
the absence of Mr. Yerodia’s presence on Belgian territory was unlawful.
This should have been done before making a finding on immunity from
jurisdiction, and the Court should indeed have “examined in some detail
various problems raised” by the request as formulated by the Congo in
its final submissions.

exercise jurisdiction over persons having no connection with the forum
State when the accused is not present in the State’s territory. The neces-
sary point of departure must be the sources of international law identified
in Article 38, paragraph 1 (c), of the Statute of the Court, together with
obligations imposed upon all United Nations Members by Security Coun-
cil resolutions, or by such General Assembly resolutions as meet the



criteria enunciated by the Court in the case concerning Legality of the
Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion (I.C.J. Reports
1996, p. 226, para. 70).

20. Our analysis may begin with national legislation, to see if it evi-
dences a State practice. Save for the Belgian legislation of 10 February
1999, national legislation, whether in fulfilment of international treaty
obligations to make certain international crimes offences also in national
law, or otherwise, does not suggest a universal jurisdiction over these
offences. Various examples typify the more qualified practice. The Aus-
tralian War Crimes Act of 1945, as amended in 1988, provides for the
prosecution in Australia of crimes committed between 1 September 1939
and 8 May 1945 by persons who were Australian citizens or residents at
the times of being charged with the offences (Arts. 9 and 11). The United
Kingdom War Crimes Act of 1991 enables proceedings to be brought for
murder, manslaughter or culpable homicide, committed between 1 Sep-
tember 1935 and 5 June 1945, in a place that was part of Germany or
under German occupation, and in circumstances where the accused was
at the time, or has become, a British citizen or resident of the United
Kingdom. The statutory jurisdiction provided for by France, Germany
and (in even broader terms) the Netherlands, refer for their jurisdictional
basis to the jurisdictional provisions in those international treaties to
which the legislation was intended to give effect. It should be noted, how-
ever, that the German Government on 16 January 2002 has submitted
a legislative proposal to the German Parliament, section 1 of which
provides:

“This Code governs all the punishable acts listed herein violating
public international law, [and] in the case of felonies listed herein
[this Code governs] even if the act was committed abroad and does
not show any link to [Germany].”

The Criminal Code of Canada 1985 allows the execution of jurisdiction
when at the time of the act or omission the accused was a Canadian citi-
zen or “employed by Canada in a civilian or military capacity”; or the
“victim is a Canadian citizen or a citizen of a State that is allied with
Canada in an armed conflict”, or when “at the time of the act or omission
Canada could, in conformity with international law, exercise jurisdiction
over the person on the basis of the person’s presence in Canada” (Art. 7).

the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, provides:

“Persons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumer-
ated in Article ITI shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State
in the territory of which the act was committed, or by such interna-
tional penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction with respect to those
Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its jurisdiction.”

“Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to
search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to
be committed, . . . grave breaches, and shall bring such persons,
regardless of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it
prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation,
hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party
concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a
prima facie case.”

Aircraft, 16 December 1970, making preambular reference to the “urgent
need” to make such acts “punishable as an offence and to provide for
appropriate measures with respect to prosecution and extradition of



offenders”, provided in Article 4 (1) for an obligation to take such meas-
ures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction over these offences and
other acts of violence against passengers or crew:

“(a) when the offence is committed on board an aircraft registered
in that State;
(hb) when the aircraft on board which the offence is committed
lands in its territory with the alleged offender still on board;
(c) when the offence is committed on board an aircraft leased
without crew to a lessee who has his principal place of busi-
ness or, if the lessee has no such place of business, his perma-
nent residence, in that State”.


“[T]he first and foremost restriction imposed by international law
upon a State is that — failing the existence of a permissive rule to
the contrary — it may not exercise its power in any form in the ter-
ritory of another State. In this sense jurisdiction is certainly territo-
rial; it cannot be exercised by a State outside its territory except by
virtue of a permissive rule derived from international custom or con-
vention.

It does not, however, follow that international law prohibits a
State from exercising jurisdiction in its own territory, in respect of
any case which relates to acts which have taken place abroad, and in
which it cannot rely on some permissive rule of international law.
Such a view would only be tenable if international law contained a
general prohibition to States to extend the application of their laws
and the jurisdiction of their courts to persons, property and acts out-
side their territory, and if, as an exception to this general prohibi-
tion, it allowed States to do so in certain specific cases. But this is
certainly not the case under international law as it stands at present.
Far from laying down a general prohibition to the effect that States
may not extend the application of their laws and the jurisdiction of
their courts to persons, property and acts outside their territory, it
leaves them in this respect a wide measure of discretion which is only



limited in certain cases by prohibitive rules; as regards other cases,
every State remains free to adopt the principles which it regards as
best and most suitable.” (P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 10, pp. 18-19.)

relevant treaty provisions not to exclude other grounds of jurisdiction
that may be exercised on a voluntary basis. (See Article 4 (3), Hague
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, 1970;
Article 5 (3), International Convention against Taking of Hostages,
1979; Article 5 (3), Convention against Torture; Article 9, Statute of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; and
Article 19, Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.)

diction that the accused be within the territory?

54, Considerable confusion surrounds this topic, not helped by the
fact that legislators, courts and writers alike frequently fail to specify the
precise temporal moment at which any such requirement is said to be in
play. Is the presence of the accused within the jurisdiction said to be

Further, such charges may only be laid by a prosecutor or juge
d’instruction who acts in full independence, without links to or control



by the government of that State. Moreover, the desired equilibrium
between the battle against impunity and the promotion of good inter-
State relations will only be maintained if there are some special circum-
stances that do require the exercise of an international criminal jurisdic-
tion and if this has been brought to the attention of the prosecutor or
juge d’instruction. For example, persons related to the victims of the case
will have requested the commencement of legal proceedings.


63. The Belgian legislation of 1999 asserts a universal jurisdiction over
acts broadly defined as “grave breaches of international humanitarian
law”, and the list is a compendium of war crimes and the Draft Codes of
Offences listing of crimes against humanity, with genocide being added.
Genocide is also included as a listed “crime against humanity” in the
1968 Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutes of Limitation to
War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, as well as being included in
the ICTY, ICTR and ICC Statutes.

64. The arrest warrant issued against Mr. Yerodia accuses him both of
war crimes and of crimes against humanity. As regards the latter, charges
of incitement to racial hatred, which are said to have led to murders and
lynchings, were specified. Fitting of this charge within the generally
understood substantive context of crimes against humanity is not without
its problems. “Racial hatred” would need to be assimilated to “persecu-

contended that, regardless of how international law stood on the matter
of universal jurisdiction, it had in fact exercised no such jurisdiction.
Thus, according to Belgium, there was neither a violation of any immu-
nities that Mr. Yerodia might have, nor any infringement of the sover-
eignty of the Congo. To this end, Belgium, in its Counter-Memorial,
observed that immunity from enforcement of the warrant was carefully
provided for “representatives of foreign States who visit Belgium on the
basis of any official invitation. In such circumstances, the warrant makes
clear that the person concerned would be immune from enforcement in
Belgium” (Counter-Memorial of Belgium, para. 1.12). Belgium further
observed that the arrest warrant

“has no legal effect at all either in or as regards the DRC. Although
the warrant was circulated internationally for information by Inter-
pol in June 2000, it was not the subject of a Red Notice. Even had it
been, the legal effect of Red Notices is such that, for the DRC, it
would not have amounted to a request for provisional arrest, let
alone a formal request for extradition.” (Counter-Memorial of
Belgium, para. 3.1.12.) / Translation by the Registry. |


72. An example is the evolution the concept of State immunity in civil
law matters has undergone over time. The original concept of absolute
immunity, based on status (par in parem non habet imperium) has been
replaced by that of restrictive immunity; within the latter a distinction
was made between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis but immunity
is granted only for the former. The meaning of these two notions is not
carved in stone, however; it is subject to a continuously changing inter-



pretation which varies with time reflecting the changing priorities of
society.




76. Such is the backdrop of the case submitted to the Court. Belgium
claims that under international law it is permitted to initiate criminal pro-
ceedings against a State official who is under suspicion of having com-
mitted crimes which are generally condemned by the international com-
munity; and it contends that because of the nature of these crimes the
individual in question is no longer shielded by personal immunity. The
Congo does not deny that a Foreign Minister is responsible in inter-
national law for all of his acts. It asserts instead that he has absolute
personal immunity from criminal jurisdiction as long as he is in office
and that his status must be assimilated in this respect to that of a Head
of State (Memorial of Congo, p. 30).


80. Under traditional customary law the Head of State was seen as
personifying the sovereign State. The immunity to which he was entitled
was therefore predicated on status, just like the State he or she symbol-
ized. Whereas State practice in this regard is extremely scarce, the immu-
nities to which other high State officials (like Heads of Government and
Ministers for Foreign Affairs) are entitled have generally been considered
in the literature as merely functional. (Cf. Arthur Watts, “The Legal
Position in International Law of Heads of States, Heads of Governments
and Foreign Ministers”, Recueil des cours de l’Académie de droit inter-
national de La Haye, 1994, Vol. 247, pp. 102-103.)

81. We have found no basis for the argument that Ministers for For-
eign Affairs are entitled to the same immunities as Heads of State. In this
respect, it should be pointed out that paragraph 3.2 of the International
Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States
and their Property of 1991, which contained a saving clause for the privi-
leges and immunities of Heads of State, failed to include a similar pro-
vision for those of Ministers for Foreign Affairs (or Heads of Govern-
ment). In its commentary, the ILC stated that mentioning the privileges
and immunities of Ministers for Foreign Affairs would raise the issues of
the basis and the extent of their jurisdictional immunity. In the opinion
of the ILC these immunities were clearly not identical to those of Heads
of State.

Having previously found that the issuance and circulation of the warrant
by Belgium was illegal under international law, the Court concludes that
it must be withdrawn because “the warrant is still extant, and remains
unlawful, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Yerodia has ceased to be
Minister for Foreign Affairs”.

88. We have been puzzled by the Court’s reliance on the Factory at
Chorzôw case to support its finding in paragraph (3) of the dispositif. It
would seem that the Court regards its order for the cancellation of the
warrant as a form of restitutio in integrum. Even in the very different cir-
cumstances which faced the Permanent Court in the Factory at Chorzôw
case, restitutio in the event proved impossible. Nor do we believe that
restoration of the status quo ante is possible here, given that Mr. Yerodia
is no longer Minister for Foreign Affairs.

89. Moreover — and this is more important — the Judgment suggests
that what is at issue here is a continuing illegality, considering that a call
for the withdrawal of an instrument is generally perceived as relating
to the cessation of a continuing international wrong (International Law
Commission, Commentary on Article 30 of the Articles of State Respon-
sibility, A/56/10 (2001), p. 216). However, the Court’s finding in the
instant case that the issuance and circulation of the warrant was illegal, a
conclusion which we share, was based on the fact that these acts took
place at a time when Mr. Yerodia was Minister for Foreign Affairs. As
soon as he ceased to be Minister for Foreign Affairs, the illegal conse-
quences attaching to the warrant also ceased. The mere fact that the war-
rant continues to identify Mr. Yerodia as Minister for Foreign Affairs
changes nothing in this regard as a matter of international law, although
it may well be that a misnamed arrest warrant, which is all it now is, may
be deemed to be defective as a matter of Belgian domestic law; but that


is not and cannot be of concern to this Court. Accordingly, we consider

that the Court erred in its finding on this point.
