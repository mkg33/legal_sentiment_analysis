   Jurisprudence of the Court and its predecessor regarding the question of the
existence of a dispute - Complaints offact and law formulated by Liechten-
stein against Germany denied by the latter - A legal dispute exists between the

tiary value in this regard - Subject-maller of the dispute - First preliminary

  Parties' interpretation of jurisprudence of the Court and its predecessor
regarding the legal test for temporal jurisdiction.

   Need for the Court ta determine whether the dispute relates ta facts or situa-
tions that arase before or after the critical date - Phosphates in Morocco
case - Eleetrieity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria case - Right of Passage
case - Text of Article 27 (a) of the European Convention for the Peaceful
Seulement of Displlle.l' does not differ in substance from temporal jurisdiction
limitations dealt with in tl/ose cases - Test ojjinding the source or real cause of
the dispute used in previous case law equal/y applicable in current instance -


sistently he/d that the Seltlement Convention depril'ed them of jurisdiction to
address the legality of any confiscation of property treated as German property
by tlze confiscating State - German courts did not face any "new situation"
when dea/ing for the first time with a case concerning the confiscation of Liech-
tenstein property as a result of the Second World War - Inextricable link ta
the Setllement Convention and tlze Benes Decrees - The Selllement Conven-
tion and the Bend Decrees are the real cause of the dispute - ln fight of the
provisions of Article 27 (a) of the European Convention for the Peaceful Set/le-
ment of Disputes. the second preliminary objection has ta be upheld - Court
not required to consider Germany's other preliminary objections - No jurisdic-
tian ta entertain the case.

Liechtenstein, Liechtenstein exercised its right under Article 31, paragraph 2, of
the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the case. It first chose Mr. lan

         Principality of Liechtenstein, referred to it by the Application of liech-
         tenstein of 30 May 2001,
     and/or that

         stein arc inadmissible ta the extent specified in the present Preliminary
         Objections. "

tion of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of
