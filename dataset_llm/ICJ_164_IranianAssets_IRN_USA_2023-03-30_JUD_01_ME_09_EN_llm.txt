was a measure necessary to protect its essential security interests.

       1. I agree for the most part with the conclusions and reasoning of the Court in this Judgment.
I regret that I had to vote against operative clause (3) of paragraph 236, in which the Court finds that
the United States has violated its obligations under Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity.
I will refrain from discussing the reasons for my vote on this clause, since I largely share the views
expressed in the opinions of other judges who voted against it.

       2. I will discuss three other topics in this opinion: the exhaustion of local remedies, security
exceptions in treaties, and the most constant protection and security. As regards the exhaustion of
local remedies, I will focus on some points which are not addressed at length by the Court in the
Judgment. The other two topics  security exceptions and the most constant protection and
security  are issues of significance in international economic law which are often raised in cases
and are attracting increasing attention in literature.

                                   I. Exhaustion of local remedies

        3. In the present case, the Court does not refer to the burden of proof with respect to the
exhaustion of local remedies, even though it affords a significant basis for its conclusions. In previous
cases on diplomatic protection, the Court has explained the burden of proof in connection with the
exhaustion of local remedies. In the ELSI case, the Court observed first that “the United States [the
applicant] was very much aware that it must satisfy the local remedies rule”, and then that “it was
for Italy [the respondent] to demonstrate that there was . . . some local remedy that had not been tried;

                                                            -2-

or at least, not exhausted. This burden Italy never sought to deny.”1 In the Diallo case, reaffirming
its statements in the ELSI case, the Court declared that,

        “[i]n matters of diplomatic protection, it is incumbent on the applicant to prove that
        local remedies were indeed exhausted or to establish that exceptional circumstances
        relieved the allegedly injured person . . . of the obligation to exhaust available local
        remedies (see [ELSI], pp. 43-44, para. 53). It is for the respondent to convince the Court
        that there were effective remedies in its domestic legal system that were not exhausted
        (see ibid., p. 46, para. 59).” 2


      4. In international law, as a rule, the principle onus probandi incumbit actori applies; it is
incumbent on the claimant to prove a claim 3. In the context of exhaustion of local remedies, the
burden of proof is allocated as follows 4. Since the exhaustion of local remedies is one of the
requirements for the exercise of diplomatic protection 5, an applicant which exercises diplomatic
protection must specify that the injured person has exhausted local remedies 6. If the respondent raises
the objection that local remedies have not been exhausted, it must identify the remedies which have
not been exhausted 7. The applicant then has to demonstrate either that those remedies were exhausted
or that exceptions to this rule apply, for example, that the remedies are ineffective8. When the
applicant makes a prima facie case that the remedies are ineffective, it is the respondent which must
prove that the remedies are in fact effective 9.

       5. In cases concerned with complaints brought by individuals, international human rights
courts have adopted a different distribution of the burden of proof for the exhaustion of local
remedies. The respondent State bears the initial burden of demonstrating that an effective remedy
exists. Once the respondent has discharged this burden, it falls on the individual to prove either that

        4 Judge Lauterpacht explained the distribution of the burden of proof in his separate opinion in the Norwegian

Loans case:
                “(1) As a rule, it is for the plaintiff State to prove that there are no effective remedies to which
        recourse can be had; (2) no such proof is required if there exists legislation which on the face of it deprives
        the private claimants of a remedy; (3) in that case it is for the defendant State to show that, notwithstanding
        the apparent absence of a remedy, its existence can nevertheless reasonably be assumed”. Certain

        Judge Lauterpacht, p. 39.

        8 For example, the Permanent Court of International Justice held that until it had been clearly shown that the courts

of the defendant had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit by the applicant’s company, the Court could not accept the contention
of the applicant that the rule as to the exhaustion of local remedies did not apply in the case. Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway,

it has exhausted that remedy or that the remedy is ineffective 10. This specific distribution of the
burden of proof adopted by international human rights courts does not necessarily apply in inter-State
diplomatic protection cases.


      6. In the present case, the Respondent raises the objection that local remedies have not been
exhausted with regard to some of the Applicant’s claims (see Judgment, paras. 55-56 and 59). In
response, the Applicant has made a prima facie case that the remedies offered by the legal system of
the United States are ineffective (see paras. 58 and 60). In these circumstances, it is incumbent on
the Respondent to demonstrate that they are in fact effective.


       7. Iran complains of a succession of legislative and executive measures which have effectively
removed the remedies available to Iranian companies, agencies and instrumentalities to challenge
enforcement actions against their assets. United States courts are bound to apply these measures
which leave little room for judicial appreciation. Iran contends that the comprehensive régime created
by the United States’ measures “is in practice not reviewable in the local courts”. For its part, the
United States maintains that local remedies provide a reasonable possibility of redress. However, as
the Court points out, “[t]he Iranian companies that succeeded in having certain measures set aside by
the courts were only able to do so by demonstrating either that the contested measures fell outside
the scope of the statute on which they were said to be founded, or that they were contrary to the
statute itself” (Judgment, para. 71).


       8. It is the combination of these distinctive features of the measures adopted by the
United States and the primacy accorded to a more recent federal statute over a treaty in the
jurisprudence of the United States which has led the Court to conclude that the companies in question
had no reasonable possibility of successfully asserting their rights in United States court proceedings.
The Court adopted this reasoning in the particular circumstances of the present case (Judgment,
para. 72). Therefore, this reasoning does not automatically apply to other circumstances in States
where a statute enacted after a treaty prevails over the treaty.

              II. The security exception in Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity

       9. The United States claims that Executive Order 13599 (“EO 13599”) falls within the security
exception set out in Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity. While the Court rejects this claim in
one short paragraph (Judgment, para. 108), I will make a more detailed analysis of the claim and give
additional reasons in support of the Court’s conclusion.


       10. I will focus in particular on the standard of review to be used for analysing claims made
under security exceptions such as Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity. Many treaties, including
other treaties on friendship, commerce and navigation (“FCN”), international investment agreements,
and multilateral and regional trade agreements, contain security exceptions. In recent years, States
have frequently invoked a security exception in a treaty to claim that measures which are inconsistent
with the substantive provisions of the treaty are justified. I consider that the standard of review to be
used by international courts for analysing such claims is of crucial importance.

      11. Article XX (1) of the Treaty of Amity provides: “The present Treaty shall not preclude the
application of measures: . . . (d) necessary to fulfill the obligations of a High Contracting Party for

       10 E.g. European Court of Human Rights, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996,

No. 21893/93, para. 68; Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Velásquez-Rodríguez v. Honduras, judgment of 29 July
1988, paras. 59-60.

                                                     -4-

the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security, or necessary to protect its essential
security interests.” The United States argues that EO 13599 was a measure necessary to protect its
essential security interests and was not precluded by the Treaty.

       12. Article XX (1) (d) may be considered as an affirmative defence. Pursuant to the principle
of reus in excipiendo fit actor (the defendant, by raising an exception, becomes a plaintiff), the
respondent  in this case, the United States  bears the burden of proving that the conditions set
out in Article XX (1) (d) are met. The Court confirms that this burden is placed on the Respondent,
declaring that “it was for the United States to show that Executive Order 13599 was a measure
necessary to protect its essential security interests” (Judgment, para. 108).


       13. Like Article XX (1) of the Treaty of Amity, Article XXI of the GATT 1994 provides for
security exceptions, but its formulation is significantly different. Article XXI of the GATT reads as
follows:

               “Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed

               ................................................................

       (b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary
           for the protection of its essential security interests

              (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;

              (ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such
                   traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the

             (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations”. (Emphasis
                   added.)


      14. In Russia  Traffic in Transit, a case filed by Ukraine under the WTO dispute settlement
procedures, Russia argued that Article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT 1994 was “totally ‘self-judging’”.
The WTO panel pointed out that “the adjectival clause ‘which it considers’” in the chapeau of
Article XXI (b) “can be read to qualify only the word ‘necessary’ . . . or to qualify also the
determination of these ‘essential security interests’; or finally and maximally, to qualify the
determination of the matters described in the three subparagraphs of Article XXI (b) as well”. The
panel concluded that the clause does not qualify the determination of the circumstances in
subparagraph (iii), and that for action to fall within the scope of Article XXI (b), “it must objectively
be found to meet the requirements in one of the enumerated subparagraphs”. It thus rejected the
argument that Article XXI (b) (iii) was “totally ‘self-judging’” 11.

       15. In the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
(Nicaragua v. United States), the Court analysed Article XXI (1) (d) of the FCN Treaty between
Nicaragua and the United States, which is the equivalent provision to Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty
of Amity between Iran and the United States. Neither treaty contains the phrase “which it considers”
or a similar expression. In the Military and Paramilitary Activities case and in the case concerning


       11 Panel Report, Russia  Measures concerning Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R and Add.1, adopted 26 April

2019, paras. 7.26, 7.63, 7.101-7.102.

                                                            -5-

treaties were not “self-judging”, stating that, “by the terms of the Treaty itself, whether a measure is
necessary to protect the essential security interests of a party is not . . . purely a question for the
subjective judgment of the party” 12. Given this clear statement by the Court, both Parties accept that



       16. In the Military and Paramilitary Activities case, the Court contrasted Article XXI of the
GATT with Article XXI of the FCN Treaty between Nicaragua and the United States, and
emphasized that the latter “speaks simply of ‘necessary’ measures, not of those considered by a party
to be such” 14. It appears that the Court attempted to distinguish between treaties which contain the
phrase “which it considers” and others which do not, suggesting that the latter are not “self-judging”.


       17. In the Oil Platforms case, however, the Court itself explained that “[o]n the basis of
[Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity], a party to the Treaty may be justified in taking certain
measures which it considers to be ‘necessary’ for the protection of its essential security interests” 15,
even though Article XX (1) (d) does not contain the phrase “which it considers”.


      18. In Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), the Court acknowledged
that Article 2 (c) of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between Djibouti and
France affords “a very considerable discretion” to the requested State because Article 2 (c) contains
the phrase “[i]f the requested State considers”. In parentheses, the Court mentioned the Military and
Paramilitary Activities and Oil Platforms cases as examples of “the competence of the Court in the
face of provisions giving wide discretion” 16. Thus, the Court acknowledged that the security
exception clauses at issue in those cases, respectively Article XXI (1) (d) of the FCN Treaty between
Nicaragua and the United States and Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity between Iran and the
United States, give wide discretion to the contracting parties, even though the said clauses do not
contain the phrase “which it considers”.


       19. The presence of the phrase “which it considers” certainly makes explicit the granting of
discretion to the State concerned. However, even in the absence of such a phrase, security exceptions
should be understood as affording the invoking State a fair measure of discretion 17.

the term “margin of appreciation” in the context of examining a claim concerned with fair and equitable treatment, stating
that tribunals should pay “great deference” to governmental judgments of national needs in matters such as the protection
of public health). Compare it with ibid., concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Born, Arbitrator, paras. 87, 137-138,
188.

       20. The Parties to the present case disagree on the standard that the Court should use in
reviewing the United States’ claim under Article XX (1) (d) and on the conclusion that it should
reach. Iran argues that an examination of necessity entails an assessment of proportionality, finding

contends that Article XX (1) (d) gives wide discretion to a State acting in good faith.


       21. In Russia  Traffic in Transit, the WTO panel set out the standard to be used in reviewing
measures taken under Article XXI (Security Exceptions) of the GATT 1994. It acknowledged that
the article is partly “self-judging”, suggesting that the phrase “which it considers” qualifies not only
the word “necessary” but also the determination of the “essential security interests”. The panel thus
admitted that “it is left, in general, to every Member to define what it considers to be its essential

particular concerns as ‘essential security interests’ is limited by its obligation to interpret and apply
Article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT 1994 in good faith”, and “[t]he obligation of good faith . . . applies
not only to the Member’s definition of the essential security interests . . . but also, and most
importantly, to their connection with the measures at issue”. The panel further explained that “this
obligation [of good faith] is crystallized in demanding that the measures at issue meet a minimum
requirement of plausibility in relation to the proffered essential security interests, i.e. that they are
not implausible as measures protective of these interests” 18. The analytical framework enunciated by
the panel in Russia  Traffic in Transit has generally been accepted by the Members of the WTO
and followed by subsequent panels 19.


       22. This Court also has considered that clauses containing the phrase “which it considers” or
a similar expression are subject to a good faith review. In the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters
case, the Court accepted that Article 2 (c) of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal
Matters, which contains the phrase “[i]f the requested State considers”, provides the requested State
with “a very considerable discretion”. It stressed, however, that “this exercise of discretion is still
subject to the obligation of good faith codified in Article 26 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties” 20.


      23. In respect of security exception clauses which do not contain the phrase “which it
considers” or a similar expression, the standard of review should be more rigorous than a good faith
review. In the Military and Paramilitary Activities case, the Court gave a brief outline of the standard
to be used in reviewing the measures taken under the security exception clause in the FCN Treaty
between Nicaragua and the United States, namely “[t]he Court has . . . to assess whether the risk run

being designed to protect these interests are not merely useful but ‘necessary’” 21. The Court
emphasized that “the measures taken must not merely be such as tend to protect the essential security
interests of the party taking them, but must be ‘necessary’ for that purpose” 22. This statement was
reaffirmed in the Oil Platforms case with regard to Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity 23.

of inquiry, an international court must assess whether the risk run by the essential security interests
is reasonable. The ordinary meaning of the term “essential security interests” in its context suggests
that it relates to the existential core of State functions, such as the protection of its territory and its
population from external threats and the maintenance of internal public order. It is for the State
invoking the exception to articulate the nature of the essential security interests at stake sufficiently
precisely to demonstrate their legitimacy in light of the object and purpose of the treaty.


       25. In the second stage of inquiry, an international court must examine whether the measures
are “necessary” to protect the essential security interests. The Court has stated that the measures must
not be “merely useful” nor “merely be such as tend to protect” the essential security interests, but
rather must be “necessary” to protect them.

       26. In the present case, Iran puts forward a stringent test to assess the necessity of a measure.
It argues that “[a]n examination of necessity inevitably entails an examination of proportionality”,
relying on WTO and investment arbitration jurisprudence 24. The test of proportionality requires an
assessment of any adverse impact resulting from the measure in relation to the achievement of the
objectives pursued by it. In the areas of international human rights law and domestic constitutional
law, courts  both international and domestic  have used the proportionality test in evaluating
measures that restrict human rights. In contrast, the WTO adjudicatory bodies have not applied the
proportionality test. Commentators have explained that this is because the WTO is not institutionally
ready for a balancing of values and interests. On the other hand, a number of investment arbitral
tribunals have used the proportionality test in the context of fair and equitable treatment 25 and indirect
expropriation 26. However, investment arbitral tribunals have not used the proportionality test for



      27. Whereas Iran invokes WTO and investment arbitration jurisprudence in support of its
contention that the Court should examine the proportionality of the measures, in those cases the WTO
adjudicatory bodies and investment arbitration tribunals in fact used the test of least restrictive

Appellate Body quoted the following statement of a GATT panel with approval:

             “[A] contracting party [of the GATT] cannot justify a measure inconsistent with
       another GATT provision as ‘necessary’ in terms of Article XX (d) if an alternative
       measure which it could reasonably be expected to employ and which is not inconsistent
       with other GATT provisions is available to it. By the same token, in cases where a
       measure consistent with other GATT provisions is not reasonably available, a
       contracting party is bound to use, among the measures reasonably available to it, that
       which entails the least degree of inconsistency with other GATT provisions.” 28

The test of least restrictive alternatives is not the same as the test of proportionality.


       28. Panels and the Appellate Body of the GATT/WTO established the test of least restrictive
alternatives to assess the “necessity” of measures under Article XX (General Exceptions) of the
GATT 1994. They articulated the test first in relation to subparagraph (d), which concerns measures
“necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations” 29. They subsequently extended it to
subparagraph (b) concerning measures “necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health” 30,
and then to subparagraph (a) pertaining to measures “necessary to protect public morals” 31. It is
inappropriate to import the test of least restrictive alternatives, which was developed for general

alternatives is also too stringent for security exceptions. The WTO adjudicatory bodies have not
extended this test to measures under Article XXI. As explained above, the test articulated for
Article XXI by the panel in Russia  Traffic in Transit is much less stringent than the test of least
restrictive alternatives developed by the WTO adjudicatory bodies for Article XX.


       29. Essential security interests relate to the State’s most vital interests. Concerns relating to
national security are more sensitive than many other public concerns. In the Mutual Assistance in
Criminal Matters case, the Court acknowledged that security exception clauses give States “wide

sensitive context of national security, it is for the national authorities of a State to make the initial
assessment of the existence of a risk and what is necessary to respond to that risk. An international
court should be wary of substituting itself for the State to override the latter’s decisions ex post facto.
On the other hand, it is the function of an international court to prevent abuse by reviewing a measure
taken by a State with a view to ensuring that discretion is exercised reasonably and in good faith 32.


      30. Based on these considerations, I am of the view that, in assessing whether a measure is
necessary to protect a State’s essential security interests under a clause which does not contain the

phrase “which it considers” or a similar expression, such as Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity,
an international court should determine whether the measure was rational in light of a consideration
of the reasonably available alternatives known to that State at the time. In making this evaluation, it
should take into account the importance of the security interests at stake, and appraise the
contribution the measure was designed to make towards the protection of those interests and its
effectiveness in this regard, as well as its impact on commerce, investment, trade and the like. In
addition, the court should ascertain whether the State followed proper procedures in exercising its

       31. While Article XX (1) (d) of the Treaty of Amity gives the invoking State a fair measure of
discretion, I agree with the Court that in the present case the United States “has not convincingly

(Judgment, para. 108).


       32. In this regard, I take particular note of the following. The United States identifies its
essential security interests as “preventing terrorist attacks and the financing of terrorist activities . . .
and halting the advancement of Iran’s ballistic missile program”. EO 13599 implements the
requirements of Section 1245 (c) of the 2012 NDAA. Whereas Section 1245 refers to a report of the
Treasury stating that “Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector . . . as posing terrorist

EO 13599 indicates, as the purpose of the measures, the “deceptive practices” of the Iranian banking
sector “to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties”, “the deficiencies in Iran’s anti-money
laundering regime and the weaknesses in its implementation”, and “the continuing and unacceptable
risk posed to the international financial system”, but does not mention the security interests of the
United States. EO 13599 mainly affected the assets of Bank Markazi at issue in the Peterson case,
which are outside the Court’s jurisdiction. Other assets affected by EO 13599, notably the assets of
Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, had been blocked before 2012 pursuant to other decisions made under
the authority of Executive Order 13382 of 2005. EO 13599 does not establish a régime of
individualized measures; it applies generally to all Iranian financial institutions. Whereas the

this Executive Order is broader in scope than what was called for in the relevant resolutions.

of the Treaty of Amity to provide “the most constant protection and security” to the property of
Iranian companies. It maintains that the obligation is not limited to protection against physical harm
but also includes legal protection (see Judgment, paras. 170-171).


      34. Treaties use different terms to refer to this standard: “constant protection”; “full
protection”; “continuous protection”; adding “security” before or after “protection”; adding “the
most” before the adjective, and so forth. Tribunals have not considered these variations as having
any substantial significance 34. The standard is commonly referred to as “full protection and security”.

       35. This standard has traditionally been understood as protection from physical harm. AAPL v.
Sri Lanka (1990), the first investment arbitration case brought under an international investment
agreement, was also the first case which addressed this standard. Sri Lankan security forces had
destroyed a shrimp farm during a counter-insurgency operation. This case thus concerned protection
from physical harm 35. The standard of full protection and security was subsequently applied by other
arbitral tribunals in situations where the investment was affected by physical violence 36.


       36. At the beginning of this century, however, some arbitral tribunals started to consider that

Nonetheless, these tribunals have differed in the degree to which they have broadened the scope of
the standard 37.


       37. On the other hand, other arbitral tribunals have continued to maintain that the standard
refers only to protection from physical harm 38. For example, the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic
(2006) stated that “the ‘full security and protection’ clause is not meant to cover just any kind of
impairment of an investor’s investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an

found it “inappropriate to depart from the originally understood standard of ‘protection and constant
security’” 40. The tribunal in Suez and Vivendi v. Argentina (2010) carried out a detailed analysis of
the standard, including its historical development. It then pointed out that “an overly extensive
interpretation of the full protection and security standard may result in an overlap with the other
standards of investment protection, which is neither necessary nor desirable”, concluding that “this
Tribunal is not persuaded that it needs to depart from the traditional interpretation given to this
term” 41.


      38. In support of the proposition that the standard includes legal protection, Iran refers to the

United States. Iran points out that the Chamber’s examination was made on the basis of the

was not the plant and equipment the subject of the requisition, but the entity of ELSI itself” 42.
However, this does not mean that the Chamber applied the standard as requiring more than protection
from physical harm. The Chamber simply did not rule on this point.


       39. In the present case, the Court makes a number of important statements with respect to the
standard of full protection and security. In particular, it observes that the “core” of the standard
“concerns the protection of property from physical harm”, and emphasizes that this standard “is of
particular significance and relevance in the form of protection of property from physical harm by

“to exercise due diligence” in providing protection from physical harm within its territory. It notes
that FCN treaties and international investment agreements often provide for fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security “consecutively or even in the same sentence”, and
considers that “[t]hese two separate standards” would overlap significantly if the full protection and
security standard were interpreted to include legal protection (Judgment, para. 190). Accordingly,
the Court concludes that the provision relating to the full protection and security standard was not
intended to apply to situations covered by the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment
(para. 191) and unanimously rejects Iran’s submission in this respect (para. 236 (9)).

legal protection would make this standard similar to the standard of fair and equitable treatment.
Indeed, some tribunals have considered that full protection and security is absorbed in fair and
equitable treatment 43. Triggered by the recent tendency to expand full protection and security beyond
physical protection, some treaties have expressly limited the standard to protection from physical
harm 44. In order to avoid an overlap between separate standards, full protection and security is better
understood as providing for protection different from fair and equitable treatment. Unless the relevant
treaty expressly provides otherwise, full protection and security should be interpreted as referring to
protection from physical harm.
