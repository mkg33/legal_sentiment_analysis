examining the relatively narrow question of whether paragraph 153 (9) of
Avena creates a direct obligation on state and local officials in the United
States to provide review and reconsideration, or whether it creates an
international obligation which is subject to domestic implementation in
the United States according to United States law.

   8. Furthermore, in interpreting the first dispute, the Court could have
agreed that the efforts to carry out review and reconsideration must be
effective in order to be in compliance with Avena. Indeed, even without

     nationals referred to in subparagraphs (4), (5), (6) and (7) of para-
     graph 153 of the Avena Judgment have had their convictions and
     sentences reviewed and reconsidered, by taking account of Article 36
     of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and paragraphs 138
     to 141 of the Avena Judgment, the United States has not complied
     with the obligation incumbent upon it” (para. 55).

The Court has found that the obligation will only be met when the
United States, by means of its own choosing, has in fact carried out
review and reconsideration of the convictions at issue in Avena, and that
the United States has not yet met its obligations under the Judgment.

   9. With regard to the second dispute, the Court could have reached
the conclusion that the obligation of result imposed by paragraph 153 (9)
is subject to domestic implementation, as the Court had indicated that
the United States should carry out review and reconsideration “by means
of its own choosing”. This necessarily implies that the United States has
a choice of means as to how to implement its obligation under the Judg-
ment.
   10. In the light of the above considerations, in this case where the
question of whether a dispute exists regarding the scope and meaning of




paragraph 153 (9) of Avena, and based on the Court’s jurisprudence, the
Court could have found a dispute to exist between the Parties. However,

Rojas, dont l’exécution capitale rend à présent sans objet cette obligation
en ce qui le concerne, il est clair que pour les autres condamnés les Etats-
Unis restent tenus de se conformer à l’arrêt de la Cour, pour autant qu’ils
ne s’y seraient pas déjà conformés dans le cas de certains d’entre eux,
question que la Cour n’était pas appelée à trancher et n’a pas entendu
trancher. Par ailleurs, il est exact que les Etats-Unis, par la voix de leurs
représentants qualifiés devant la Cour, ont réaffirmé leur engagement à
tout mettre en œuvre pour que ceux des condamnés qui n’ont pas encore
reçu la « réparation appropriée » définie au point 9) du dispositif de
l’arrêt Avena en bénéficient dans les meilleurs délais, et il n’y a pas de
doute que la Cour ne peut qu’en prendre note avec intérêt.
   Ce n’est donc pas parce que je serais en désaccord avec le contenu des
propositions qui figurent au point 3) que j’ai voté contre. C’est parce que
ces énoncés outrepassent manifestement les limites de la compétence que
la Cour tient de l’article 60 du Statut, et qu’elle exerce, ou est supposée
exercer, en la présente espèce. Cette compétence a pour seul objet l’inter-
prétation de l’arrêt précédemment rendu, et ne saurait englober quelque
question que ce soit se rapportant à l’exécution dudit arrêt, soit pour le
passé, soit pour l’avenir.
   C’est d’ailleurs bien ce que dit la Cour lorsqu’elle rejette la demande du
Mexique tendant à ce qu’elle constate que les Etats-Unis ont violé l’arrêt

tions ne peuvent être que simultanément vraies — parce que cette demande
ne saurait se rattacher, ni directement ni incidemment, à la compétence
qu’elle tient de l’article 60.
   Le même raisonnement aurait dû conduire la Cour à s’abstenir d’intro-
duire dans le dispositif de l’arrêt des constatations — aussi indiscutables
soient-elles — telles que celles qui figurent au point 3).
   Une chose est de faire figurer dans les motifs d’un arrêt des remarques,
constatations ou propositions juridiquement superfétatoires et pouvant
apparaître comme dépassant les strictes limites de la compétence qu’exerce
la Cour. Ce n’est jamais de très bonne méthode, mais il se peut que la
Cour trouve parfois des raisons d’ordre pédagogique de procéder ainsi.
Cela peut être acceptable, à condition que ce soit fait avec modération et
discernement (comme ici, par exemple, aux paragraphes 54 et 55).
   Autre chose, en tout cas, est de faire figurer dans le dispositif d’un arrêt
des constatations outrepassant les limites de la compétence que la Cour
met en œuvre. Car, alors que ceux des motifs qui présentent un caractère
surabondant sont dépourvus de l’autorité de la chose jugée, tout ce qui
figure dans le dispositif d’un arrêt est en principe res judicata. Il peut y
avoir des motifs surabondants, il ne devrait pas y avoir de mention sura-

jamais évoqué la moindre contestation relative aux effets dans le temps
dudit arrêt, qui pût appeler une interprétation.
   En réalité, le point 3) apparaît plutôt comme une sorte de préambule
au point 4), par lequel la Cour rejette la demande mexicaine tendant à ce
que soient exigées des Etats-Unis des garanties de non-répétition (de la
violation de l’arrêt Avena). C’est à la lumière des constatations du
point 3) (« dans ces conditions ») que la Cour rejette cette demande au
point suivant.
   Mais, à mon avis, ce qui justifie le rejet du chef de conclusions que la




Cour écarte, à juste titre, au point 4) du dispositif, ce n’est pas que les
Etats-Unis aient pris l’engagement de se conformer pleinement, désor-
mais, à l’arrêt Avena, c’est que ce chef de conclusions est lui-même étran-
ger à la compétence découlant de l’article 60 du Statut, la seule invoquée
en l’espèce par le Mexique.
  Ayant voté contre le point 3), pour les raisons que je viens d’exposer, je
n’ai cependant pas cru devoir voter aussi contre le point 4), bien qu’il
comporte à mes yeux un renvoi fâcheux au point précédent ; l’essentiel
étant, pour moi, qu’il rejette la demande que la Cour ne pouvait accueillir.

   J’ajouterai, pour conclure, que les observations qui précèdent ne met-
tent nullement en cause mon adhésion à l’essentiel de l’arrêt que la Cour
vient de rendre et qui se trouve, selon moi, aux paragraphes 29 à 46 des
motifs, et au point 1) du dispositif.

     DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE SEPU
                                    u LVEDA-AMOR



  Agreement with most of the reasoning and most of the decisions — Regret
that Court did not settle issues incontrovertibly characterized by a degree of
opacity — Implicit recognition by the Court that a dispute exists — Interpre-
tation of obligation of result as one which requires specific outcome and within
reasonable period of time — Failing success, need for alternative and effective
means, such as legislative action — Medellín was executed without the required
review and reconsideration — The Court finds that the United States has
breached its obligations — But there is no determination of the legal conse-
quences flowing from this breach — The Avena Judgment remains binding.

   Article 36 confers individual rights — Mexico and the United States hold dif-
ferent views — The procedural default rule has not been revised — Non-applica-
tion of procedural default rule is required to allow review and reconsideration to
become operative — Binding force of the Judgment — United States Supreme
Court’s ruling is at odds with the one provided by Mexico and by the United
States — The Court should have settled the issue raised by the conflicting inter-
pretations — Review and reconsideration received by only one Mexican national
out of 51 listed in the Avena Judgment — The obligation falls upon all state and
federal authorities — Importance of role played by the judicial system, espe-

States Governor is under the obligation to act in conformity with United States
undertakings — In the present case, all competent organs and all constituent
subdivisions must comply with mandated review and reconsideration, as Mexico
claims — Interpretation of the dispute by the Court would have rendered an
invaluable construction to the clarification of rules and its enforcement.



   1. I am in agreement with most of the reasoning of the Court in the
present Judgment, as well as with most of the decisions expressed in the
operative clause of the Judgment. It is with regret that I am unable to
join the Court in some of its conclusions. My regret stems not only from
my disagreement with some of these views, but also from my belief that
the Court has missed a splendid opportunity to settle issues calling for
interpretation and to construe the meaning or scope of the Avena Judg-
ment in certain respects incontrovertibly characterized by a degree of
opacity.
   2. Before I embark on the process of setting out and explaining my
points of disagreement with the Judgment, I believe it useful to revisit
some of the important considerations that the Court has found worthy
of stating ; to a large extent, these follow from an interpretation of the




Avena Judgment. In the present Judgment, the Court has clearly estab-
lished what is meant by an obligation of result : it is “an obligation
which requires a specific outcome” (Judgment, paragraph 27). It is clear
that an obligation falls upon the United States to provide the Mexican
nationals named in the Avena Judgment who remain on death row with
review and reconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 of the
Avena Judgment. But then the Court construes the scope of the obliga-
tion :
       “The Court observes that this obligation of result is one which
     must be met within a reasonable period of time. Even serious efforts
     of the United States, should they fall short of providing review and
     reconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 of the Avena
     Judgment, would not be regarded as fulfilling this obligation of
     result.” (Para. 27 ; emphasis added.)
  3. If the obligation of result is one which “must be met within a rea-
sonable period of time”, then there has been a failure by the United

     arguments it presented, in particular in its further written explana-
     tions.” (Ibid., paragraph 41 ; emphasis added.)
   6. The fact is that the Judgment comes close to recognizing that there
is a “dispute”, “contestation”, or “desacuerdo”, as the term is translated
in the Spanish version of Article 60 of the Statute. Whether or not
Mexico complied with Article 98, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court,
which states that “the precise point or points in dispute as to the meaning
or scope of the judgment shall be indicated”, is a question requiring
further consideration, which it will receive later in this dissenting opinion.

  7. In the present Judgment, the Court further construes the meaning
and scope of the Avena Judgment when it states that
     “considerations of domestic law which have so far hindered the imple-
     mentation of the obligation incumbent upon the United States, can-
     not relieve it of its obligation. A choice of means was allowed to the
     United States in the implementation of its obligation and, failing
     success within a reasonable period of time through the means chosen,
     it must rapidly turn to alternative and effective means of attaining
     that result.” (Ibid., paragraph 47 ; emphasis added.)

As the United States Supreme Court has ruled, the alternative and effec-
tive means rapidly to implement the obligation of result incumbent on
the United States is through legislative action : “The responsibility for
transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing




treaty into domestic law falls to Congress” (Medellín v. Texas, 128 S. Ct.
1346, 1368 (2008), attached as Annex B, p. 60, of Mexico’s Request
for Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case concern-
ing Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of
America) (Mexico v. United States of America)).
   8. The means available to the United States is essentially legislative
action, preferably at the federal level, quickly to attain effective compli-
ance with the obligation. As the Permanent Court of International Jus-

       contrary to what was directed by the Court in its Order indicating
       provisional measures of 16 July 2008” (Judgment, paragraph 52).
In the operative clause of the Judgment, the Court has found unani-
mously that the United States “has breached the obligation incumbent
upon it” under the Court’s Order (ibid., paragraph 61 (2)). The Court
leaves no doubt in its decision that the obligation upon the United States
not to execute the other four Mexican nationals named in the Order of
16 July 2008 “pending review and reconsideration being afforded to them
is fully intact by virtue” of the Avena Judgment itself (ibid., para-
graph 54). In the operative clause of the Judgment, the Court reaffirms
“the continuing binding character of the obligations of the United States

ment indicates in paragraph 52. Yet the Court has not found it necessary
even to mention in the present Judgment the commitments assumed by
the Agent of the United States through his recognition : that Mr. Medel-
lín’s execution would constitute a violation of an international obliga-
tion ; that it would be inconsistent with the Avena Judgment ; that the
United States was responsible under international law for the actions of
its political subdivisions ; and that the responsibility of the United States
would be engaged, under the principles of State responsibility, for the
internationally wrongful acts of federal, state and local officials.
   13. It is to be deeply regretted that the Court has decided not to pass
judgment on a failure by the United States to discharge an international
obligation. It is difficult to understand and accept this forbearance, espe-
cially when the United States Agent himself has recognized that a breach
of its international obligations entails the responsibility of the State he
represents. By refraining from attributing any legal significance to a vio-
lation of the Avena Judgment and of the Order of 16 July 2008, the Court




has let pass an opportunity to further the development of the law of State
responsibility and has ignored the need to adjudge the consequences of
the internationally wrongful acts of a State and to determine the remedial
action required in such circumstances.

(Judgment, paragraph 60). It is to be hoped that the United States Con-
gress will enact legislation so as to comply with the decision of the Court.
In the absence of federal legislation, the obligations stipulated in the
Avena Judgment will become a mere abstraction, devoid of any legal sub-
stance. In the words of the United States Supreme Court,
       “The Avena judgment creates an international law obligation on
     the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding
     domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sources — the
     Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute — creates
     binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation and
     no such legislation has been enacted.” (Medellín v. Texas,
     128 S. Ct. 1346 (2008), Syllabus ; attached as Annex B to the Appli-
     cation, p. 44.)


                 I. DISPUTE/CONTESTATION/DESACUERDO

   15. In order properly to ascertain whether there is a “dispute”/“con-
testation”/“desacuerdo” for purposes of Article 60 of the Statute, it is
necessary to consider the wider perspective of the litigation between the
United States and Mexico. The legal proceedings have involved federal
and state authorities, particularly the Executive branches of government
at the federal and state levels, as well as federal and state courts.
   16. The Avena Judgment clearly applies broadly to all Mexican nation-


   18. In the Amicus Curiae Brief in support of Sanchez-Llamas as pet-
itioner for the writ of certiorari before the United States Supreme Court,
Mexico emphatically stated :

     “the Avena Judgment reaffirmed in the clearest possible terms that
     Article 36 of the Vienna Convention confers individual rights on all
     Mexican nationals who are detained or arrested in the United States”
     (Brief Amicus Curiae of the Government of the United Mexican
     States in support of Petitioner 3, 4, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon,
     126 S. Ct 2669 (2006) ; emphasis added).

To support its contention, Mexico resorts to paragraph 40 of the Avena
Judgment : the individual rights of Mexican nationals “are rights which
are to be asserted, at any rate in the first place, within the domestic legal
system of the United States” (Avena and Other Mexican Nationals
(Mexico v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004
(I), p. 35, para. 40).
   19. To strengthen its argument in the Sanchez-Llamas case, Mexico
cited what the United States had pleaded before the Court in the Tehran
case. There, the United States argued that Article 36 “establishes rights . . .
for the nationals of the sending State who are assured access to consular
officers and through them to others” (I.C.J. Pleadings, United States
Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.
Iran), 1979, p. 174 ; emphasis added).

   20. It is clear that the United States holds a different view in the
Sanchez-Llamas case on the question of individual rights conferred by
Article 36 of the Convention. In its Brief to the United States Supreme
Court, the United States asserted that the principle that the United States
Supreme Court “should give ‘respectful consideration’ to an interna-
tional court’s interpretation of a treaty does not lead to the conclusion




that Article 36 affords an individual a right to challenge his conviction
and sentence” (Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting
Respondents, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. 2669 (2006), p. 28 ;
emphasis added).

   21. But the Amicus Curiae Brief for the United States not only con-
tradicts the Mexican view ; it also strongly challenges the interpretations
handed down by the International Court of Justice in the LaGrand and
Avena cases. In the words of the Brief,

        “The United States has no obligation to accept the reasoning under-
