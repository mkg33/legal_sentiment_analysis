T agree with the decision of the Court that it has jurisdiction
to hear the present cases on the merits and that the four preliminary
objections are not well founded and should be dismissed. Since,
however, the Opinion of the Court does not embrace all the questions
of fact and of law which I find essential to reaching the decision, I
find it my duty to deliver this separate Opinion.

The nature of the international obligations assumed by a Man-
datory in accepting a Mandate, and specifically, the nature of those
obligations assumed by the Respondent in accepting the Mandate
for South West Africa, is a focal point in the decision of the juris-
dictional issues in these cases. In my view, it is not possible to
understand the nature of those obligations without a thorough
appreciation of the principal facts prefacing and attending the
finalization of the Mandate. These facts, as now available in pub-
lished official records, have hitherto not been adequately presented.
Accordingly, without repeating much that is familiar in the history
of the Mandates, I shall summarize and comment on those facts
which seem to me to be essential to an analysis of the obligations
of the Mandatory for South West Africa.

At this point the Mandatory was bound by an international ob-
ligation to France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, to accept the
Mandate for South West: Africa, to exercise it according to the
agreed terms, and to submit to the jurisdiction of the Permanent
Court disputes with other Members of the League concerning the
interpretation or application of the Mandate. This agreement was
subject to two conditions subsequent: (1) approval by Japan;
(2) confirmation by the Council of the League. Both of these
conditions were subsequently fulfilled and the international agree-
ment, with certain agreed amendments, was then perfected.

The Council of the League of Nations on 5 August 1920 adopted
the report prepared by M. Hymans of Belgium on ‘The Obligations
of the League of Nations under Article 22 of the Covenant (Man-
dates)”. This report was designed in part to clarify the respective
roles of the Council and the Assembly of the League in regard to
Mandates, but it constitutes the basic document concerning the
respective roles of the Council of the League on the one hand and
the Principal Allied Powers on the other. It will be recalled that
France, Great Britain, Japan and Belgium, namely the four States
which accepted Mandates—Great Britain acting in several capacities
—were at this time Members of the Council of the League. In



adopting the Hymans Report, the Council of the League approved.
inter alia, the following conclusions:

1. There was no disagreement that the right to allocate the
Mandates belonged to the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in
whose favour Germany had renounced its rights in its overseas
possessions.

2. Although the Mandatory was thus appointed by the Principal
Powers it was to govern in the name of the League. “It logically
follows that the legal title held by the Mandatory Power must be
a double one: one conferred by the Principal Powers and the other
conferred by the League of Nations.”

3. On the question “By whom shall the terms of the Mandates
be determined ?’’ the report said:

“It has not been sufficiently noted that the question is only
partially solved by paragraph 8 of Article 22, according to which
the degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised
by the Mandatory, if not defined by a previous convention, shall be
explicitly defined by the Council.”

The report continued that most Mandates would contain many
provisions other than those relating to the degree of authority. It
said that the B and C Mandates must be submitted ‘‘for the approval
of the Council”. In the light of paragraph 6 of Article 22 of the
Covenant, it concluded that “it is not indispensable that C Mandates
should contain any stipulation whatever regarding the degree of
authority or administration”.

4. The report discussed the meaning of “Members of the League”
as used in paragraph 8 of Article 22. It concluded that this term
could not be taken literally because if it were it would mean that
the Assembly of the League would have to determine the terms of
the Mandates since only the Assembly brought all the Members
together; if the drafters had meant to refer to the Assembly, they
“would have mentioned it by name, rather than used an obscure
periphrasis”. The report concluded that when the Article was
drafted it was supposed that conventions dealing with Mandates
would be included in the Peace Treaty and that only the Allied
and Associated Powers would be original Members of the League.
The term “Members of the League” in paragraph 8 of Article 22
was thus intended to refer to all the signatories, except Germany,
of the Treaty of Versailles. Practically, the report recommended
that the Council ask the Powers to inform the Council of the terms
they proposed for the Mandates.

Hymans on the question of Mandates.



This Report stated:

“With regard to Mandates B and C, it appears that the Principal
Powers are in agreement on many points, but that there are
differences of opinion as to the interpretation of certain of the
provisions of Article 22, and that the negotiations have not yet
been concluded.

Beyond doubt, if is in every way desirable that the Principal
Powers should be able to arrive at a complete understanding and to
submit agreements to the League. Failing this very desirable agreement
however, the Covenant provides for the intervention of the Council
with a view to determining the degree of authority, of control or of
administration to be exercised by the Mandatories.”

... “We sincerely hope therefore that before the end of the
Assembly the Principal Powers will have succeeded in settling by
common agreement the terms of the Mandates which they wish to
submit to the Council.” (Italics supplied.)

The difference of opinion to which the Report referred, in the

Council in establishing the Mandates. The Prime Minister of Great
Britain said in the House of Commons on 26 July 1920 (when asked
“Do the Great Powers submit Mandates to the League of Nations?
Is submission the real attitude?”’): “The Great Powers are on the
League of Nations, and they are only submitting to themselves.”
Again, on 8 November 1920 when asked whether “the right to
determine the terms of the Mandate reposes in the Members of the
League”, the Prime Minister answered in the negative and later
stated: “The Great Powers are represented, of course, on the Council
of the League, and these Mandates have to be submitted to the
Council of the League. It will require the unanimous consent of
the Council of the League to reject them ... Nothing can be don.
except by a unanimous decision of the Council. That means that
nothing can be done without the consent of the Powers concerned.”
The question was then put: “Is it not definitely laid down by the
Treaty of Versailles that the degree of authority and control to
be exercised by any Mandatory in a mandatory area is a matter
for the League of Nations, Council or Assembly, to decide?”
The Prime Minister replied: “Yes, subject to the conditions which
I have already indicated.” (Italics supplied.)

At the private session of the Council on 4 August 1920, M.
Bourgeois (France) pointed out that:
“the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, at the moment when

the Covenant was drafted, had, in using the phrase ‘Members of the
League’, in effect intended to refer to themselves.”



In a discussion on the Mandate drafts in the Council of the
League on 10 December 1920, the Representative of Italy said
that, strictly speaking, by the terms of Article 22 (8) of the Covenant,
no drafts of A Mandates had been brought to the notice of the Coun-
cil since they had not yet been communicated to Italy “and,
consequently, there was, as yet, no agreement in regard to the
matter between the Principal Allied Powers”. He referred to the
“necessity of an agreement between the Principal Allied Powers,
as provided for by Article 22”. (Italics supplied.)

On 10 December 1920 the Council of the League “declared afresh
that it was its duty to see that the rules laid down in Article 22
were carried out and especially that it was competent to approve
the terms of the Mandates and, in the last resort, if need be, to
draw up the terms”.

These salient facts, against the familiar background of the origins
of the Mandate System, lead to the following conclusions:

1. The decision of the Council of Four on 7 May, 1919, allocating
the Mandate for South West Africa to the Union of South Africa,
constituted the first link in what may be called the chain of title.
This “decision” was an international agreement between France,
Great Britain, Italy, the United States and the Union of South
Africa (represented by Great Britain} which had dispositive effect.
Japan subsequently concurred in or adhered to this agreement.

2. Since the allocation of a Mandate was not equivalent to a
cession of territory and did not transfer sovereignty to the Manda-
tory, it remained to determine what would be the rights and duties
of the Mandatory in its capacity as such. Article 22 of the Covenant,
by which all the States concerned were soon to be bound, indicated
the general nature of these rights and duties.

3. By 24 December 1919 agreement had been reached among
France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, on the one hand, and
the Union of South Africa represented by Great Britain, on the
other hand, on the terms of the Mandate, except for one unsettled
reservation of Japan. The agreed terms which were unaffected
by the Japanese reservation included a provision for the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

4. By December 1920 it had become clear that the United
States had disassociated itself from the Peace Treaty settlements
and from the League of Nations, which fact altered the form, but
not the fact of agreement on the terms of the Mandate for South
West Africa.

The Council immediately referred this draft to the Secretariat
to be studied by the experts. As appears from subsequent reports
by Viscount Ishii, the Secretariat was concerned to make sure that
the proposed terms conformed to Article 22 of the Covenant and
that the role of the Council of the League should be appropriately
recognized. As stated by Viscount Ishii, what is now the fourth
paragraph of the preamble was inserted

“to define clearly the relations which, under the terms of the
Covenant, should exist between the League of Nations and the
Council on the one hand, and the Mandatory Power on the other”.

Along the same lines, the one line following the preamble in the
Balfour draft was replaced by the phrase which appears in the
final text, namely:

“Confirming the said Mandate, defines its terms as follows:

The fourth paragraph of the preamble, as inserted by the League
Secretariat, is capable of misconstruction. The English text,
as it appears in the final version of the Mandate, reads as follows:

“Whereas, by the aforementioned Article 22, paragraph 8, it is
provided that the degree of authority, control or administration to



be exercised by the Mandatory not having been previously agreed
upon by the Members of the League, shall be explicitly defined by
the Council of the League of Nations:”

It will be seen that this text slightly paraphrases the text of
paragraph 8 of Article 22 of the Covenant. On the other hand,
the French text follows the text of paragraph 8 of Article 22
more. closely and, in doing so, brings out more clearly the condi-
tion subject to which the Council was authorized to act.

The French text reads as follows:

“Considérant que, aux termes de I’Article 22 ci-dessus mentionné,
paragraphe 8, il est prévu que si le degré d'autorité, de contrôle ou
d’administration à exercer par le Mandataire n’a pas fait l’objet
d’une Convention antérieure entre les Membres de la Société, il sera
expressément statué sur ces points par le Conseil :””

Moreover, in the English text of the Ishii report, the phrase
“not having been previously agreed upon by Members of the League”
is set off by commas, thus affording a construction which, in
English, may also be conditional. The use of the comma after
the word “Mandatory” is to be found in the Mandates for Syria,
Lebanon, Palestine, Belgian East Africa, British East Africa,
and the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, but it has dropped
out in the texts of the Mandates for the Pacific Islands south of
the Equator, for Samoa and for Nauru and for South West Africa.

If the fourth paragraph of the Preamble is read as an assertion
that the Members of the League had not previously agreed upon the
terms of the Mandate, given the interpretation which the Council
and its Members were currently giving to the expression ‘Members
of the League”, the assertion would be not only contrary to the
historical facts but to the recital of those facts in paragraphs two
and three of the Preamble. Moreover, it is perfectly clear from the
record that it was the Principal Powers and not the Council which
“explicitly defined” the terms of the Mandate, including those
terms which alone the Council, under stated conditions, was author-
ized by paragraph 8 of Article 22 to define.

This whole fourth paragraph of the Preamble is omitted entirely
from the four Mandates for Togo and the Cameroons which had a
different development. At the meeting of the Council of Four
on 7 May 1919, when the decision was taken to allocate the Man-
dates, it was agreed that the British and French Governments
would make a joint recommendation to the League as to the future
of the former colgnies of Togo and the Cameroons; at this point
there was no decision to place these territories under Mandate.
But the Joint Recommendation of the two Governments to the
League on 17 December 1920 proposed a division of the two colo-
nies between France and Great Britain and, in accordance with



the spirit of Article 22, that they be placed under Mandates. The
two Governments accordingly sent to the Council four draft Man-
dates which are similar to the other B Mandates. The Joint Recom-
mendation says that the two Governments ‘‘venture to hope that
when the Council has taken note of them it will consider that the
drafts have been prepared in conformity with the principles laid
down in the said Article 22, and will approve them accordingly”.

Appended to the drafts were signed agreements on the delimi-
tation of the frontiers; the fact that these agreements were signed
and that there was no explicit signed statement saying “The
undersigned agree to the terms of the Mandates which we are jointly
recommending’, is of no juridical consequence. When the Council of
the League approved these four drafts on 1 August 1922, it did not
insert the new fourth paragraph of the Preamble although it did
insert the final one-line phrase. If it had been the understanding
that under Article 22 of the Covenant the Council actually had to
define all the terms of the Mandates in the absence of prior agree-
ment by all the Members of the League, and if the fourth paragraph
of the Preamble as it appears, infer alia, in the Mandate for South
West Africa, is to be so understood, it would be impossible to explain
why these four Mandates were subject to a different rule. The second
paragraph of the Preamble of these four Mandates recites. that the
Principal Allied and Associated Powers had “agreed” that France
and Great Britain should make a joint recommendation concerning
these former colonies and this was evidently treated as an agreement
of the Powers in advance to accept whatever recommendation the
two governments might make. This conclusion is borne out by the
Treaties of 13 February 1923 between the United States and France
concerning the rights of the former in French Cameroons and Togo;
they refer to the agreement of the four Powers upon these Mandates,
just as the Treaty of 1x February 1922 between the United States
and Japan concerning rights in the islands under Japanese Mandate
recites the prior agreement of the same four Powers on the allocation
of the Mandate and on its terms.

graph of Article 7 was amended so as to eliminate the idea of a
majority vote since the Council had in other connections decided
that it should always act by unanimity.

8r


The second paragraph of Article 7 was recast in what became its
final form so that its opening phrases read:

“The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should arise
between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of
Nations...”

On the other hand, the text in the Balfour draft said: “If any
dispute whatever should arise between the Members of the League of
Nations...”’, which was the language of the text approved in the
Milner Commission in July, 1910.

Viscount Ishii explained that this change was inspired by the
thought that the Members of the League, other than the Mandatory
“could not be forced against their will to submit their difficulties to
the Permanent Court”.

The various amendments thus suggested by the League Secretar-
iat were accepted by the Council. The representative of Japan made
a declaration that Japan had no objection to the C Mandates and the
Council accordingly approved them. In so far as the Mandate for
South West Africa is concerned, this approval is registered in the
familiar resolution of 17 December 1920. This may be called the
second link in the chain of title.

It may be remarked that this resolution was adopted by the
Council on the day following that on which the Protocol of Signature
of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice
was opened for signature and was then signed, inter alia, on behalf
of all of the governments which subsequently became Mandatories,
although the signature for the Union of South Africa was under
reserve of the approval of the Government of that country.

It is apparent that the Council of the League did not “define”
the terms of the Mandate in the sense of originating a definition or
specification thereof; it “defined’’ them only in the sense of making
them “definite” through the Council's stamp of approval on the
drafts which had been agreed upon by the Principal Powers.

The actual course of events was correctly summarized on 21 Feb-
ruary 1927 by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, responding
to a question in the House of Commons:

“Under Article 119 of the Treaty of Versailles the former German
territories in Africa were surrendered to the Principal Allied and
Associated Powers who, in accordance with Article 22 of the Treaty
agreed that the Mandates to administer these territories should be
conferred upon the Government concerned; and proposed the terms
in which the Mandates should be formulated. Having arranged the
allocation and delimitation of these territories as between them-
selves, the Governments concerned agreed to accept their respective
Mandates and to exercise them on behalf of the League of Nations on



the proposed terms, ‘and the Mandates were then confirmed by the
Council of the League... ” (Italics supplied.)

The Council, as is apparent from the fourth paragraph of the Pre-
amble of its resolution of 17 December 1920, purported to take its
action under the authority of paragraph 8 of Article 22 of the Cov-
enant. But Article 7 of the Mandate, with its compromissory clause,
was outside the scope of paragraph 8 which relates only to the
‘degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by
the Mandatory”. Indeed Article 22 of the Covenant contains no
reference to the Permanent Court. Article 7 at least—whatever one
may say of the other Articles—stems from the agreement of the
Principal Powers and the Mandatory and the resolution of the
Council of the League of 17 December 1920 records the agreement.

The Mandate, as an international institution of the type contem-
plated in Article 22 of the Covenant, was a novelty in international
law and it is not surprising that the agreements which were framed
to give life to the institution present complex aspects. It is the task
of the Court, not to construct some ideal legal pattern which might
have been followed, but to appreciate the facts. Ex factis ius oritur.
It is not irrelevant to recall that legal difficulties were encountered
also in the establishment of the Trusteeship System, which, under
Chapter XII of the Charter of the United Nations, was designed to
supersede the Mandates System under the League of Nations. Just
as the text of Article 22 of the Covenant seemed on its face to
envisage an agreement by all Members of the League, so Article 79
of the Charter provides that “The terms of trusteeship for each
territory ... shall be agreed upon by the States directly concerned ...”
The fact that it was impossible to reach agreement on the identifi-
cation of ‘States directly concerned’ is part of a familiar story. The
General Assembly accordingly approved by resolution the terms of
trusteeships without there having been strict compliance with this
requirement of Article 79 of the Charter. The reality of the existence
of “trusteeship agreements”, however, can scarcely be questioned.

In the light of this record, it is possible to describe the multifarious
international obligations assumed by the Respondent as Mandatory
for South West Africa.

1. The Mandatory had obligations under the Covenant of the
League of Nations. As a Member of the League, the Mandatory, as
soon as it accepted a Mandate, became bound by those provisions of
Article 22 of the Covenant which specify or indicate the nature
of a Mandatory’s obligation. Paragraph 7 of Article 22, for example,
imposed the specific obligation to render an annual report; it is
possible to consider Article 6 of the Council's resolution of December
17, 1920, as merely giving specificity to this obligation. Paragraphs 1
and 2 of Article 22, supplemented by the general obligations under
Article 23, indicate the general nature of the obligations flowing
from the “sacred trust”, and again it is possible to consider Articles 2



through 5 of the resolution of 17 December 1920 as filling in the
precise details of these obligations. But in both these instances, the.
“details” were subjects of further agreement outside the Covenant.

The obligations owed by a Mandatory under Article 22 of the
Covenant, like those obligations owed by all Members of the League
under such Articles as 10 and 16 of the Covenant, were owed to
the co-contractors, that is to all other Members of the League.
I do not find it necessary to consider at this point whether these
particular obligations, under the Covenant, were owed also to the
collectivity, that is to the League of Nations itself. I shall discuss
later the position of the inhabitants of the Mandated territory.

2. The Mandatory had obligations under the agreements which
it made with the Principal Powers, namely, France, Great Britain,
Italy and Japan. These agreements are recorded in the resolution
of the Council of the League of 17 December 1920.

The first agreement recorded in the second paragraph of the Pre-
amble of the resolution must be recalled, although the Mandatory
may not be considered an original party to it. It reads:

“Whereas the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that,
in accordance with Article 22, Part I (Covenant of the League of
Nations) of the said Treaty, a Mandate should be conferred upon
His Britannic Majesty to be exercised on his behalf by the Govern-
ment of the Union of South Africa to administer the territory
aforementioned...”

This agreement was the decision of the Council of Four of 7 May
1919. The Preamble is here accurate in referring to the ‘Principal
Allied and Associated Powers” since the United States, through
President Wilson, participated in making this basic agreement.
But, as the United States subsequently pointed out, it was incorrect
to use this term in regard to further agreements in which the
United States did not officially participate. I shall hereafter refer
to the “Principal Powers” as including France, Great Britain, Italy
and Japan. The Union of South Africa became a party to this
agreement by the acceptance to be noted in a moment.

The second agreement recorded in the same paragraph is recorded
in these words:

“… and have proposed that the Mandate should be formulated in
the following terms;”

Subject to the correction just noted concerning the United States
which was the “Associated” Power, this means that the Principal
Powers had “proposed” the “following terms” for the Mandate.



Obviously four Powers could not make a proposal jointly without
having agreed upon it, and we know from the historical record that
they had agreed. Again, it may be said that the Union of South
Africa became a party to this agreement by the acceptance which
can now be noted.

The third agreement is recorded in the third paragraph of the
Preamble of the resolution of 17 December 1920, as follows:

“Whereas His Britannic Majesty, for and on behalf of the Govern-
ment of the Union of South Africa, has agreed to accept the Mandate
in respect of the said territory and has undertaken to exercise it
on behalf of the League of Nations in accordance with the following
provisions ;”

This is really a double agreement since it first records the accept-
ance by the Mandatory of the Mandate as allocated in the first
agreement of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, and then
records the acceptance of the second agreement of the Principal
Powers by which the terms of the Mandate were formulated. It is
clear that the words ‘following provisions” in this paragraph of the
Preamble are identical in meaning with the words “following terms”
in the preceding paragraph. As already stated, these two acceptances
may be considered as equivalent to accéssions by the Union of South
Africa to two agreements of the Principal Powers, that is to the
agreement to allocate to the Union (through His Britannic Majesty)
the Mandate for South West Africa, and to the agreement upon the
terms according to which the Mandate was to be exercised.

It may be noted that the term “acceptance”, in accordance with
familiar modern practice, is used here in the sense in which the
term is explained along with “‘accession”, “approval” and other
terms in the 1962 Report of the United Nations International Law
Commission ; according to Article 1 ( d) of the Draft Articles on the
Law of Treaties, these terms “mean in each case the act so named
whereby a State establishes on the international plane its consent
to be bound by a treaty”. The use of the term “treaty” is considered
hereinafter.

It has already been explained how the Council of the League pro-
ceeded by its resolution of 17 December 1920 to confirm and to
make definite the terms of the Mandate which had already been
agreed upon by the Mandatory and the Principal Powers. The
various textual amendments included in the Council resolution
being approved by the Council, acting by unanimity, were thereby
approved by Great Britain speaking in its double capacity. It
could be said, therefore, that the fourth agreement is the entire body
of the Council’s resolution and it is in this sense that the resolution
has generally been treated as being ‘the Mandate”, which has
usually been considered—as it was considered by all parties to these
cases—to be a treaty to which the Mandatory was a party. This
point will be dealt with later.



But the amended text which was adopted for the second para-
graph of Article 7 of the resolution is cast in such a form that it is
justifiable to deal with it separately, perhaps as a fifth agreement.
The paragraphs reads:

“The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should arise
between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of
Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the
provisions of the Mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by
negotiation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the
League of Nations.”

In contrast to the paragraphs of the Preamble which used the
past tense to refer to agreements already concluded, this second
paragraph of Article 7 is cast in the present tense. Its general form
is in the style of declarations to be made under Article 36 (2) of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, by which
States agree to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court;
the provision for reciprocity, while usual, is neither obligatory nor
universal. But it is also similar to a compromissory clause of the
type frequently found in multilateral conventions.

The change in the compromissory clause of Article 7, which was
agreed to by the Powers and the Mandatory, did not modify the
obligation of the Mandatory to submit to the jurisdiction of the
Court, an obligation to which the Mandatory had agreed throughout
the drafting stages from the mid-summer of 1919, and which was
included in the third and fifth agreements recorded in the Council’s
resolution of 17 December 1920. The change in this clause merely
altered the legal situation relative to obligations of other Members
of the League, on whom (as it was thought) the earlier drafts would
have imposed an obligation to submit to the jurisdiction of the
Court without their even having an opportunity to accept or refuse.

The word “mandate” has been used in many different senses—
to indicate an institution, an instrument, a treaty or agreement,
a grant of authority and a territory. In whatever way one identifies
the “mandate”, it can scarcely be doubted that in accepting the
mandate, the Mandatory incurred international obligations of a
legal character and that it voluntarily agreed to incur those obliga-
tions; the obligations were certainly not imposed upon the Manda-
tory, which, under Article 22 (2) of the Covenant, was a State
“willing to accept” them. This béing the case, the next point to
consider is whether the agreement to incur these international
obligations of a legal character is to be characterized as a ‘“treaty
or convention”. The term “treaty or convention” is used in Arti-
cles 36 and 37 of the Statute, but since in recent times there has



been no justification for distinguishing in law between a treaty and
a convention, only the term “treaty” need be used here for purposes
of analysis.

Here again semantic difficulties are encountered, since, as €
Rapporteur of the International Law Commission has pointed out,
in all discussions in the law of treaties there is apt to be confusior
between the instrument in which an agreement is embodied and
the agreement itself. As far back as 1923, a sub-committee of
the League of Nations Committee on the Codification of Interna-
tional Law, referred to “the prevailing anarchy as regards termino-
logy” in the law of treaties. The notion that there is a clear and
ordinary meaning of the word “treaty” is a mirage. The fundamental
question is whether a State has given a promise or undertaking
from which flow international legal rights and duties. This point
of view has been generally accepted in modern codifications of the
law of treaties, such as those of the United Nations International
Law Commission, the Harvard Research in International Law
and the American Law Institute.

In view of what the International Law Commission in its 1962
Report calls the “extraordinarily rich and varied nomenclature”, it
is common ground that the label attached to a treaty is of no legal
significance and that the legal consequences of informal agreements
expressed in a variety of forms may be identical with those re-
sulting from the most formal instruments. (Cf. Lissitzyn, “Efforts
to Codify or Restate the Law of Treaties”, 62 Columbia Law Review
1166 (1962).) In preparing draft codes on the law of treaties, rap-
porteurs have at times pointed out that the draft has for conven-
ience, been limited to apply, for example, only to treaties em-
bodied in written instruments. But the 1962 Report of the Inter-
national Law Commission, like that of 1959, emphasizes that the
fact that the articles do not apply to international agreements not in
written form ‘is not to deny the legal force of oral agreements
under international law”. The 1959 Report explained: “There may
be an international agreement, but there may be no instrument
embodying it—i.e., it is an oral agreement, made for example,
between heads of States or Governments...” (1959 Yearbook of the
International Law Commission, Vol. II, p. 94.)

The recent (1962) draft of the American Law Institute uses the
expression “international agreement” in place of “treaty” and
defines it as ‘‘an agreement between states or international or-
ganizations by which there is manifested an intention to create,
change or define relationships under international law”. The
comment says “there is no rule of international law which prevents
an oral agreement from constituting a binding international
agreement”.

It is also generally recognized that there may be unilateral agree-
ments, meaning agreements arising out of unilateral acts in which
only one party is promisor and may well be the only party bound.



Unilateral contracts of the same character are recognized in some
municipal legal systems. In the United States, for instance: “In
the case of a unilateral contract, there is only one promisor; and
the legal result is that he is the only party who is under an en-
forceable legal duty. The other party to this contract is the one to
whom the promise is made, and he is the only one in whom the
contract creates an enforceable legal right.” The assent of the
promisee is not always required. (Corbin on Contracts (1950), Vol. I,
sec. 21.) The doctrine of “consideration”, which plays so large
a part in Anglo-American contract law, has not been taken over
into the international law of treaties.

Professor Brierly, as Rapporteur on the Law of Treaties for the
International Law Commission, declared:

“International legal rights and obligations may of course arise
otherwise than by agreement between a plurality of persons. They
may thus arise by unilateral act, or as a result of an act to which
the beneficiary of rights created by such act is a stranger... A
possible explanation of the binding force of so-called unilateral
declarations creative of rights against the declarant is to be found in
the theory of presumed consent of the beneficiary.” (1950 Yearbook
of the International Law Commission, Vol. II, p. 227. See also the
report by Lauterpacht as Rapporteur in 1953, ¢6d., Vol. II, pp. 101
ff.)

The points of view just summarized are soundly based on inter-
national practice and on the jurisprudence of the international
courts. A few examples of unilateral and informal agreements may
be cited.

In the Free Zones case the Permanent Court of International
Justice considered that a unilateral manifesto issued by a domestic
Sardinian organ had the character of a treaty stipulation (A/B
No. 46 (1932), p. 145).

In Interpretation of the Statute of the Memel Territory (A/B No. 49),
Lithuania claimed that the Statute of the Memel Territory was a
Lithuanian enactment—but it was annexed to the Convention.
Sir William Malkin, arguing for the United Kingdom (Series C
No. 59, pp. 176-178), stated that, “whatever the form of the
Statute might be, its true juridical nature was that of a treaty and
‘that any question of interpretation which may arise on the terms

_of those instruments [the Convention and the Statute] is to be
determined, not by analogies drawn from other constitutions or
constitutional laws, but by applying the ordinary methods of
treaty interpretation’, a view which the court accepted”. (As
summarized, apparently in agreement, by McNair, Law of Treaties
(1961), p. 12.)

In the case of Railway Traffic, Lithuania and Poland, the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice held that the participation of



the two States in the adoption of a resolution of the Council of the
League of Nations constituted an “engagement” (A/B No. 42
(1931), p. 116).

The Albanian Declaration to the Council of the League of Nations
on October 2, 1921, which was registered with the League and
published in IX League of Nations Treaty Series, page 173, was
dealt with by the Permanent Court of International Justice as
a treaty in the matter of Minority Schools in Albania (A/B No. 64
(1935)). There were other similar “declarations”, e.g. that of Lithua-
nia which entered into force without any “ratification” on 11 De-
cember 1923 and was registered by the Secretariat of the League
(22 League of Nations, Treaty Series, 393). Like the Minorities
Treaties, these declarations contained clauses accepting the juris-
diction of the Permanent Court in case of “any difference of opin-
ion as to questions of law or fact arising out of these articles”.
On the conclusion that many such unilateral declarations have the
force of treaties, see 1953 Yearbook of the International Law Com-
mission, Vol. IT, pp. 98 ff.

An unusual item is No. 319 in Vol. 20 of the United Nations
Treaty Series entitled “Communiqué on the Moscow Conference of
the three Foreign Ministers signed at Moscow on 27 December 1045,
and Report of the Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America
and the United Kingdom, dated 26 December 1945, together con-
stituting an Agreement relating to the preparation of peace treaties
and to certain other problems”. [Italics supplied.] The communiqué
recites: “At the meeting of the three Foreign Ministers, discussions
took place on an informal and exploratory basis and agreement was
reached on the following questions...” The communiqué is signed
by Messrs. Byrnes, Bevin and Molotov. The agreement covered
such matters as the decision concerning the participants in signing
certain peace treaties, the establishment of the Far Eastern Commis-
sion, of the Allied Council for Japan, and of the Commission for
Korea, as well as other matters. It is interesting to compare this type
of “agreement” which was registered in the United Nations Treaty
Series, with the ‘’agreements’’ recorded in the League Council's
resolution of December 17, 1920. The question of registration will
be considered later, but it may be noted that:

“The procés-verbal'of an international conferenc. nay form an
adequate record of an informal engagement agreement. The United
Kingdom has been advised in substantially the following terms:

There is no reason based on its informality why such a record
should not constitute adequate evidence of an international
engagement. International law prescribes no form for international



engagements. There is no legal distinction between formal and
informal engagements. If an agreement is intended by the parties
to be binding, to affect their future relations, then the question
of the form it takes is irrelevant to the question of its existence.
What matters is the intention of the parties, and that intention
may be embodied in a treaty or convention or protocol or even a
declaration contained in the minutes of a conference.” [Italics
supplied] (McNair, Law of Treaties (1961), pp. 14-15.)

It is of no juridical consequence that the final agreements re-
corded in the preamble to the resolution of the League Council
of 17 December 1920, frequently referred to as “the Mandate”,
have not been located in any published separate signed instrument.
If the fact of agreement is established, the identification of a docu-
ment or instrument embodying the agreement is not required by
any rule of international law. International law contains no rule
comparable to a Statute of Frauds in some municipal legal systems.
The well-known Ihlen Declaration dealt with by the Permanent
Court in the case of Eastern Greenland became an engagement when
it was uttered; the minute in which it was subsequently recorded
was an instrument which proved the fact and the content of the
engagement but these might have been proved by other evidence.
As Judge Anzilotti said in his Dissenting Opinion (A/B No. 53, p.91):

“There does not seem to be any rule of international law requiring
that agreements of this kind must necessarily be in writing, in order
to be valid.”

Nothing in the form—or formlessness—or novelty of the Mandate,
militates against its being considered a “treaty”.

It has already been shown that the historical record and the
recital in the Council’s resolution of 17 December 1920 prove the
existence of the agreement of the Mandatory for South West Africa
with the four Principal Allied Powers. Both the Permanent Court
and this Court have considered that a Mandatory was bound by
an international agreement, embodied in an article of the Man-
dates, to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court. Specifi-
cally, the Permanent Court in Mavrommatis (Series A, No. 2,
1924) considered that the compromissory clause in the Palestine
Mandate was a treaty or convention upon which its jurisdiction
could be founded in accordance with the requirements of Article 36
of the Statute. With reference to Article 26 of the Palestine Mandate
which is the counterpart of Article 7 of the South West Africa
Mandate, the Court said:

“The parties in the present case agree that Article 26 of the
Mandate falls within the category of ‘matters specially provided for



in Treaties and Conventions in force’ under the terms of Article 36
of the Statute and the British Government does not dispute the fact
that proceedings have been duly initiated in accordance with Arti-
cle 40 of the Statute.”

It must not escape emphasis that the British Government, one
of the principal authors of the terms of the Mandates, while chal-
lenging the jurisdiction of the Court, agreed that such jurisdiction
could not be challenged on the theory that the Mandate was not a
“treaty or convention” within the meaning of Article 36 of the
Statute.

In the 1950 Advisory Opinion on the International Status of
South West Africa, there was no dissent from the view that Article 7
of the Mandate was a treaty conferring jurisdiction on this Court.
In his Separate Opinion (at p. 158), Judge Sir Arnold McNair
cited the Mavrommatis Judgment of the Permanent Court in as-
serting ‘there can be no doubt that the Mandate, which embodies
international obligations, belongs to the category of treaty or
convention...”.

After a decade had passed, Lord McNair evidently found no
reason to change his view. In the 1961 edition of his Law of Treaties,
page 639, he says: “A Mandate is essentially a treaty containing
many dispositive provisions, and it is not surprising that the Court
should have pronounced in favour of its survival.” In footnote 3,
he adds: “The author begs to refer to his Separate Opinion in
I.C.]. Reports 1950, at p. 146, stating the legal character of a
mandate and the reasons for which it seemed to him that the
mandate survived the events of 1945-1946 and continued to exist.”

The more or less contemporary understanding that a mandate
was a ‘‘treaty or convention” within the meaning of Article 36 of
the Statute is further supported by an examination of Series E,
No. 1 of the Publications of the Permanent Court of International
Justice, published in 1925. Chapter III is entitled “The Court’s
Jurisdiction”, and at page 129, one reads:

“As already stated, the Court’s jurisdiction embraces all matters
specially provided for in treaties and conventions in force. A special
publication, issued by the Court and completed and brought up to
date annually, enumerates these treaties and conventions and gives
extracts from relevant portions. The instruments in question may
be divided into several categories:

A. Peace Treaties...
B. Clauses concerning the protection of Minorities...

C. Mandates...

The Mandatory States are seven in number. The following list
gives the name of the mandatory, the mandated territory and the
date and place of the conclusion of the compact.”

The final italicized word again shows the flexibility of terminology
in this branch of law.



Does the Charter of the United Nations reveal a nice choice of
terms to describe international agreements? In interpreting the -
Charter, including the Statute of this Court, and in interpreting
the terminology of other treaties, it is important to ascertain
whether the draftsmen have been discriminating in the selection of
terms or whether varying terms have been used without conscious
intention to ascribe to the term any particular meaning or any
limitation upon its meaning. This is especially true of an instru-
ment like the Charter of the United Nations, the various Chap-
ters of which were drafted by separate commissions and commit-
tees, even though the Conference also had an elaborate co-ordinating
machinery.

Examining the Charter of the United Nations, we find in Arti-
cle 102 the expression “every treaty and every international agree-
ment”. The comparable article of the Covenant of the League of
Nations, namely Article 18, used the expression “treaty or inter-
national engagement”. The report of Committee IV/2 of the United
Nations Conference which prepared the Charter, said that the word
“agreement” in Article 102 should be interpreted to include certain
unilateral engagements of an international character. (XIII
UNCIO 705.)

Article 103 of the Charter uses merely the expression “internation-
al agreement” but there appears to be no reason to interpret this
Article as excluding any treaty, convention, accord, or other type
of international engagement or undertaking. In Article 8o (1) the
Charter refers to “international instruments to which Members ...
may ... be parties”. This clearly includes many kinds of interna-
tional agreements.

In the Statute of the Court, Article 36, paragraph I, refers to
“treaties and conventions”. But in paragraph 2 (a) of the same
Article and in Article 35 (2), only the term ‘‘treaty’ is used. It
could not possibly be argued that Article 35 (2) and Article 36,
paragraph 2 (a), intended to exclude “conventions” assuming that
one was able to distinguish between a “convention” and a “treaty”.

In Article 37 the term used again is “treaty or convention”, but
in Article 38 1 (a) the text refers merely to “international conven-
tions”. Surely it cannot be asserted that this last provision was
designed to exclude “treaties”, “agreements”, “accords”, etc. The
Report of the U.N. International Law Commission, 3 July 1962
(A/CN. 4/148, p. 15, para. 7) emphasizes the impossibility of giving
a narrow meaning to the terms in Articles 36 (2) and 38 (1) and that
no clear distinction can be made between the two. It is also true
that on the basis of the terms used, there is no ground for assigning
any particular restricted meaning to the expression ‘treaty or
convention’ in Article 36 or Article 37.



In various alternate pleadings, Respondent considers Article 7
separately and apart from the “Mandate Agreement as a whole”,
and this approach can be justified as has already been indicated
by treating this article as a “fifth agreement”. For purposes of the
jurisdictional issue now before the Court, Article 7 is the key; if
the consent to the jurisdiction of the Court which was embodied in
Article 7 has not been vitiated and if it is applicable to this Court
and to these Applicants, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the
instant cases on the merits, since, as will be shown, the third and
fourth objections to the jurisdiction are untenable.

The principle of separability is now accepted in the law of treaties,
especially with reference to multipartite treaties, although the older
classical writers tended to reject it. It is a doctrine which exists in
municipal contract law (sometimes under the label of ““divisibility”’)
and in the law governing the construction of statutes.

In treaty law the principle is evidenced in connection with the
effect of war on treaties, and by the admission of reservations to
treaties, since reservations essentially constitute the separation of
a part of a treaty from the whole in order to exempt the contracting
party from obligation under the separated part. Numerous examples
of separability in the practice of States are to be found in such
monographs as Tobin, Termination of Multipartite Treaties (1933);
Stephens, Revisions of the Treaty of Versailles (1939); Hoyt, The
Unanimity Rule in the Revision of Treaties; a Reexamination (1959).
The Permanent Court of International Justice recognized the separa-
bility principle in the Free Zones and in The Wimbledon cases.
From the standpoint of international law, part of the Mandate
Treaty may have remained in force although other parts did not.

Given the generally agreed proposition that the Mandate as an
institution survived, and the principle of separability being ad-
mitted, the question which, if any, of the provisions of the Mandate
did not survive cannot be tested by an inquiry whether this or that
provision was “essential” to the operation of the Mandate, or
whether it was merely “important” or “useful” or, indeed, “in-
consequential”; there is no objective standard which can be used
to make such an appraisal. The question which can be answered
is whether some provision or part of a provision became inoperable
and if so whether that inoperable portion was so essential to the
operation of the provision in question that the whole provision
falls. The provision which is particularly in question is the reference
in Article 7 of the Mandate to “another Member of the League
of Nations”.

In order to analyze the legal position of other “Members of the
League of Nations” in connection with the Mandates which use this



descriptive label in the compromissory article, such as Article 7 of
the Mandate for South West Africa, and in various other articles,
such as Article 5 of that same Mandate, it is not necessary, in my
opinion, to assert that the Members of the League, presumably
represented by the Council of the League, were “parties” to the
Mandate agreements. They were certainly not ‘“parties” to the
agreements between the Mandatories and the four Principal Powers,
and if the Council Resolution of 17 December 1920 is considered as
the treaty, the facts of history indicate they were not “parties”
thereto although the League of Nations itself may be considered a
“party”. The Members of the League were, however, third State
beneficiaries. The inhabitants of the territories were also beneficiaries
but the present issue before the Court does not require a considera-
tion of the nature of the rights of “any peoples” as mentioned in
Article 80 (1) of the Charter.

It is possible to agree with the Permanent Court of International
Justice that “it cannot be lightly presumed that stipulations fa-
vourable to a third State have been adopted with the object of
creating an actual right in its favour” (Free Zones, Series A/B,
No. 46, p. 147), but still to decide, as that Court did, in the case
then before it, that actual rights were created—in this case, in
favour of Members of the League by the Mandates. The Peace
settlements at the end of World War I contain various comparable
examples such as Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles relative to
the Kiel Canal, and other provisions concerning the use of water-
ways of international concern. (Cf. Lauterpacht, The Development
of International Law by the International Court (1958), sec. 96.)

Clearly the provision concerning missionaries in Article 5 of
the Mandate for South West Africa was a stipulation pour autrui
and the other Members of the League of Nations were beneficiaries
thereof. The provision reads as follows:

“Subject to the provisions of any local law for the maintenance
of public order and public morals, the Mandatory shall ensure in the
territory freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of
worship, and shall allow all missionaries, nationals of any State
Member of the League of Nations, to enter into, travel and reside
in the territory for the purpose of prosecuting their calling.”

As Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, when Rapporteur on the Law of Treaties
for the United Nations International Law Commission, said in the
course of his excellent analysis of the pacta tertiis rule:

“It is not a condition ... that the third State should be specified
eo nomine, provided it is clear from the context or surrounding
circumstances what State is intended, or that a group or class of



States is intended of which the claiming State is a member.” (1960
Yearbook of the I. L. C., Vol. II, p. 81.)

The rights of these beneficiaries could be protected by contentious
proceedings in the Permanent Court of International Justice be-
cause the compromissory clause in Article 7 was also a stipulatio,
pour autrui of which League Members were beneficiaries. The
“missionary clause” in Article 5 is the type of clause which Lord
Finlay discussed in connection with the Palestine Mandate as
being appropriate for submission to the Court. It supplies in this
case a test for the survival of certain rights, thus contributing to
a decision on the principle of such survival.

In the report of Committee IV/2 on Article 102 of the Charter,
to which reference has already been made, it is implied that a
third State which is the beneficiary of a unilateral engagement of
an international character, must “accept” the engagement in order
to make it binding. This intimation may well have been based upon
an incidental comment of the Permanent Court in its discussion of
the pacta tertiis rule in the Free Zones case. Lauterpacht’s analysis
of this judgment of the Permanent Court in which he concludes
the Court did not consider formal acceptance to be requisite, is
sound. (Ibid, pp. 306 ff.) But if general acceptance by Members of
the League in advance of specific invocation were considered
necessary, one can find it in the Assembly’s acceptance of the C
Mandates and in the continuing conduct of both the Council and
the Assembly with reference to the administration of the C Mandates.

As already quoted, Brierly, as Rapporteur for the International
Law Commission, suggested an explanation of the binding force
of unilateral declarations creative of rights against the declarant, in
a theory of “presumed consent of the beneficiary”. As also quoted
above, Corbin notes that in American contract law, the assent
of the promisee is not always required. A stipulation pour autrui
may also be considered an offer which remains outstanding until
withdrawn or terminated in some other way. Since, as will be shown
to be true in these cases, the offer contained in Article 7 was still
outstanding on 4 November 1960, the filing of the Applications on
that date was an acceptance.

Most of these explanations of unilateral engagements are based
upon some municipal system of contract law and reveal an anxiety
to fit international law into a national suit of legal clothes. For this
purpose there is at times laboured insistence upon identifying the
parties. It may be for this reason that this Court has analyzed
declarations under the Optional Clause as acts by which a “State
becomes a Party to the system of the Optional Clause” and speaks
of the “contractual relation between the Parties”. (Rights of Passage



over Indian Territory, Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports 1957,
p. 145. Italics inserted.) The Permanent Court of International
Justice, however, had pointed out that a declaration under the
Optional Clause is “a unilateral act” (Phosphates case, Series A/B,
No. 74, p. 23), and, as Lauterpacht has reminded, “Privity of
contract is not a general principle of law”. International law, not
being a formalistic system, holds States legally bound by their
undertakings in a variety of circumstances and does not need either
to insist or to deny that the beneficiaries are “parties” to the
undertakings.

The situation in regard to the rights of Members of the League
as third States beneficiaries, may be more clearly seen in its basic
elements if one considers (without any wish to consider the merits
and solely by way of illustration) one of the B Mandates, such as
that held by Belgium for Ruanda-Urundi. Under Article 7 of this
Mandate, Belgium agreed to the so-called Open Door principle
which, inter alia, forbade Belgium to discriminate in favour of her
own nationals and against the nationals of other “Members of the
League” in the granting of concessions. It is not apparent why it
would be reasonable to say that while it would have been a viola-
tion of Belgium’s contractual obligation so to discriminate against
a French citizen in the matter of a concession on 18 April 1946,
the day before the dissolution of the League, Belgium would have
been free so to discriminate on 20 April 1946. On the contrary, if
Belgium had so discriminated on 20 April, France could properly
(if diplomatic negotiations failed to result in a settlement) have
seized the Court of this dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Mandate, relying on Article 13 of the Mandate
for Ruanda-Urundi (which contains a compromissory clause iden-
tical with that in Article 7 of the Mandate for South West Africa),
and on Article 37 of the Statute to which both Belgium and France
are parties.

In the Mandate for South West Africa the Open Door Clause
was not included, but there was the provision in Article 5, already
quoted, requiring the free admission of missionaries who were
nationals of a “Member of the League”. This Article embodies the
same provisions as those in Article 8 of the Belgian Mandate. Is it
to be assumed, following the same line of reasoning as before,
that in this case, the Mandatory would have been free (so far as
the obligation in the Mandate was concerned and assuming for the
moment the non-applicability of any general rule of international
law concerning the rights of aliens) to exclude or to oust a French
missionary from South West Africa on 20 April 1946? There is no
justification for such a conclusion as a matter of common sense



and reasonable construction unless again one espouses the rejected.
view that on the dissolution of the League nothing whatever
was left of the Mandate or of the rights and obligations appertaining’
thereto, and unless one ignores the Mandatory’s undertaking given
at the final session of the League Assembly which will be discussed
shortly. ‘

But, it is argued, the right of the French missionary to enter
into or to reside in South West Africa depended, according to the
terms of Article 5 of the Mandate, upon the missionary being a
national of a “Member of the League”; after the dissolution of the
League there were no Members and hence no nationals of Members.
Accordingly, it would be said, the French missionary did lose his
right to enter or reside at the moment when the League was dis-
solved.

Such an argument assumes that the reference to “another
Member of the League” was not, as Lord McNair concluded in his
Separate Opinion in 1950 (at pp. 158-159), descriptive of a class
or category, but that it posed an imperative condition. The most
reasonable interpretation is that the specification of beneficiaries of
various provisions in all the Mandates in terms of “Members of
the League” was the natural result of the fact that the Mandates
were drawn up as part of the whole League system, a system which
it was fondly hoped in 1919 would become universal. In drawing
up agreements within the framework of this system, it was natural
to refer to other Members of the League. Article 22 of the Covenant,
in accordance with which the Mandates were established, was part of
the Treaties of Peace ending a great war with Germany and her allies.
It is reasonable to suppose that the drafters may have had in mind
a specification which would, immediately after the War, deny
privileges in the mandated areas to Germans or other ex-enemies.
This interpretation is borne out by the incident of the rejection of
the complaint in 1925 by Germany before becoming a Member of
the League. (Permanent Mandates Commission, Minutes 7th Session
(1925), p. 54.) But the quality of League Membership as compared
subsequently to the quality of a friendly former co-belligerent such
as the United States, was not, and was not intended to be, an
essential quality or a perpetually imperative condition. The loss by
the French missionary in 1946 of the quality of being a national
of a “Member of the League” did not introduce any element of
frustration which would impede the performance of the Mandatory’s
obligation to permit his entry and residence. Granted the reasons

‘which have been suggested why there should have been granted
special rights to the Members in 1919, such reasons would not be
applicable in 1946; cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex. If the
Mandatory claimed the right to limit the privileges to missionaries
who were nationals of States which were Members of the League



when the League came to an end, the claim would be reasonable
and it would avoid any charge that there was imposed on the
Mandatory an obligation more onerous than that which it had
originally assumed.

Whether the presence of missionaries in the territory in question
was “‘essential” to the discharge of the “sacred trust” can scarcely
be determined by some objective test, subjectively conceived; per-
haps an answer could be given by taking evidence, but 1 leave
that aside. ’

If it be said that only such elements of the Mandates survived
as related to the welfare, etc., of the inhabitants, then the rights
of missionaries would be included in that group of provisions. The
rights of missionaries in the South West African Mandate are set
out in Article 5, which deals in general with freedom of conscience
and worship. Surely the Mandatory should not be privileged to
interfere with the religious life of the inhabitants by expelling mis-
sionaries on April 20 1946, on the technical ground that they no
longer qualified as nationals of a Member of the League. If this
stipulation pour autrui survived the dissolution of the League des-
pite the reference to a descriptive qualification which was no longer
applicable, other such stipulations could also have survived.

What then of Article 7—and for the purpose of the present
analysis one refers only to paragraph 2 of that Article? Again one
looks in vain for some established objective test to determine
whether in 1919 and 1920 possible reference to the Court was con-
sidered “essential” to the operation of the Mandate. One knows
that the provision was inserted in all the drafts from the outset
without any opposition to the fundamental principle, though there
were some drafting problems to which attention has been called.
In Mavrommatis, Lord Finlay said (at page 43) “it was highly
necessary that a Tribunal should be provided for the settlement
of such disputes’ as he thought might well arise under the Palestine
Mandate; he might have felt differently about C Mandates, but
the Court clause was in A, B and C Mandates as in all the minorities
treaties. Was there frustration, impossibility of performance
after 19 April 1946? Did Article 7 become inoperable? In contrast
to Article 6, where the organ—namely the Council of the League—
disappeared, in Article 7 a new organ had been substituted for
the old by the operation of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court
to which of course the Mandatory was a party. That transformation
took place on the birth of the United Nations, and there can be
no doubt.that Article 7 provided for reference to this Court during
that period from the birth of the United Nations to the death of the
League.



On the dissolution of the League it is true there were no longer
States which were “Members of the League”, but did this fact
frustrate performance? It has been shown that the disappearance
of the quality of Member did not make Article 5 inoperable and
the case is even stronger here since under Article 7 the Mandatory
is not the actor, is not the operator, so to speak. In so far as concerns
the administration or operation of the Mandate, the disappearance
of the Council of the League might be said to create a measure of
frustration in regard to the required acts of the Mandatory in
filing reports. In regard to Article 7, however, the new Court was
available. In contrast to the United Nations system it will be recal-
led that the Permanent Court was not a part or organ of the League
and the winding up of the Court was separate from the dissolution of
the League. For the successful operation of the Mandate during the
life of the League, the quality of being a Member of the League
was not necessary to the operation of Article 7; as already shown
there were quite other reasons for referring to the Members.
After all, these “Members of the League” were not just concepts,
“ghosts seen in the law, elusive to the grasp”. They were actual
States or self-governing entities whose names could be recited.
The names of the original Members were listed in the Annex to
the Covenant, but it was not a fixed group; it fluctated as new
Members were admitted or as old Members terminated their mem-
berships. Yet at any given moment—as for example the moment
of the dissolution of the League—the Mandatory would always
have been able to draw up, by names, a list of the States included
in the descriptive term “Member of the League”.

It must also be remembered that the Mandatory was a ‘’Man-
datory of the League of Nations”. But according to the accepted
view, the termination of the League did not terminate the Mandate
as an institution which means that the Mandatory also, and spe-
cifically the Union of South Africa, qua Mandatory, must have
survived the dissolution of the League although its mandator
was no longer in existence.

After the dissolution of the League, how could the Mandatory
assert frustration or impossibility of performance in regard to
accepting the jurisdiction of the Court as he had agreed to do,
in accepting Article 7 originally; in accepting the transformation
effected by Article 37; and by promising in the final session of the
League Assembly that he would “continue to administer the ter-
ritory scrupulously in accordance with the obligations of the
Mandate”?

It has now been pointed out with regard to Respondent’s ac-
ceptance of the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International
Justice. that there are no technical rules of international law which



require that this acceptance be poured into some particular mould
known as ‘treaty or convention”. It has further been shown that -
these terms as used in Articles 36 and 37 of the Statute cannot
be considered generally to have any narrow, technical, restricted
meaning. It is now necessary to see whether, when the Charter
provided that in certain cases the International Court of Justice
should be substituted for the Permanent Court of International
Justice, it was intended that those provisions should be interpreted
in a strict and technical sense.

There is no basis for such an assumption. It is familiar history
that two of the central problems involved in adjusting the interna-
tional judicial machinery which had existed under the League
of Nations, to the United Nations Organization, were the questions
whether the old Court should be continued or whether there should
be a new Court, and whether the Court should be given general
compulsory jurisdiction. In the final decision to establish a new
Court, it was agreed that there should be as much continuity with
the old as possible and to emphasize the close relationship, the
Charter recites in Article 92 that the new Statute “is based upon”
the old Statute. “In a sense”, says the Report of Committee IV/1
of the San Francisco Conference, “… the new Court may be looked
upon as the successor to the old Court which is replaced. The
succession will be explicitly contemplated in some of the provisions
of the new Statute, notably in Article 36, paragraph 4 [later num-
bered 5], and Article 37.” (13 UNCIO 384.)

It was clearly the intention in the drafting of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice to preserve for the new Court just
as much as possible of the jurisdiction which appertained to the
old Court. For this purpose, Article 36 (5) provided for the transfer
of the obligations assumed by States which made declarations
under Article 36 of the old Statute, and Article 37 provided for a
similar transfer where a “treaty or convention” had contained a pro-
vision for the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court. As is said in
the Joint Dissenting Opinion in Aerial Incident (1959), page 166
and page 171: “It was for the purpose of preserving for the new
Court the compulsory jurisdiction which had been conferred upon
the old Court and whose period of validity had not expired that
paragraph 5 was adopted and inserted in Article 36 of the present
Statute and that Article 37 was introduced... Article 37 provides
the consensual link with regard to the succession of the Interna-
tional Court of Justice to the jurisdiction of ... the Permanent
Court...” It would not be in accordance with the spirit and intent
of Articles 36 (5) and 37 to interpret them in such a way as to
leave a gap through which would fall to the ground such an agree-
ment as is recorded in Article 7 of the Mandate.
