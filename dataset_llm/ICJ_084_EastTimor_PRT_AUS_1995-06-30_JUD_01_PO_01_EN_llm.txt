1. I voted in favour of the Judgment because I agreed with the Court
that the Application brought by Portugal against Australia on 22 Febru-
ary 1991 should be dismissed, as the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain
it.

However, I am unable to subscribe to the reason given by the Court
for this finding, that is, that

“[the Court] cannot, in this case, exercise the jurisdiction it has by
virtue of the declarations made by the Parties under Article 36, para-
graph 2, of its Statute because, in order to decide the claims of Por-
tugal, it would have to rule, as a prerequisite, on the lawfulness of
Indonesia’s conduct in the absence of that State’s consent” (Judg-
ment, para. 35; emphasis added.)

When it refers to the “consent” of Indonesia the Court itself seems to be
uncertain as to what this “consent” of Indonesia would have meant.
Would it have meant that, in order for the Court to exercise its jurisdic-
tion, Indonesia would have had to have intervened in these proceedings
or would it have meant that Indonesia would have had to have accepted
that jurisdiction under Article 36 (2) of the Statute?

For my part, I believe that the Court cannot adjudicate upon the
Application of Portugal for the sole reason that Portugal lacked locus
standi to bring against Australia this particular case concerning the con-
tinental shelf in the Timor Sea.

2. Portugal, in its Application, defined the dispute, on the one hand, as

“relate[d] to the opposability to Australia:

(a) of the duties of, and delegation of authority to, Portugal as the
administering Power of the Territory of East Timor; and

(b) of the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination,
and the related rights (right to territorial integrity and unity
and permanent sovereignty over natural wealth and resources)”
(Application, para. 1).

On the other hand, Australia, which did not regard Portugal as having
authority over the Territory of East Timor in the late 1980s, has only
been accused by Portugal in its Application of having engaged in



“[the] activities . . . [which] have taken the form of the negotiation and
conclusion by Australia with a third State [Indonesia] of an agreement
relating to the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in
the area of the ‘Timor Gap’ and the negotiation, currently in progress,
of the delimitation of that same shelf with that same third State [Indo-
nesia]” (Application, para. 2; emphasis added).

3. If there had been anything for Portugal to complain about this
would not have been “the opposability” to any State of either “the duties
of, and delegation of authority to, Portugal as the administering Power
of the Territory of East Timor”, or “the right of the people of East Timor
to self-determination, and the related rights” (Application, para. 1). Any
complaint could only have related to Portugal’s alleged title, whether as
an administering Power or otherwise, to the Territory of East Timor
together with the corresponding title to the area of continental shelf
which would overlap with that of Australia. In this respect Portugal, in
its Application, has given an incorrect definition of the dispute and seems
to have overlooked the difference between the opposability to any State
of its rights and duties as the administering Power or of the rights of the
people of East Timor and the more basic question of whether Portugal is
the State entitled to assert these rights and duties.

4. What, then, did Australia actually do to Portugal or the people of
East Timor? It is essential to note that, in the area of the “Timor Gap”,
Australia has not asserted a new claim to any seabed area intruding into
the area of any State or of the people of the Territory of East Timor, nor
has it acquired any new seabed area from any State or from that people
(see sketch-map on page 109).

In fact, Australia’s original title to the continental shelf in the “Timor
Gap” cannot be challenged at all by any State or by any people. Under
the contemporary rules of international law, Australia is entitled ipso jure
to its own continental shelf in the southern part of the Timor Sea — but
at the same time a State which has territorial sovereignty over East
Timor, and which lies opposite to Australia at a distance of roughly 250
nautical miles, has the title with respect to the continental shelf off its
coast in the northern part of the “Timor Gap” (see sketch-map: vertical
hatching). How far each continental shelf extends is determined not in
geographical terms but by the legal concept of the continental shelf.

5. A recital of the events which have taken place since the 1970s in
relation to the delimitation of the continental shelf in the relevant areas
can usefully be given at this stage.

Pursuant to the Agreement “establishing certain seabed boundaries”
(United Nations, Treaty Series, Vol. 974, p. 307), Australia and Indo-
nesia drew a line of delimitation east of longitude 133° 23’ E in the Arafura
Sea on 18 May 1971 — in the area between Australia, on the one hand,
and West Irian (Indonesian territory on the island of New Guinea) and
Aru Island (Indonesian territory), on the other. On 9 October 1972 the
same two Governments, acting under the Agreement “establishing cer-
tain seabed boundaries in the area of the Timor and Arafura seas, sup-
plementary to the Agreement of 18 May 1971” (United Nations, Treaty
Series, Vol. 974, p. 319) (N.B. the Chart attached to this Agreement is
reproduced on page 111 of this opinion), defined other lines of delimita-
tion west of longitude 133° 23” E extending to longitude 127° 56’ E in the
area of the Timor and Arafura seas between Australia, on the one hand,
and the Tanimbar Islands (Indonesian territory), on the other. Another
line was drawn westward from longitude 126° 00” E. This latter agree-
ment, however, left open a gap of nearly 120 nautical miles between these
two lines off the coast of “Portuguese Timor” (as it is called on a chart
attached to the Agreement), which was commonly known as the “Timor
Gap”.

left open for Portugal’s benefit by the 1972 Agreement between Indonesia
and Australia. This certainly leads one to question whether Portugal did,
at that time, deem itself to be in the position of a coastal State with sov-

ereignty over the eastern part of the island of Timor (East Timor) and
whether it in fact thought that it could claim a title to the continental
shelf in the “Timor Gap”.

Instead of dividing the area by drawing a boundary, as in the case of
the 1971 and 1972 Agreements with Indonesia as explained above, Aus-
tralia agreed in the 1989 Treaty with Indonesia “on the Zone of Coopera-
tion in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and
northern Australia” to constitute a “Zone of Cooperation”. The content
of the 1989 Treaty — what was gained and lost in the “Timor Gap” both
by Australia and by the State lying opposite to it (see sketch-map: State
X as indicated therein) — cannot be disputed, as the Treaty was drawn
up with the consent of the States concerned.

6. Indonesia had apparently claimed since the 1970s the status of a

7. If Portugal was the coastal State with a claim to the continental
shelf in the “Timor Gap” (see sketch-map: vertical hatching), then the
Treaty which Australia concluded with Indonesia in 1989 would certainly



have been null and void from the outset. Alternatively, if Indonesia was
the coastal State, and thus had a right over the relevant area of the con-
tinental shelf (see sketch-map: vertical hatching), then Portugal quite
simply had no right to bring this case. In order to do so, Portugal would
have had to have been a coastal State lying opposite to Australia.

In order to entertain the Application against Australia with respect to
the continental shelf in the “Timor Gap” or, more specifically, the area
called the “Zone of Cooperation” which Australia claims in part, the
Court needs to be convinced, as a preliminary issue, of the standing of
Portugal in this case as being a coastal State with a claim to the conti-
nental shelf in the Timor Sea as of 1991, the year of the Application (see
sketch-map: State X as indicated therein).

As 1 repeat, an issue on which Portugal could have initiated a dispute
would have been its own entitlement to the continental shelf off the coast
of East Timor, but could not have related to the competence of Australia
to conclude a treaty with Indonesia.

8. The present Judgment, in my view, seems to rely heavily on the
jurisprudence of the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed from
Rome in 1943 (1954). That case does not seem to be relevant to the
present case as the Court found in 1954 that “[t]o go into the merits of
[questions which relate to the lawful or unlawful character of certain
actions of Albania vis-à-vis Italy]” in a case brought by Italy against
France, among other co-Respondents, “would be to decide a dispute
between Italy and Albania” and that “[t]he Court cannot decide such a
dispute without the consent of Albania” (7.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32). In
that case “Albania’s legal interests would not only be affected by a deci-
sion [of the Court], but would form the very subject-matter of the deci-
sion” (ibid.).

The present case is quite different in nature. The dispute does not
relate to whether Indonesia, the third State, was entitled in principle to
conclude a treaty with Australia, but rather the subject-matter of the
whole case relates solely to the question of whether Portugal or Indo-
nesia, as a State lying opposite to Australia, was entitled to the continen-
tal shelf in the “Timor Gap”. This could have been the subject of a
dispute between Portugal and Indonesia, but cannot be a matter in which
Portugal and Australia can be seen to be in dispute with Indonesia as a
State with “an interest of a legal nature which may be affected”.

19. Irrespective of the status of East Timor — which is still in abey-
ance according to the United Nations — and irrespective of the rights of
the people of East Timor to self-determination guaranteed by the United
Nations Charter, it is clear that Portugal has not been considered — at
least since the early 1980s — to be a coastal State lying opposite to
Australia and that in 1991, when Portugal’s Application was filed in the
Registry of the Court, it did not have any authority over the region of
East Timor, from the coast of which the continental shelf extends south-
wards in the Timor Sea.

20. It follows that Portugal lacks standing as an Applicant State in this
proceeding which relates to the continental shelf extending southward
into the Timor Sea from the coast of East Timor in the “Timor Gap”.
For this reason alone, the Court does not, in my view, have jurisdiction
to entertain the Application of Portugal and the Application must be dis-
missed.
