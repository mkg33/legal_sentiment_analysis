|. My vote in favour of subparagraphs (2), (3), (10) and (11) of para-
graph 153 does not mean that I share each and every part of the reason-
ing followed by the Court in reaching its conclusions. Time constraints to
present this separate opinion within the period fixed by the Court de not
permit me to make a complete explanation of my disagreement with the
remaining subparagraphs of paragraph 153. However I wish to advance
some of my main reasons for voting against them.

3. In my opinion, the contention of the United Mexican States (here-
inafter “Mexico”) should have been upheld, because the Parties agreed to
a single round of pleadings and nothing was said about preliminary
objections. The United States of America (hereinafter “the United States™)
thus gave its consent not to raise preliminary objections, and conse-
quently its objections were not to be examined as such, This reason
explains my vote against paragraph 153, subparagraph (1), where the
Court rejects Mexico's contention that it should disregard the prelimi-
nary objections raised by the United States against Mexico's claims based
on violations by the United States of Article 36 of the 24 April 1963
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (hereinafter “the Vienna
Convention”).

8. It was for Mexico to discharge this burden of proof because, as
Judge John E. Read recalled, “municipal laws are merely facts which
express the will and constitute the activities of States” indicating that this
rule had been established by the Permanent Court of International
Justice in a long series of decisions and the following in particular:

“Polish Upper Silesia — Series À, No. 7, page 19.
Serbian Loans — Series A, Nos. 20/21, page 46.
Brazilian Loans — Series À, Nos. 20/21, page 124.
Lighthouses Case (France/Greece) — Series A/B, No. 62, page 22.




Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway Case — Series A/B, No. 76,
page 19.” (Nottebohm, Second Phase, Judgment, 1 C.J. Reports
1955, p. 36, dissenting opinion of Judge Read.)

9. Moreover it is a generally accepted principle. Oppenheim’s Interna-
tional Law explains:

“From the standpoint of international law, a national law is gen-
erally regarded as a fact with reference to which rules of interna-
tional law have to be applied, rather than as a rule to be applied on
the international plane as a rule of law; and insofar as the Interna-
tional Court of Justice is called upon to express an opinion as to the
effect of a rule of national law it will do so by treating the matter as
a question of fact to be established as such rather than as a question
of law to be decided by the court.” (Oppenheim’s International Law,
Oth ed., edited by Sir Robert Jennings, Q.C., and Sir Arthur Watts,
K.C.M.G., Q.C., Vol. 1, “Peace”, Introduction and Part 1, 1996,
p. 83, para. 21.)

10. This notwithstanding, paragraph 57 of the Judgment states:

“The Court finds that it is for Mexico to show that the 52 persons
listed in paragraph 16 above held Mexican nationality at the time of
their arrest. The Court notes that to this end Mexico has produced
birth certificates and declarations of nationality, whose contents
have not been challenged by the United States.”

11. M is difficult for me to agree with this conclusion because Mexico
has not discharged its burden of proof. The declarations from 42 of all
the persons concerned are ex parte documents, which cannot, by them-
selves, demonstrate Mexican nationality; and the birth certificates pre-
sented by Mexico for each of the 52 individuals undoubtedly demonstrate
that they were born in Mexico, but do not prove their Mexican nation-
ality because Mexico did not provide the text of Article 30 of the Mexi-
can Constitution. In view of this omission it cannot be established, from
the evidence presented by Mexico, that the 52 persons identified in its
Memorial automatically acquired Mexican nationality at the time of their
birth by virtue of the jus soli. For this reason, unless I were to rely on
extralegal considerations, as the Judgment itself does, | had no alterna-
tive but to conclude that the claims presented by Mexico against the
United States cannot be upheld since the Mexican nationality of the 52
persons concerned was not demonstrated and this is, in the present case,
a necessary condition for the application of Article 36 of the Vienna Con-
vention and for Mexico's exercise of its right to diplomatic protection of
its nationals. Therefore, in my opinion, subparagraphs (4), (3), (6), (7),
(8) and (9) of paragraph 153 were to be rejected.

16. Paragraph 40 of the Judgment examines the application of the rule
of exhaustion of local remedies when dealing with the second preliminary
objection to admissibility presented by the United States.

17. It indicates:

“The Court would first observe that the individual rights of Mexi-
can nationals under subparagraph 1 (4) of Article 36 of the Vienna
Convention are rights which are to be asserted, at any rate in the
first place, within the domestic legal system of the United States.
Only when that process is completed and local remedies are exhausted
would Mexico be entitled to espouse the individual claims of its
nationals through the procedure of diplomatic protection.”

18. Paragraph 40 adds:

“In the present case Mexico does not, however, claim to be acting
solely on that basis. It also asserts its own claims, basing them on the
injury which it contends that it has itself suffered directly and
through its nationals, as a result of the violation by the United States
of the obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, para-
graph 1 (a), (b) and 7¢}.”

19. Then paragraph 40 recalls the LaGrand Judgment, where it was
recognized that Article 36, paragraph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention
creates individual rights of the foreign national concerned which may be
invoked in this Court by the national State of the detained person (7 C.J.
Reports 2001, p. 494, para. 77). Paragraph 40 further observes

“that violations of the rights of the individual under Article 36 may
entail a violation of the rights of the sending State, and that viola-
tions of the rights of the latter may entail à violation of the rights of
the individual. In these special circumstances of interdependence of
the rights of the State and of individual rights, Mexico may, in sub-
mitting a claim in its own name, request the Court to rule on the
violation of rights which it claims to have suffered both directly and
through the violation of individual rights conferred on Mexican
nationals under Article 36, paragraph 1 (b).”



20. Paragraph 40 of the Judgment concludes:

“The duty to exhaust local remedies does not apply to such a
request. Further, for reasons just explained, the Court does not find
it necessary to deal with Mexico's claims of violation under a distinct
heading of diplomatic protection. Without needing to pronounce at
this juncture on the issues raised by the procedural default rule, as
explained by Mexico in paragraph 39 above, the Court accordingly
finds that the second objection by the United States to admissibility
cannot be upheld.”

21. In my opinion, this conclusion is misleading. Paragraph 40 should
have stated that the local remedies requirement does not apply when the
injury is claimed to have been done directly to the rights of Mexico and
not that it is not applicable to the claim made by Mexico in its own name.
Now, the claims presented by Mexico in the exercise of diplomatic pro-
tection of its nationals are claims of Mexico in its own right, as was
acknowledged in the well-known dictum of the 30 August 1924 Judgment
of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Mavrommatis
Palestine Concessions case, where it was specified that

“By taking up the case of one of its subjects and by resorting to
diplomatic action or international judicial proceedings on his behalf,
a State is in reality asserting its own rights — its right to ensure, in
the person of its subjects, respect for the rules of international law.”

(Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 2, p. 12.)

22. This principle is generally accepted and has recently been repro-
duced in Article |, paragraph 1, of the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Pro-
tection prepared by the International Law Commission, indicating that:

“Diplomatic protection consists of resort to diplomatic action or
other means of peaceful settlement by a State adopting in its own
right the cause of its national in respect of an injury to that national
arising from an internationally wrongful act of another State.”

23. Therefore, in the present case, the relevant element in deciding
whether local remedies had to be exhausted is whether Mexico was
directly injured by the actions of the United States. As the International
Law Commission explains

“The exhaustion of local remedies rule applies only to cases in
which the claimant State has been injured ‘indirectly’, that is,
through its national. It does not apply where the claimant State is
directly injured by the wrongful act of another State, as here the



State has a distinct reason of its own for bringing an international
claim.”

24. Consequently Article 9 of its Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protec-
tion provides that

“[ocal! remedies shall be exhausted where an international claim, or
request for a declaratory judgment related to the claim, is brought
preponderantly on the basis of an injury to a national or other per-
son referred to in article 7 [8]”.

25, However the International Law Commission also observes that

“In practice it is difficult to decide whether the claim is ‘direct’ or
‘indirect’ where it is ‘mixed’, in the sense that it contains elements of
both injury to the State and injury to the nationals of the State . . .
In the case of a mixed claim it is incumbent upon the tribunal to
examine the different elements of the claim and to decide whether
the direct or the indirect element is preponderant . . . Closely related
to the preponderance test is the sine qua non or ‘but for” test, which
asks whether the claim comprising elements of both direct and
indirect injury would have been brought were it not for the claim
on behalf of the injured national. If this question is answered nega-
tively, the claim is an indirect one and local remedies must be
exhausted. There is, however, little to distinguish the preponderance
test from the ‘but for’ test. If a claim is preponderantly based on
injury to a national this is evidence of the fact that the claim would
not have been brought but for the injury to the national. In these
circumstances the Commission preferred to adopt one test only —
that of preponderance.” (United Nations, Report of the Interna-
tional Law Commission, Fifty-fifth Session (5 May-6 June and 7 July-
8 August 2003), Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-
eighth Session, Supplement No. 10 (AS58/10), pp. 89-90).

26. In the present case Mexico has advanced, in its own right, a claim
against the United States. However, the application of the exhaustion of
local remedies rule depends not on whether Mexico presents the claim in
its own right, but on whether Mexico was directly injured by the alleged
actions of the United States.

27. Mexico maintains that there was a breach by the United States of
the Vienna Convention, an unlawful act in the relations between the
two States, on each occasion the United States authorities did not inform
the Mexican nationals arrested of their rights under Article 36, para-
graph 1 (5). Consequently, Mexico’s claim is a “mixed” claim, to use
the terminology of the International Law Commission, as recognized
in paragraph 40 of the Judgment where it is stated that there are
“special circumstances of interdependence of the rights of the State and


| AVENA AND OTHERS (SEP. OP. PARRA-ARANGUREN)

of individual rights”. Therefore, it was for the Court to determine
whether Mexico's claim was preponderantly based on injury to a national
and would not have been brought but for the injury to its national.

28. In my opinion, Mexico would not have presented its claim against
the United States but for the injury suffered by its nationals. Conse-
quently the local remedies rule applies to the claims “in its own right”
submitted by Mexico in its first final submission and therefore the Court
should have examined each of the individual cases to determine whether
the local remedies had been exhausted, which do not include “approach
to the executive for relief in the exercise of its discretionary powers . . .
remedies as of grace or those whose ‘purpose is to obtain a favour and
not to vindicate a right’ ”. If that was not case, the claims presented by
Mexico in the exercise of diplomatic protection of its nationals were to be
dismissed, unless covered by any of the customarily accepted exceptions
to the local remedies rule, taking into consideration Article 10 of the
, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection prepared by the International

Law Commission (United Nations, Report of the International Law
Commission, Fifty-fifth Session (5 May-6 June and 7 July-8 August 2003),
Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-eighth Session, Supple-
ment No. 10 (A/58/10), pp. 88, 92-102). Therefore, it is not possible for
me to agree with the conclusion reached in paragraph 40 of the Judgment.

29. On 14 February 2002, the Court stated:

“The Court would recall the well-established principle that ‘it is
the duty of the Court not only to reply to the questions as stated in
the final submissions of the parties, but also to abstain from deciding
points not included in those submissions’ (Asylum, Judgment, LC.J
Reports 1950, p. 402). While the Court is thus not entitled to decide
upon questions not asked of it, the non ultra petita rule nonetheless
cannot preclude the Court from addressing certain legal points in its
reasoning.” (Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic
of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 2002, pp. 18-19,
para. 43.)

30. In my opinton this statement supports the following observations
on the Judgment in the present case.

31. In its first final submission Mexico requests the Court to adjudge
and declare:




“That the United States of America, in arresting, detaining, try-
ing, convicting, and sentencing the 52 Mexican nationals on death
row described in Mexico’s Memorial, violated its international legal
obligations to Mexico, in its own right and in the exercise of its
right to diplomatic protection of its nationals, by failing to inform,
without delay, the 52 Mexican nationals after their arrest of their
right to consular notification and access under Article 36 (1) (b)
of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and by depriving
Mexico of its right to provide consular protection and the 52 natio-
nals’ right to receive such protection as Mexico would provide under
Article 36 (1) (a) and (c) of the Convention.” (Judgment,
para. 14 {1})

32. Subparagraphs (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of paragraph 153, in a
rather sophisticated way, adjudge and declare that “the United States
breached the obligations incumbent upon it” under Article 36, para-
graph 1 /b) (subparas. (4) and (5)); that “the United States breached the
obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, paragraph 1 (a) and (c/
of the Convention” (subpara. (6)); that “the United States . . . breached
the obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, paragraph 1 (ce) of
the Convention” (subpara. (7)); and that “the United States breached the
obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Con-
vention” (subpara. (8)). However, that is not an answer to the first final
submission presented by Mexico, where Mexico asks the Court to adjudge
and declare that the United States violated “its international legal obli-
gations to Mexico, in its own right and in the exercise of its right to
diplomatic protection”. Therefore, in my opinion, the operative part
of the Judgment should have responded to the request made by Mexico
in its first final submission.
