1. I regret that I am unable to agree with any of the three points in the
operative part of the Judgment as I see the whole case from a different
viewpoint to that of the Court.

2. The crux of the case before us is simple in that, to use the expression
used by Libya in its Application, the United Kingdom “continues to
adopt a posture of pressuring Libya into surrendering the accused” and
“is rather intent on compelling the surrender of the accused”.

The United Kingdom and Libya have adopted different positions con-
cerning the surrender (transfer) of the two Libyans who are accused of
the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie and who are located
in Libya. Those differing positions of the applicant State and the respon-
dent State did not, however, constitute a “dispute . . . concerning the
interpretation or application of the [1971 Montreal] Convention” to
which both are parties (Montreal Convention, Art. 14, para. 1).

In order to clarify this conclusion, I find it necessary to examine the
chain of events which have occurred since the United Kingdom outlined,
on 13 November 1991, its position on the Lockerbie incident and which
led to Libya filing its Application on 3 March 1992.

A. The United Kingdom and Libya's Respective Claims

3. The destruction of Pan Am flight 103 occurred on 21 December
1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in the territory of the United Kingdom
and involved the death of 11 residents of Lockerbie, 259 passengers and
crew, including 189 United States nationals and at least 29 United King-
dom nationals, and a number of citizens of another 19 States.



The United Kingdom's demand that Libya surrender the suspects


cedure on its own territory where the suspects were to be found and made
clear that it had no intention of surrendering them to the United King-
dom, although it later expressed its readiness to hand the two suspects
over to a third, neutral, State or to an international tribunal. Libya
accused the United Kingdom of attempting to cause difficulties in
demanding the surrender of the suspects.

12. In fact, what occurred between the United Kingdom and Libya
was simply a demand by the United Kingdom for the surrender to it of
the suspects located in Libya and a refusal by Libya to comply with that
demand.

In demanding the surrender of the two suspects, the United Kingdom
made an attempt to justify that demand as an appeal that criminal justice
be pursued. The United Kingdom did not claim that Libya would be
legally bound under any particular law to surrender the two suspects. In
none of the documents that it issued did the United Kingdom make any
mention of the Montreal Convention nor did it accept that that Conven-
tion applied to the incident, including the matter of the surrender of the
suspects. Nor did Libya, until January 1992, invoke the Montreal Con-
vention as the basis of its refusal to surrender the two suspects to the
United Kingdom.

Libya invokes the Montreal Convention only on 18 January 1992

13. On 18 January 1992, the Secretary of the Libyan People’s Com-
mittee addressed a letter to the United States Secretary of State and the
Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom through the Embassies of Bel-
gium and Italy which were entrusted with looking after the interests of
those two countries in Libya. After pointing out that the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Libya were States parties to the 1971 Montreal
Convention, Libya’s letter stated:

“out of respect for the principle of the ascendancy of the rule of law
and in implementation of the Libyan Code of Criminal Procedure
. . . as soon as the charges were made, Libya immediately exercised
its jurisdiction over the two alleged offenders in accordance with its
obligation under article 5, paragraph 2, of the Montreal Convention
by adopting certain measures to ascertain their presence and taking
immediate steps to institute a preliminary inquiry. It notified the
States . . . that the suspects were in custody . . .

As a State party to the Convention and in accordance with para-
graph 2 of [article 5], we took such measures as might be necessary
to establish our jurisdiction over any of the offences . . . because the
alleged offender in the case was present in our territory.

Moreover, article 7 of the Convention stipulates that the Con-
tracting Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is found
shall, if it does not extradite him, submit the case to its competent


87 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (DISS. OP. ODA)

authorities for the purpose of prosecution and that those authorities
shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any
ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State.”
(See United Nations doc. S/23441, Ann.)

14. It was in Libya’s letter of 18 January 1992, as quoted above, that
the 1971 Montreal Convention was first mentioned. The United King-
dom did not respond to that letter. The United Kingdom was then
informed by the Registrar of the Court on 3 March 1992 of Libya’s
Application in which reference was again made to the Montreal Conven-
tion. It is important that this point should not be overlooked in deciding
whether there did or did not exist, on the date of the Application (namely
3 March 1992), “any dispute . . . concerning the interpretation or applica-
tion of the [Montreal] Convention which cannot be settled through nego-
tiation” (Montreal Convention, Art. 14, para. 1).

B. The Relevant Issues of International Law

15. There is no doubt that the 1971 Montreal Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation is, in
general, applicable to the destruction of the American Pan Am aircraft
which occurred in December 1988 over Lockerbie in the United King-
dom, as long as both Libya and the United Kingdom are parties to it.

Neither Party seems ever to have doubted that that destruction consti-
tuted a “crime” under the 1971 Convention. That point, however, is not
in issue between the two States; nor is the prevention of international
terrorism at issue in this case since proceedings were brought by Libya
and not by the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, the question of whether the United Kingdom can hold
Libya, as a State, responsible for the acts of Libyan nationals relating to
the destruction of the American Pan Am aircraft over United Kingdom
territory and of whether the explosion was caused by alleged Libyan

Criminal jurisdiction

17. No State is prevented from exercising its criminal jurisdiction over
a person or persons who have committed a crime on its territory, or a
person or persons who have committed serious damage to its interest or
against its nationals, or who have committed a crime of universal juris-
diction anywhere in the world. Accordingly, there is no doubt that in this
case the United Kingdom is competent to exercise its criminal jurisdic-
tion over the two suspects, whoever they may be and wherever they may
be located.

Conversely, nor is there any doubt that any State is entitled to exercise
its criminal jurisdiction over a serious crime committed by its nationals
anywhere, either on its own territory or abroad. Libya’s rights in this
respect do not seem to have been challenged by the United Kingdom.

18. Thus, the right to prosecute or punish criminals does not fall
within the exclusive jurisdiction of any particular State, either the State in
which the crime has been committed (in this instance, the United King-
dom) or the State of which the criminal is a national (in this instance,
Libya). The Libyan suspects in this case are subject to the concurrent
jurisdictions of either the State where they have committed the crime
or of the State where they are located. The Montreal Convention adds
nothing to this general principle and does not deviate at all from it.

There is no difference in the views of the Applicant and the Respon-
dent regarding the interpretation of those general rules of international
law. There exists, apparently, no dispute in this respect.

20. States have not been under an obligation to extradite accused per-
sons under general international law but some specific treaties, either


89 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (DISS. OP. ODA)

multilateral or bilateral, have imposed the obligation on contracting
States to extradite accused persons to other contracting States. The
Montreal Convention is certainly one of those treaties.

An exception to that obligation to extradite criminals is made, how-
ever, in the event that the accused are of the nationality of the State
which is requested to extradite them. This rule of non-extradition of
nationals of the requested State may not seem to be quite appropriate for
the purposes of criminal justice, as the accused may more adequately be
prosecuted in the country where the actual crime occurred. While no rule
of international law prohibits extradition of nationals of the requested
State, there is a long-standing international practice which recognizes
that there is no obligation to extradite one’s own nationals. The
Montreal Convention is no exception as it does not provide for the extra-
dition of nationals of the requested State even for the punishment of these
universally recognized unlawful acts.


22. Thus conceived, the question relating to the United Kingdom’s
demand that Libya surrender the two suspects and Libya’s refusal to
accede to that demand is not a matter of rights or legal obligation con-
cerning the extradition of accused persons between the United Kingdom
and Libya under international law nor is it a matter falling within the
provisions of the Montreal Convention. Or, at least, there is no. legal dis-
pute between Libya and the United Kingdom concerning the interpreta-
tion or application of the Montreal Convention which could have been
brought to arbitration or to the Court.

If there is any difference between them on this matter, that could
simply be a difference between their respective policies towards criminal
justice in connection with the question of which State should. properly

. do justice on the matter. That issue does not fall within the ambit of
the Montreal Convention.

‘23. Itherefore conclude that no grounds exist on which the Court may
exercise its: jurisdiction to hear the present Application instituted by
Libya.

IT. THE QUESTION OF ADMISSIBILITY — THE EFFECT
OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS

24. As I have stated above, I am firmly of the view that the Court
lacks the jurisdiction to consider this Application filed by Libya. If the
Court’s. jurisdiction is denied, as I believe it should be, the issue of
whether the Application is or is not admissible does not arise. For me, at
least, it is meaningless to discuss the question of admissibility. However,
the Court, after finding that it

“has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article 14, paragraph 1, of the

Montreal Convention . . . to hear the disputes between Libya

and the United Kingdom as to the interpretation or application

of the provisions of that Convention” (Judgment, operative para-

graph 53 (1) (b)),
continues to deal with the question of admissibility and finds that “the
Application filed by Libya . . . is admissible” (para. 53 (2) (b)) by “reject-
[ing] the objection to admissibility derived by the United Kingdom from
Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993)” (para. 53 (2) (a)).
Despite the fact that I am of the view that the question of admissibility
should not arise since the Court should dismiss the Application on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction, I would now like to comment upon the
impact of these Security Council resolutions, which is the only issue dealt
with in the present Judgment in connection with whether the Application
is admissible or not.

25. Before doing so, I also have to refer to another point in the Judg-

ment on which I disagree. The Judgment states that the Court

“Declares that the objection raised by the United Kingdom
according to which Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and
883 (1993) have rendered the claims of Libya without object does
not, in the circumstances of the case, have an exclusively prelimi-
nary character.” (Operative paragraph 53 (3).)

Kingdom and the United States announced the indictment of the two
Libyan suspects, the Secretary of the Libyan People’s Committee sent
letters addressed directly to the United Nations Secretary-General (as
indicated in paragraph 30 below) in an effort to draw the attention of the
United Nations member States to the chain of events that had unfolded

matter quite irrelevant to this case and the question of whether Libya’s
Application is without object in the light of those resolutions hardly
arises.

*

43. Even though I found that Libya’s Application should be dismissed
owing to the Court’s lack of jurisdiction, I nonetheless wanted to express
my view that these Security Council resolutions, which have a political
connotation in dealing with broader aspects of threats to the peace or
breaches of the peace, have nothing to do with the present case, which,
had there been jurisdiction, could have been submitted to the Court as a
legal issue which existed between the United Kingdom and Libya, and
between the United States and Libya, before the resolutions were adopted
by the Security Council.
