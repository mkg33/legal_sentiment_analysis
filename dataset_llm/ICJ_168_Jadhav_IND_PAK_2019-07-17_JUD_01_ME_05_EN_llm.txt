   1. Much to my regret and with greatest respect, I could not endorse
several parts of the Judgment and some fundamental points. First, I con-
sider that the Court should have found India’s Application to be inadmis-
sible in light of its conduct in the present case, which amounts to an abuse
of rights. In my view, India’s reliance on the Vienna Convention on Con-
sular Relations (hereinafter “Vienna Convention” or “VCCR”) in the
present case is misplaced and subverts the very object and purpose of that
instrument. Second, the Court has misconstrued and rendered meaning-
less Article 73, paragraph 2, of the Vienna Convention, which does not
preclude States parties from entering into subsequent bilateral agree-
ments. Notwithstanding that, the Court has ignored the legal eﬀect of the
2008 Agreement on Consular Access between India and Pakistan (herein-
after “2008 Agreement”) and speciﬁcally its point (vi). In my view, by
concluding the 2008 Agreement, the Parties (India and Pakistan) aimed
to clarify the application of certain provisions of the Vienna Convention
to the extent of their bilateral relations, namely by recognizing that each
contracting State may consider on the merits whether to allow access and
consular assistance to nationals of the other contracting State arrested or
detained on “political or security grounds”. Third, even if the Vienna
Convention is applicable to the case of Mr. Jadhav, Pakistan’s conduct
does not constitute a breach of its obligations under paragraph 1 of Arti-
cle 36 thereof. Fourth, while the Court has taken note of the existing legal
framework in Pakistan, it has failed to recognize that the existing judicial
review in Pakistan already substantially responds to the relief ordered by
the Court. Finally, the Court’s Judgment appears to set a dangerous pre-
cedent at the times when States are increasingly confronted with transna-
tional terrorist activities and impending threats to national security.

  I. India’s Application Should Have Been Declared Inadmissible
                as It Amounts to an Abuse of Rights

  2. The present case is distinguishable from the Court’s Avena and
LaGrand jurisprudence on which the Court has heavily relied. Among
various distinguishing factors, the most important one is that the Court
was faced here with special circumstances of an individual arrested,
detained, tried and convicted for espionage and terrorism oﬀences. The
Vienna Convention, having been concluded with the view to contributing
“to the development of friendly relations among nations”, it can hardly
be the case that the drafters of that Convention intended for its rights and
obligations to apply to spies and nationals of the sending State (India) on
secret missions to threaten and undermine the national security of the
receiving State (Pakistan).

   3. In these proceedings, Pakistan rightly submitted that India commit-
ted an abuse of rights: (a) by providing Mr. Jadhav with an authentic
passport under a false Muslim identity, Hussein Mubarak Patel;
(b) by seeking to exercise its consular rights in order to have access to
Mr. Jadhav, an espionage agent ; and (c) by invoking the Court’s provi-
sional measures jurisdiction with an exaggerated characterization of the
urgency of the situation and a lack of candour regarding the facts (Counter-
Memorial of Pakistan (hereinafter “CMP”), para. 151 ﬀ. ; CR 2019/2,
p. 25, para. 40 (Qureshi)). Pakistan further argued that India acted in bad
faith by refusing to accede to Pakistan’s requests for information con-
cerning the authenticity of Mr. Jadhav’s passport and to otherwise assist
Pakistan in the criminal investigation, while making persistent demands
of consular access to Mr. Jadhav (CMP, paras. 171-185 ; CR 2019/2,
p. 25, para. 40 (Qureshi)). The Judgment of the Court rather laconically
ignores the extensive evidence presented by Pakistan as to the authen-
ticity of Mr. Jadhav’s passport, namely the experts’ report on the subject,
as well as the lack of India’s co-operation in the investigation of the
most serious oﬀences committed by Mr. Jadhav in Pakistan.

  4. In my view, the question of the abuse of rights is closely intertwined
with the fundamental principle of good faith. Article 26 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties is unequivocal when it provides that


527                     jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

“[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be per-
formed by them in good faith”. The rights and obligations stipulated in
an international treaty are to be exercised and performed in accordance
with the object and purpose for which those rights were created. The
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, in its very preamble, reiter-
ates “the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the sovereign equality of States, the maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security, and the promotion of friendly relations among
nations” and that “an international convention on consular relations,
privileges and immunities would also contribute to the development of
friendly relations among nations, irrespective of their diﬀering constitu-
tional and social systems”. Thus, the very object and purpose of this Con-
vention was to promote international peace and security and friendly
relations amongst nations. That object and purpose informed the scope
of application of certain fundamental rights set out in the Convention,
such as Article 36 thereof.

be reconciled with the object and purpose of the Vienna Convention. The
Applicant has clearly abused its right when claiming consular access to its
national who had been instructed to commit serious crimes of terrorism
and espionage in Pakistan. India has provided no rebuttal throughout the
proceedings as to the circumstances in which it had provided an authentic
Indian passport, with false identity, to Mr. Jadhav and the particulars of
Mr. Jadhav’s mission in Pakistan, despite the serious nature of the crimes
he has committed. The Court should have drawn the necessary inferences
therefrom. At the very least, the Court should have taken India’s conduct
into account when determining whether Pakistan has actually breached
its obligations under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention, and ultimately
the nature of any relief. The Court has decided not to do so considering
that “there is no basis under the Vienna Convention for a State to condi-
tion the fulﬁlment of its obligations under Article 36 on the other State’s
compliance with other international law obligations” (see Judgment, para-
graph 123). With all due respect that I owe to the Court, I believe the
Vienna Convention cannot and should not be read in such clinical isola-
tion from general international law.

   6. Moreover, the rights and obligations as set out in paragraph 1 of
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention cannot be construed independently
from its paragraph 2, which expressly qualiﬁes the exercise of those rights
by the sending State and its national when it provides that these “shall be
exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving
State [Pakistan], subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and
regulations must enable full eﬀect to be given to the purposes for which
the rights accorded under this article are intended”.
   7. Since 31 May 2017, Pakistan has sent six requests to India for neces-
sary co-operation in the investigation of the criminal case and about the


528                       jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

passport issue, but these were of no avail (Rejoinder of Pakistan (herein-

for assistance in the investigation in the criminal case registered against
Mr. Jadhav in compliance with the United Nations Security Council reso-
lution 1373 (2001) — oﬀered that “the Government of Pakistan is pre-
pared to consider any request for extradition that the Government of
India may make in the event that Commander Jadhav is considered to be
a criminal under the law of India” (CMP, Vol. 2, Ann. 44). But India
persisted in its non co-operation. Through the same Note Verbale, Paki-
stan speciﬁcally asked six questions to India regarding the authenticity of
the Indian passport (Passport No. L9630722) recovered from Mr. Jad-
hav :
   “(1) [Is] Commander Jadhav . . . indeed Commander Jadhav or ‘Hus-
        sein Mubarak Patel’[?]
    (2) If he is not ‘Hussein Mubarak Patel’, does such a person exist?

      (3) If ‘Hussein Mubarak Patel’ does exist or does not exist, what
          attempts has the Government of India made at the very latest
          since 23rd January 2017 to investigate how Commander Jadhav

          port issued by the competent authorities in India?
      (4) In the alternative, is it the Government of India’s position that
          Commander Jadhav was in possession of a false and inaccurate
          document [such that] either:
          (a) . . . his name is not ‘Hussein Mubarak Patel’; or
          (b) . . . it is not a passport from the competent Indian authorities?

      (5) If that is the case, does the Government of India consider that
          Commander Jadhav has committed a crime or crimes under
          Indian law? If so, what is/are the crimes?
      (6) What is the actual authentic passport for Commander Kulbhu-
          shan Sudhir Jadhav (assuming he was issued with a passport)?
          Please provide full particulars of the date of issue, date of expiry,
          passport number, place of issue, name and photograph in the
          actual (presently valid) passport issued to Commander Jadhav if
          such a document exists . . . [T]he Islamic Republic of Pakistan has
          already put the Republic of India on notice that it has failed to
          establish the Indian nationality of Commander Jadhav.” (CMP,


  8. Subsequent investigation appears to suggest that Mr. Jadhav was in
possession of two Indian passports, one with passport No. E6934766 and


529                       jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

another one No. L9630722. The accounts of three respected Indian jour-
nalists, Mr. Karan Thapar, Mr. Praveen Swami and Mr. Chandan Nandy,
based on interviews conducted with Indian oﬃcials, conﬁrm that Mr. Jad-
hav was a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent (CMP, Vol. 2,
Anns. 27 and 28 ; CR 2019/2, pp. 20-22, paras. 29-33 (Qureshi)). The least
India could have done in the circumstances was to perform searches in its
passport databases to check the authenticity of Mr. Jadhav’s passport
and to furnish that information to the Pakistani authorities so as to facil-
itate further investigation.
   9. After persistent refusal by India to co-operate in the criminal inves-
tigation, Pakistan got the passport examined by an independent forensic
expert who had served in India and Pakistan. His report concluded that
the passport was authentic and genuine and India did not challenge the
veracity of the said report either in its written or oral submissions. In his
report, Mr. Westgate candidly stated as follows :
         “From my knowledge and understanding of the airport immigra-

      holder of an authentic passport, such as an Interpol I24/7 notice, and
      Indian central watch-list entry, criminal proceedings, issues relating
      to identity, these would be very likely to be spotted at the point of
      encounter with the immigration authorities when the passport was
      scrutinised by oﬃcials in India. Such oﬃcials would be examining
      hundreds of passports on a daily basis, and would thus have consid-
      erably more experience in respect of such documents.” (CMP, Vol. 7,
      Ann. 141, para. 15.)
  10. The issuance of such a document and the persistent refusal to
co-operate in the investigation of the same are further contrary to the
United Nations Security Council resolution 1373, which, inter alia, man-

        tion with criminal investigations or criminal proceedings relating
        to the ﬁnancing or support of terrorist acts, including assistance
        in obtaining evidence in their possession necessary for the pro-
        ceedings;

      (g) [p]revent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups by eﬀec-
          tive border controls and controls on issuance of identity papers


530                     jadhav (diss. op. jillani)


   11. India refused to extend assistance to Pakistan on the grounds that
there was no mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) between the two
States. India’s reasoning is not tenable because the absence of such a
treaty would not absolve India of its obligations under the United Nations
Security Council resolutions adopted pursuant to Chapter VII of the
United Nations Charter. India also misrepresents the factual position in
as much as there is a mutual legal agreement, i.e., the 2008 Agreement
which was negotiated over a period of three years and replaced the earlier
agreement which had operated at that time since 1982. It is interesting to
note that point (iii) of the 1982 Agreement contained a provision analo-
gous to point (vi) of the 2008 Agreement, which stipulated as follows :
         “Each Government shall give consular access on reciprocal basis
      to nationals of one country under arrest, detention or imprisonment
      in the other country, provided they are not apprehended for political
      or security reasons/oﬀences. Request for such access and the terms
      thereof shall be considered on the merits of each case by the Govern-
      ment arresting the person or holding the detenus/prisoners and the
      decision on such requests shall be conveyed to the other Government
      within four weeks from the date of receipt of the request.” (Repro-

   12. Although the Court’s jurisdiction only extends to disputes concern-
ing the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention on Con-
sular Relations, it cannot ignore the surrounding legal environment when
considering whether Pakistan has complied with its obligations under
paragraph 1 of Article 36 of that Convention, nor can it be examined
outside the context of strenuous relations and escalating tensions between
the Parties, which pose an imminent threat to peace and security in the
region.
   13. According to Pakistan, Mr. Jadhav was apprehended by security

ing his interrogation as well as in his judicial confession (before a magis-


531                       jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

trate), he admitted that he was working for RAW (Research and Analysis
Wing) and that he had planned and executed acts of terror causing loss of
life and destruction of property in two major areas/cities of Pakistan
(Balochistan and Karachi) with a view to destabilizing Pakistan. He also
named 15 individuals, mostly residing in India, who were his accomplices
and handlers. The extract from his confession is revealing as to the abuse
of rights on the part of India in now bringing these proceedings before
the Court :

   “1. I am Commander Kulbhushan Jadhev Number 41558Z. I am a
       serving oﬃcer of the Indian Navy. I am from the cadre of engineer-
       ing department in the Indian Navy and my cover name was Hus-
       sain Mubarak Patel, which I had adopted for carrying out
       intelligence gathering for the Indian agencies.
    2. I joined National Defence Academy in 1987 and subsequently
       joined the Indian Navy in 1991 and was commissioned in the
       Indian Navy. I served in the Indian Navy till around December

       started contributing my services towards the gathering of informa-
       tion and intelligence within India. I lived in the city of Mumbai in
       India.
    3. I am still a serving oﬃcer in the Indian Navy and will be due for
       retirement by 2022 as a commissioned oﬃcer in the Indian Navy.
       After having completed 14 years of service by 2002, I commenced
       intelligence operations in 2003 and established a small business in
       Chabhahar in Iran. As I was able to achieve undetected existence
       and visited Karachi in 2003 and 2004 and having done some basic
       assignments within India for RAW, I was picked up by RAW in
       end of 2013. Ever since, I have been directing various activities in
       Baluchistan and Karachi at the behest of RAW. I was basically the
       man of Mr. Anil Kumar Gupta who is the Joint Secretary RAW
       and his contacts in Pakistan especially in the Baloch student organ-
       ization.

         out activities with their collaboration. These activities have been of
         criminal nature. These also include anti-national and terrorist
         activities leading to the killing or maiming of the Pakistani citizens.
         I realized during this process that RAW is involved in activities
         related to the Baloch Liberation Movement within Pakistan and
         the region around it. Finances are fed into the Baloch movement
         through various contacts and ways and means into the Baloch lib-
         eration. The activities of these Baloch liberation and RAW han-
         dlers are criminal and anti-Pakistan. Mostly these activities are
         centred around Ports of Gwadar, Pasni, Jeevani and various other
         installations which are around the coast aims to damage the vari-

         border in Iran on 3rd March 2016 and was apprehended by the
         Pakistani authorities on the Pakistani side. The main aim of this
         crossing over into Pakistan was to hold meetings with the BSN
         personnel in Balochistan for carrying out various activities, which
         they were supposed to undertake. I also planned to carry their
         messages to the Indian agencies. The main issues regarding this
         were that they were planning to conduct some operations within
         the immediate future. So that was to be discussed mainly and that
         was the main aim of coming to Pakistan.
      6. So the moment I realized that my intelligence operations ha[d] been
         compromised on my being detained in Pakistan, I revealed that I

hav which it did in accordance with the laws of Pakistan. He was tried by
a special military court (Field General Court Martial), where he was pro-
vided with an independent competent legal attorney and was explained
the various routes of appeal that were available to him. However, with
regard to the terrorism oﬀences, Mr. Jadhav mentioned various accom-
plices, who India did not deny to be residing in India. Thus, Pakistan
requested India’s assistance regarding its investigation into the authentic-
ity of the passport which Mr. Jadhav was carrying, access to his bank and

by him. Due to the fact that India has not co-operated, Mr. Jadhav’s trial


533                      jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

under the terrorism oﬀences has not proceeded. If Pakistan was concoct-
ing false charges and arbitrarily punishing and sentencing Mr. Jadhav,
the Pakistani courts would have found Mr. Jadhav guilty of the various

highlights the bona ﬁde intention of Pakistan to uphold the truth and
dispense justice while the silence and lack of co-operation from India lend
credence to the confession made by Mr. Jadhav, which clearly exposes
India’s involvement. According to Pakistan, Mr. Jadhav’s conduct of per-
petrating acts of terror is part of a chain of acts carried out by India to
destabilize Pakistan. Agent for Pakistan and Pakistan’s Attorney Gen-
eral, Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, stated in his oral submissions :




         “Pakistan, as a consequence of the Indian intervention along with
      others, is a major victim of terrorism where the country and its inno-
      cent citizens continue to ﬁght this menace both inside and on the
      borders. Pakistan has consequentially suﬀered more than 74,000 casu-
      alties and fatalities due to terrorism caused mainly by the interference
      of our neighbour India. It is in this context that Commander Kulb-
      hushan Jadhav, a serving oﬃcer of the Indian Navy, working for
      India’s Research and Analysis Wing (commonly called RAW, India’s
      brutal primary foreign intelligence agency) entered Pakistan, with a
      predetermined aim, on the instructions of the Government of India,

      inces and other places in the country. This much he has admitted
      before an independent judicial magistrate sitting in a court of compe-
      tent jurisdiction with the beneﬁt of stringent safeguards to protect him
      against any form of pressure or coercion when making such a confes-
      sion.” (CR 2019/2, pp. 10-11, para. 5 (Khan).)

   15. India claims that Mr. Jadhav is a retired naval oﬃcer who was
kidnapped from Iran where he was doing business. However, neither in
its Memorial nor in its Reply has India given his date of retirement from

indicate the kind of business he was carrying in Iran or when and how he
was kidnapped. If Mr. Jadhav was in fact kidnapped, as contended by
India, India could have lodged a complaint with the Government of Iran,
but it failed do so (Memorial of India (hereinafter “MI”), para. 41 ; Reply
of India (hereinafter “RI”), para. 31 (e) ; cf. CR 2019/2, para. 35
(Qureshi)). India also neither denied nor aﬃrmed that the passport recov-
ered from Mr. Jadhav was validly issued ; however, it aﬃrms in its plead-
ings that his name is “Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav” and not
“Hussein Mubarak Patel”. Facilitating or sanctioning a serving naval


534                      jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

oﬃcer to penetrate into the social fabric of a sovereign State to undertake
terrorist activities and to conspire destabilization of an entire province in
Pakistan — actions that have led to numerous deaths and destruction of
property — should not have been lightly ignored by the Court.

   16. The issuance of a valid passport with a false Muslim identity and
Mr. Jadhav’s confession demonstrate India’s involvement, its abuse of
process and unlawful conduct. Robert Kolb has described the principle of
“abuse of process” in public international law as a principle that “consists
of the use of procedural instruments or rights by one or more parties for
purposes that are alien to those for which the procedural rights were

case,
      “should have been reason enough for the Court to hold that [the Appli-
      cant] had deprived itself of the necessary locus standi to complain of
      corresponding illegalities on the part of the [Respondent], especially
      because, if these were illegalities, they were consequential on or were
      embarked upon in order to counter the [Applicant’s] own illegality”
      (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
      (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J.
      Reports 1986, dissenting opinion of Judge Schwebel, p. 394, para. 272).

   India and Pakistan and the Question of Arrest and Detention
                  on National Security Grounds

  17. In paragraphs 94-97 of the Judgment, the Court dismissed alto-
gether the relevance of the 2008 Agreement between India and Pakistan
to the present case on two grounds. First, the Court found that
“point (vi) of the Agreement cannot be read as denying consular access
in the case of an arrest, detention or sentence made on political or
security grounds” (Judgment, para. 94). Second, the Court held that
“point (vi) of [the] Agreement does not, as Pakistan contends, displace
the obligations under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention” (ibid.,
para. 97).



535                      jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

   18. The Court’s interpretation of the 2008 Agreement is based on a
presumption and not on two States’ intent as reﬂected in the Agreement.
Moreover, it has misconstrued Article 73 of the Convention. In my view,
the Court has embraced an interpretation of Article 73, paragraph 2, of

of treaties and has not paid due regard to the diﬃculties that this provi-
sion has posed at the time it was being negotiated. As I will show below,
the result of the Court’s interpretation would be tantamount to rendering
Article 73, paragraph 2, redundant and to depriving the States of their
inherent capacity to conclude bilateral treaties inter se in the same subject-
matter as that of a multilateral treaty to which they are both parties.
   19. It may be useful at the outset to recall the gist of the Parties’ plead-
ings on this point. Pakistan submitted that the provisions of the
2008 Agreement give eﬀect to, supplement and amplify the Vienna Con-
vention within the meaning of its Article 73 (CMP, paras. 369 and 385.1).
According to Pakistan, the confession made by Mr. Jadhav and the
nature of charges against him placed the case in the category of “national
security” ; Pakistan was thus entitled to consider consular access of
Mr. Jadhav “on its merits” as stipulated in point (vi) of the 2008 Agree-

that States parties to the Vienna Convention may conclude bilateral
agreements covering the same subject-matter only to the extent that these
conﬁrm, supplement, extend or amplify the provisions of the Vienna
Convention. It also argued that the 2008 Agreement, which was con-
cluded for “furthering the objective of humane treatment of nationals of
either country arrested, detained or imprisoned in the other country”, is
not relevant to the question of the right to consular assistance under the
Vienna Convention. Speciﬁcally, India contended that point (vi) must be

the 2008 Agreement, which deal with the question of early release or
repatriation, on compassionate or humanitarian considerations, which is
not what is in dispute in the present case (MI, paras. 90-92 ; RI, paras. 139,
143-146 ; CR 2019/1, para. 106 (Salve)). Counsel for India, Mr. Har-
ish Salve, in his oral submissions, contended that

      “[c]onsidering that India and Pakistan are neighbours both on land
      and sea, where people who live in the border areas frequently stray
      into the other country and end up in custody, it was found necessary
      to have a bilateral agreement that could supplement the Vienna Con-
      vention. Thus, the matters covered in (sub)paragraphs (i) (iii) (iv)
      and (v) were agreed to and these are not matters covered by the
      Vienna Convention; they supplement and extend the provisions of the
      Vienna Convention.” (CR 2019/1, pp. 31-32, para. 110 (Salve).)

536                      jadhav (diss. op. jillani)

   20. Counsel for India thus admits that matters which fall within the
ambit of points (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the 2008 Agreement are not mat-
ters covered by the Vienna Convention ; they supplement and extend the
provisions thereof. He regrettably does not mention point (vi) (“In case of
arrest, detention or sentence made on political or security grounds, each
side may examine the case on its merits.”). The case of Mr. Jadhav, who
was accused of organizing and executing acts of terror, squarely fell
