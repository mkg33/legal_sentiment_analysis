3. The reasons for my dissent are the following.
4. Very recently, on 14 February 2002, the Court stated:

“The Court would recall the well-established principle that ‘it is
the duty of the Court not only to reply to the questions as stated in
the final submissions of the parties, but also to abstain from deciding
points not included in those submissions’ (Asylum, Judgment, LC.J.
Reports 1950, p. 402). While the Court is thus not entitled to decide
upon questions not asked of it, the non ultra petita rule nonetheless
cannot preclude the Court from addressing certain legal points in its
reasoning.” (Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 ( Democratic Republic
of Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 2002, pp. 18-19,
para. 43.)

5. Neither Cameroon nor Nigeria has requested the Court in its sub-
missions to take note of the commitment undertaken by Cameroon at the
hearings that “it will continue to afford protection to Nigerians living in
the [Bakassi] Peninsula”. Therefore, in my opinion, the Court had to
abstain from taking note of such commitment in the operative part of the
Judgment, even though the Court is entitled to address it in its reasoning,
as it did in paragraph 317 of the Judgment.
