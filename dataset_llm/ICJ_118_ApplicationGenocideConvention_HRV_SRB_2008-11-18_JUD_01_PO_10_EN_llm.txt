 1. The consistency as a purported principle of the majority reasoning

  1. It seems that the principle of judicial consistency understood as
“consistency with its own past case law. . . especially. . . in different
phases of the same case or with regard to closely related cases” (Legality
of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 330, para. 3 ; joint
declaration of Vice-President Ranjeva, Judges Guillaume, Higgins, Kooij-
mans, Al-Khasawneh, Buergenthal and Elaraby) should have been the
essence of the majority reasoning in the present case. Even for the stand-
ards of the Court itself in whose jurisprudence the principle of consist-
ency has a prominent place, there is a conspicuous reference to the course
“not. . . to depart from previous findings, particularly when similar issues
were dealt with in the earlier decisions, as in the current case” (Judgment,
para. 104) or similarly couched (exempli causa, ibid., paras. 53, 54, 71,
76, 141).

   2. The consistency as such may in concreto be evaluated at three lev-
els :
(a) consistency in casu (horizontal consistency) ;
(b) limited vertical consistency, i.e., consistency in cases in which the
      Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)/Serbia was involved as a
      party ; and
(c) general vertical consistency in terms of the consistency of decisions
      taken by the Court in cases in which the FRY/Serbia was involved,
      in the light of the general jurisprudence of the Court on relevant
      issues.
   3. It appears that the application of the principle of consistency in casu
was a difficult task, as regards the jus standi of the FRY/Serbia even an
impossible mission, due to heterogeneous decisions taken by the Court in


                                                          uA)
the earlier cases in that respect as well as in respect of the status of the
FRY/Serbia vis-à-vis the United Nations as its determinative.

  4. In that regard, the decisions of the Court in the earlier cases may be
divided into three groups :
(a) decisions based on avoiding or ignoring the position as regards the
    jus standi of the FRY/Serbia ;
(b) decisions involving some elements or indicae of the jus standi of the
    FRY/Serbia ; and
(c) decisions based on substantive assessment, whether positive or nega-
    tive, of the jus standi of the FRY/Serbia.
  5. The explicit avoidance position was taken by the Court in its Orders
of 8 April 1993 in the Bosnia case and 2 June 1999 in the Legality of Use
of Force cases. In its Order of 8 April 1993 the Court found, inter alia,
that in resolution 47/1 “the solution. . . is not free from legal difficulties”
(Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro)) , Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993, I.C.J.
Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 18), but decided that the question is one which
“the Court does not need to determine definitively at the present stage of
the proceedings” (ibid.).
  Since the FRY/Serbia could have the status of a party in the Court
only on the basis of its membership in the United Nations, the meaning
of the finding regarding the jus standi of the FRY is that it, as such, “is
not free of legal difficulties”. That position was slightly modified in its
Order of 2 June 1999 by stating that it “need not consider this question
for the purpose of deciding whether or not it can indicate provisional
measures in the present case” (Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v.
Belgium), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999, I.C.J. Reports
1999 (I), p. 136, para. 33).

   6. In the Judgment on Preliminary Objections in the Bosnia case,
which would have been the proper place for the decision as to whether
the fundamental condition of jus standi (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia
and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 2004 (I), pp. 298-299, para. 46) had been fulfilled, the Court put
the issue of the jus standi of the FRY under the carpet. It satisfied itself
by the finding that “Yugoslavia was bound by the provisions of the Con-
vention on the date of the filing of the Application” (Application of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, I.C.J.
Reports 1996 (II), p. 610, para. 17) and since Bosnia and Herzegovina
“became a Member of the United Nations. . . on 22 May 1992” (ibid.,

the jurisdiction of the Court ratione personae” (Application of the Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bos-
nia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, I.C.J.
Reports 1996 (II), p. 613, para. 26). The approach could be called the
implicit avoiding position or, perhaps more properly, the ignoring posi-
tion as regards the jus standi of the FRY. (The implicit avoiding position
is basically the substance of the joint declaration of seven judges on the
Legality of Use of Force cases also ((Serbia and Montenegro v. Bel-
gium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I),
pp. 330-334.) For, if the Court would consider itself not competent on
considerations ratione temporis and ratione materiae, as was argued in
the joint declaration, then the question of the jus standi of the FRY
would be set aside, and would be substantially disqualified as an anteced-
ent condition of the jurisdiction of the Court.)
   7. In the decisions of the Court involving some elements or indicae of
substantive assessment of the jus standi of the FRY, one could include
the Order of 8 April 1993 in the case concerning Application of the Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and
the 2003 Judgment in the Application for Revision case.
   The Order of 8 April 1993, apart from the finding that the solution
adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/1 “is not free from legal dif-

     “proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
     which is a party to. . . a special provision in a treaty in force, but is
     not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
     down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946 (cf. S.S.
     “Wimbledon”, 1923, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 1, p. 6)” (para. 19 of the
     Order)1 .
   In its Judgment in the Application for Revision case (Application for

tions (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2003, p. 7), the Court entered into the assessment of both the jus standi of
the FRY and its determinative — the status of the FRY vis-à-vis the
United Nations. As regards the status of the FRY vis-à-vis the United
Nations a notion sui generis of membership was constructed.
   8. The Court, considering General Assembly resolution 55/12 of 1
November 2000 by which FRY/Serbia was admitted to the United
Nations as a new Member, points out, inter alia, that it


  1 The consideration proved to be erroneous in the light of the eight Judgments of the

Court in the Legality of Use of Force cases ((Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), I.C.J.
Reports 2004 (I), pp. 323-324, paras. 113-114).

      “cannot have changed retroactively the sui generis position which
      the FRY found itself in vis-à-vis the United Nations over the period
      1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court
      and the Genocide Convention. Furthermore, the letter of the Legal
      Counsel of the United Nations dated 8 December 2000, cannot have
      affected the FRY’s position in relation to treaties.” (Application for
      Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning
      Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
      the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia),
      Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina),
      Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 71.)

  (Apart from the substantive validity of the position taken, two obser-
vations seem to be of interest. First, the assessment of the status of the
FRY took place almost a decade after Bosnia and Herzegovina submit-
ted its Application to the Court, and over four years since the admission
of the FRY to the United Nations as a new Member. Second, the assess-
ment is, by its nature, an obiter dictum exceeding the competence of the
Court in the revision procedure which, in the sense of Article 61 of the
Statute, should have confined itself to the issue whether the admission of
the FRY to the United Nations as such is a “new fact”.)


   Regarding the jus standi of the FRY, the Court noted that : “Resolu-
tion 47/1 did not inter alia affect the FRY’s right to appear before the
Court. . . under the conditions laid down by the Statute. Nor did it affect
the position of the FRY in relation to the Genocide Convention.” (Ibid.,
p. 31, para. 70.)
   9. The Court performed substantial assessment of jus standi in two
cases : in the Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court found that the
FRY was deprived of the right to appear before it due to the fact that in
the period 1992-2000 Serbia and Montenegro was not a Member of the
United Nations and, consequently, “did not. . . have access to the Court
under either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of Article 35 of the Statute”
(Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 327, para. 127),
while in the 2007 Judgment in the case concerning Application of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide it
found, through the form of decision by “necessary implication”, that Ser-
bia did have access to the Court (I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), pp. 98-99,
para. 132).

  10. In the jurisprudence of the Court, taken as a whole, the cases in
which the issue of access was status versiae et controversiae are rare
because of the practically universal nature of the United Nations and
because of the equality sign between the membership in the Organization
and the jus standi before the Court. Along with the cases in which the


                                                           uA)
FRY/Serbia was involved, the list of relevant cases included the Mon-
etary Gold and Fisheries cases. In all these cases the Court followed a
uniform pattern in its reasoning. Exempli causa, in the Fisheries Jurisdic-
tion (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland) case, the Court stated
inter alia :
      “the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland seemed to suggest that
      the timing of the declaration of the Federal Republic of Germany of
      29 October 1971, deposited with the Registrar on 22 November
      1971, may have had some effect on the binding force of the agree-
      ment contained in the Exchange of Notes of 19 July 1961 or on the
      right of access to the Court of the Federal Republic of Germany. As
      to the first point, it is clear that the binding force of the agreement
      between the two Governments, which is to be examined in the
      present Judgment, bears no relation to the date on which the declara-
      tion required by the Security Council resolution of 15 October 1946
      was deposited with the Registrar : the former is designed to establish
      the jurisdiction of the Court over a particular kind of dispute ; the
      latter provides for access to the Court of States which are not parties
      to the Statute. As to the second point (i.e., the question of the Fed-
      eral Republic’s right of access to the Court), according to the Secu-
      rity Council resolution, a declaration, which may be either particular
      or general, must be filed by the State which is not a party to the Stat-
      ute, previously to its appearance before the Court. This was done.”
      (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 53, para. 11 ; emphasis added.)

   11. It comes out that in the series of decisions taken by the Court as
regards the jus standi of the FRY/Serbia, the Judgments on the Legality
of Use of Force cases are the only ones in conformity with the general
jurisprudence of the Court in the matter. In its reasoning part, the Judg-
ment substantiates the basic elements of the jus standi as defined by Arti-
cle 35 of the Statute in terms of an autonomous processual condition of
antecedent and mandatory nature distinguishable from jurisdiction of the
Court stricto sensu. The Court found, inter alia, that
      “the question whether Serbia and Montenegro was or was not a
      party to the Statute of the Court at the time of the institution of the
      present proceedings is fundamental ; for if it were not such a party,
      the Court would not be open to it under Article 35, paragraph 1, of
      the Statute. In that situation, subject to any application of para-
      graph 2 of that Article, Serbia and Montenegro could not have
      properly seised the Court, whatever title of jurisdiction it might have
      invoked, for the simple reason that Serbia and Montenegro did not
      have the right to appear before the Court.
        The Court can exercise its judicial function only in respect of those
      States which have access to it under Article 35 of the Statute. And
      only those States which have access to the Court can confer jurisdic-


                                                          uA)
     tion upon it.” (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v.
     Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I),
     pp. 298-299, para. 46 ; see also pp. 292-293, para. 29.)
  12. In addition, the finding that “at the time of filing of its Application
to institute the present proceedings before the Court on 29 April 1999,
the Applicant. . . was not a Member of the United Nations” (ibid., p. 314,
para. 91) was, as time has shown, of far-reaching importance. The Court
accepted it in the Judgment of 2007 in the case concerning Application
of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide and in the present Judgment after more than one decade of
wandering between the Scylla of avoiding position, and the Haribda of
sui generis position, a sort of tertium quid between membership and
non-membership of the FRY in the United Nations.

   13. However, it should be noted that stricti juris even the 2004 Judg-
ment is not free from inconsistency. It regards the disharmony between
the dispositif of the Judgment with its ratio decidendi. While the reason-
ing part of the Judgment is strictly formulated in terms of the right of the
FRY to access to the Court under Article 35, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the
Statute (ibid., p. 298, paras. 46 ; pp. 310-311, para. 79 ; pp. 314-315, para. 91
and p. 327, para. 126), its dispositif concerns exclusively the “jurisdiction
to entertain the claims” (ibid., p. 328, para. 129 ; emphasis added). The
inconsistency between the dispositif and the ratio decidendi is even greater,
because the Court did not deal with the issue of jurisdiction stricto sensu,
sticking to the basic assumption that it must determine whether the FRY
meets the conditions laid down in Article 35 of the Statute before exam-
ining the conditions in Articles 36 and 37 of the Statute. Therefore, the
Court concluded that the fact that

       “Serbia and Montenegro did not, at the time of the institution of the
       present proceedings, have access to the Court. . . makes it unneces-
       sary for the Court to consider the other preliminary objections filed
       by the Respondents to the jurisdiction of the Court” (ibid., pp. 327-
       328, para. 127; emphasis added).
   14. It appears that the jurisdiction of the Court, in the cases in which
the FRY/Serbia was involved as a party, is far from consistent at all three
levels of its evaluation. The very fact that the Court, in dealing with an
identical issue in the different phases of the same case, or in closely
related cases, applied the three basic, mutually exclusive modus faciendi,
is, if not by itself an answer to the question whether the Court acted in a
consistent manner or not, at the very least represents a strong indiciae in
that regard.
   It is difficult to discuss in terms of substantial consistency the decisions
of the Court based on the avoiding position. For, the decisions regarding
the jus standi of the FRY/Serbia, taken sub silentio, either by accepting
the factual presumptions (praesumptio facti vel homine) about the con-


                                                           uA)
tinuity and legal identity (1996 Judgment in the case concerning Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide) or by the constructions which keep them indirectly in force
(2007 Judgment in the same case) do not give real answers to the question
which is cardinal for the legality of the Court’s judicial activity. Decisions
based on the substantial assessment of jus standi, although in contrast to
those based on avoidance, represent the expression of a proper judicial
action, are diametrically opposed in the determination of the jus standi of
the FRY/Serbia. Indiciae or elements of the substantial assessment of jus
standi, since they are not, by themselves, decisions and, moreover, were
not an element of the proper decisions on the issue, demonstrate the
scope of the inconsistency in the legal reasoning.

  15. The conclusion follows that the only consistency of the decisions
of the Court regarding jus standi of the FRY/Serbia is found in the
inconsistency of the decisions per se and in its ratio decidendi. And, if the
purpose of consistency is, inter alia, to “provide predictability” (joint
declaration of Vice-President Ranjeva, Judges Guillaume, Higgins, Kooij-
mans, Al-Khasawneh, Buergenthal and Elaraby, Legality of Use of Force
(Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 330, para. 3) “in different phases of the same
case or with regard to closely related cases” (ibid.), it is not clear what
that predictability would consist of in those cases in which the FRY/Ser-
bia was a party, except, perhaps, that the FRY/Serbia has jus standi as a
respondent, and that it is deprived of it as an applicant.


   16. The jurisdiction of the Court regarding the status of the FRY/Ser-
bia as a Contracting Party to the Genocide Convention is seemingly con-
sistent. In the different phases of the case concerning Application of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia) as well as in the provisional
measures phase of the Legality of Use of Force cases, the Court basically
adopted the finding that the FRY/Serbia may be considered as bound by
the Genocide Convention on the basis of intention, as expressed in the
declaration adopted on 27 April 1992


      “to remain bound by the international treaties to which the former
      Yugoslavia was party. . . confirmed in an official Note of 27 April
      1992 from the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United
      Nations” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Pun-
      ishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugo-
      slavia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II),
      p. 610, para. 17 ; see also Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v.
      United Kingdom), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999,
      I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 838, para. 32).


                                                           uA)
The finding acquired, in the merits phase of the case concerning Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide, the res indicata status and is in part reaffirmed in the present
Judgment, too (para. 11). So, in terms of horizontal as well as limited
vertical consistency, it seems that the Court acted almost semper idem.
The precedental authority of the finding is, however, in doubt in terms of
substantive consistency.
   First of all, the qualification of the 1992 declaration as a unilateral
legal act capable of producing the proper effects per se, seems to be
inconsistent with the relevant rules of international law as expressed in
the jurisprudence of the Court (paras. 121-128 below).
   Even if ex hypothesis the 1992 declaration may be considered as such
an act, well-settled rules in the jurisprudence of the Court regarding the
interpretation of unilateral acts could hardly lead to the conclusion
reached by the Court (para. 132 below).

   17. Two additional considerations are of interest also.
   Although in the present Judgment as well, the majority reaffirms the
dispositif of the decisions of the Court adopted in the earlier cases related
to the Genocide Convention, its legal reasoning is not consistent in that
