                      1. I am not fully convinced by the finding of the Court that, “by auth­
                    orizing fishing activities in the Republic of Nicaragua’s exclusive economic
                    zone, the Republic of Colombia has violated the Republic of Nicaragua’s
                    sovereign rights and jurisdiction in this maritime zone” (Judgment, sub-
                    para. 3 of the dispositif). The following paragraphs address why I believe
                    Nicaragua has failed to substantiate this claim.

                      2. In my view, Nicaragua did not provide sufficient evidence to prove
                    that Colombia issued permits to Colombian and foreign-­flagged vessels
                    authorizing them to fish in areas appertaining to Nicaragua’s exclusive
                    economic zone (hereinafter “EEZ”). In particular, I am not convinced by
                    the majority’s assessment of the available evidence relating to the alleged
                    incidents at sea, which were relied upon to justify the conclusion in sub-
                    paragraph 3 of the dispositif. The Court has consistently emphasized in its
                    jurisprudence that it
                          “will treat with caution evidentiary materials specially prepared for
                          this case and also materials emanating from a single source. It will
                          prefer contemporaneous evidence from persons with direct knowl-
                          edge. It will give particular attention to reliable evidence acknowledg-
                          ing facts or conduct unfavourable to the State represented by the
                          person making them” 1.

                    In addition, the Court has consistently held that the value of government
                    reports
                          “depends, among other things, on (1) the source of the item of evi-
                          dence (for instance partisan, or neutral), (2) the process by which it

                          has been generated (for instance an anonymous press report or the
                          product of a careful court or court-like process), and (3) the quality
                          or character of the item (such as statements against interest, and
                          agreed or uncontested facts)” 2.

                       3. The main evidentiary source for the incidents alleged by Nicaragua
                    are the “Daily Navy Reports”, as well as a letter from the Nicaraguan
                    Naval Force, all of which seem to have been prepared specifically for the
                    purpose of the current proceedings and emanate from a single, partisan
                    source. Accordingly, they can only be awarded limited probative value.
                    Admittedly, some incidents are also supported by additional audio
                    recordings. However, for a number of such recordings, there is no way to
                    assess the date and location of their creation, nor are the recordings
                    always clear about the precise circumstances of the exchange.
                       4. Moreover, even if conclusively proven, I remain unconvinced that
                    said incidents at sea necessarily lead to the conclusion that Colombia has
                    authorized unlawful fishing activities in Nicaragua’s EEZ. While Colom-
                    bian ships did indeed in some instances accompany Colombian and
                    foreign-­flagged vessels engaged in unauthorized fishing in the Luna Verde
                    area, this cannot be equated with the authorization of such fishing. There
                    can be no requirement for Colombia’s naval frigates to dissociate them-
                    selves from private fishing activities in Nicaragua’s EEZ 3. These incidents
                    cannot be relied on to remedy, by way of inference, the additional eviden-
                    tiary defects in relation to the resolutions issued by the General Maritime
                    Directorate of the Ministry of National Defence of Colombia (hereinafter
                    “DIMAR”) and the Governor of the Department of the Archipelago of
                    San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (hereinafter “Governor of
                    the Archipelago”).


                       5. In this regard, I am not certain the relevant resolutions adopted by
                    DIMAR and the Governor of the Archipelago constitute fishing permits
                    in the first place. In particular, it remains unclear whether DIMAR is an
                    authority that is competent to issue such permits, as opposed to a body in
                    charge of merely prescribing technical arrangements. It is the responsibil-
                    ity of Nicaragua, as the Party alleging the fact, to discharge the burden of
                    proof in line with the principle of onus probandi incumbit actori, and dem-
                    onstrate that these authorities are in fact competent to issue fishing per-
                    mits 4. However, Nicaragua has not responded to Colombia’s argument

                       6. In addition, even when assuming that DIMAR and the Governor of
                    the Archipelago are competent authorities, and that said resolution actu-
                    ally constitutes fishing permits, I remain unconvinced that there is suffi-
                    cient evidence to conclude that any authorization granted by these permits
                    extends to areas appertaining to Nicaragua’s EEZ. The only reference to
                    the areas of Luna Verde or La Esquina appears in the preambular section
                    of two “permits”, and not in their operative parts. These operative parts
                    define the authorized fishing grounds as “the area of the Department of
                    San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina” and include no reference to
                    Luna Verde or La Esquina 6. In its response to Nicaragua’s allegations,
                    Colombia specifically highlighted these facts. However, Nicaragua again
                    chose not to address this issue in the oral hearings.

                      7. In light of these considerations, I have difficulties supporting the
                    conclusion expressed in subparagraph 3 of the dispositif that Colombia
                    has violated Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its exclusive
                    economic zone by authorizing fishing in this maritime zone. For this rea-
                    son, I also voted against subparagraph 4 of the dispositif, which orders
                    Colombia to cease conduct that was found to be unlawful in the two
                    preceding paragraphs. However, I disagree with subparagraph 4 only in
                    so far as it relates to subparagraph 3. In contrast, I support the finding
                    that Colombia must cease to interfere with fishing and marine scientific
                    research activities of Nicaraguan-­flagged or Nicaraguan-­licensed vessels
                    as expressed in subparagraph 4 of the dispositif.
