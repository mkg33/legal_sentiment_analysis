Having taken its decision concerning sovereignty over the Hawar
Islands, the Court had to deal with another problem. In accordance
with the relevant provisions of customary international law — which are
contained in Article 12, paragraph 1, of the 1958 Convention on the
Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone and in Article 15 of the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — the single maritime
boundary that the Court was to draw in fact passes through the narrow,
shallow channel that separates the islands of the Hawar group from
the Qatar peninsula, a channel that is unnavigable. Consequently, local
sea traffic between the southern and northern parts of the western coast
of Qatar must follow routes to the west of the Hawar Islands.

In view of this fact, the Court considered it necessary to point out that,
as Bahrain was not entitled to apply the method of straight baselines, the
waters lying between the Hawar Islands and the other Bahraini islands
were not internal waters of Bahrain, but the territorial sea of that State.
In point 2 /b) of the operative part of the Judgment, it stated that vessels
of the State of Qatar enjoy in the territorial sea of Bahrain separating the
Hawar Islands from the other Bahraini islands the right of innocent
passage accorded by customary international law.

I take this opportunity to express my agreement on this matter and to
point out that these very important statements have enabled me to vote
in favour of paragraph 6 of the operative part of the Judgment, which
defines the single maritime boundary that divides the maritime areas of
the two States party to the dispute.
