                        1. According to paragraph 129 of the 2008 Judgment (Application of
                     the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
                     (Croatia v. Serbia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008,
                     p. 460), the Court needed to assess the merits in order to determine the
                     two “inseparable issues” of jurisdiction and admissibility 1. Yet, in the
                     present Judgment, the determination that the Court has jurisdiction is
                     made prior to examining any element of the merits and is detached from
                     the issue of admissibility. I agree with this approach. It is clear from the
                     well‑established jurisprudence of the Court that the issues of jurisdiction
                     and admissibility are undoubtedly separable and that jurisdiction must
                     be, and has always been, decided first. Secondly, the issue of jurisdiction
                     in the present case can be decided by the Court without examining the
                     merits. Indeed, the Judgment does not rely on any element of the merits
                     in order to determine jurisdiction. It is also worth noting that, in adopt-
                     ing this approach, the Court makes it clear that the issue of attribution
                     under the general rules of State responsibility may not be conflated or
                     combined with the issue of consent‑based jurisdiction 2.

                     clusion as to jurisdiction. In paragraph 117 of the Judgment, the Court
                     states that
                           “[h]aving concluded in its 2008 Judgment that the present dispute falls
                           within Article IX of the Genocide Convention in so far as it concerns
                           acts said to have occurred after 27 April 1992, the Court now finds
                           that, to the extent that the dispute concerns acts said to have occurred
                           before that date [the date on which the FRY came into existence], it
                           also falls within the scope of Article IX and that the Court therefore
                           has jurisdiction to rule upon the entirety of Croatia’s claim” 3.

                     However, it is not sufficient that there is a dispute between the Parties
                     that falls within the scope of Article IX. The existence of a dispute is a
                     requisite element of jurisdiction. Yet, as the Court has stated on innumer-
                     able occasions, it is the fundamental principle of consent which forms the
                     basis of jurisdiction. The Judgment completely disregards the issue of
                     consent by confusing jurisdiction with applicable law. Paragraph 115 of
                     the present Judgment seeks to rely on paragraph 149 of the 2007 Judg-
                     ment in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
                     the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Monte­
                     negro) (I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), p. 105), even though this latter paragraph
                     dealt with the identification of the applicable law beyond the Genocide
                     Convention. This is undoubtedly a task which the Court must undertake
                     once it has established that it has jurisdiction. Indeed, this is precisely
                     what the Court does in the present Judgment ; having found, erroneously,
                     in my view, that it has jurisdiction, the Court goes on to make a state-
                     ment, in paragraph 125, which is identical in substance to that made in
                     paragraph 149 of the 2007 Judgment, stating, inter alia, that
                           “[i]n ruling on disputes relating to the interpretation, application or
                           fulfilment of the Convention, including those relating to the respon-
                           sibility of a State for genocide, the Court bases itself on the Conven-
                           tion, but also on the other relevant rules of international law, in
                           particular those governing the interpretation of treaties and the
                           responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts”.

                        3 The Court, in its 2008 Judgment, when considering Serbia’s first preliminary objec-

                     tion, dealt not with the issue of whether the dispute fell within Article IX of the Geno-
                     cide Convention, but rather with the question of whether Croatia had validly instituted
                     proceedings against Serbia, in accordance with Article 35 of the Statute of the Court,
                     given that the latter was not a Member of the United Nations as of the date of the filing
                     of the Application (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
                     the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
                     Reports 2008, pp. 429‑444, paras. 57‑92), and with the question of whether Serbia was
                     a party to the Genocide Convention at the date of the filing of the Application (ibid.,
                     pp. 444‑455, paras. 93‑117). Serbia’s third preliminary objection related to whether certain
                     Croatian claims, concerning the submission of certain persons to trial, information on
                     missing persons and the return of cultural property, had become moot (ibid., pp. 460‑465,
                     paras. 131‑144).

                     196 	application of genocide convention (sep. op. skotnikov)

                     However, identifying the law which would have been applicable if the
                     Court had jurisdiction is no substitute for establishing that the Court has
                     jurisdiction under Article IX of the Genocide Convention. The task
                     before the Court in the present Judgment was either to identify the legal
                     mechanism by which the FRY assumed obligations under the Genocide
                     Convention before it came into existence, or to determine that no such
                     legal mechanism existed.

                        3. Ultimately, the Court does neither. It merely suggests that obliga-
                     tions under the Genocide Convention might be applicable to the FRY
                     before 27 April 1992 by virtue, as Croatia argues, of succession to respon-
                     sibility. Then it transforms this preliminary issue into a question for the
                     merits (see Judgment, para. 117), and goes on to consider whether acts
                     contrary to the Genocide Convention took place prior to 27 April 1992.
                     After answering this question in the negative, the Court does not return
                     to the issue of succession to responsibility.

                        4. Had this issue been dealt with as a preliminary one, as it should
                     have been, in order to demonstrate Serbia’s consent to the Court’s juris-
                     diction, the Court would have had to establish that the doctrine of succes-
                     sion to responsibility was part of general international law at the time of
                     Serbia’s succession to the Genocide Convention on 27 April 1992. This is,
                     of course, an impossible task, since there is no jurisprudence or State
                     practice to support this hypothesis.

                        5. Moreover, the Court clearly pointed towards rejection of the notion
                     of succession to responsibility when it decided, both in its 2007 Bosnia
                     Judgment and in its 2008 Judgment on preliminary objections in this case,
                     that Montenegro, a successor State to Serbia and Montenegro (formerly
                     the FRY), had not consented to the jurisdiction of the Court and could
                     not be a Respondent in the respective cases (Application of the Convention
                     on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
                     Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I),
                     pp. 75‑76, paras. 75‑77 ; Application of the Convention on the Prevention
                     and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Preliminary
                     Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 423, paras. 32‑33). Likewise,
                     the FRY (now Serbia) is a successor State to the SFRY. Like Monte­
                     negro, in respect of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Serbia did
                     not inherit the right to the international legal personality of the SFRY.
                     Like Montenegro, Serbia did not accept responsibility in the present case
                     for the conduct of its predecessor State, and thus did not consent to the
                     Court’s jurisdiction in respect of that State. In spite of this, the Court sees
                     no jurisdictional problems in identifying the following questions that
                     would need to be decided in order to determine whether Serbia is respon-
                     sible for the alleged violations of the Genocide Convention :

                        “(1) whether the acts relied on by Croatia [prior to the date on which
                             the FRY came into existence] took place ; and, if they did, whether
                             they were contrary to the Convention ;
                         (2) if so, whether those acts were attributable to the SFRY at the time
                             that they occurred and engaged its responsibility ; and

                           (3) if the responsibility of the SFRY had been engaged, whether the
                               FRY succeeded to that responsibility” (Judgment, para. 112).
                     The fact that the Court limits itself to answering only the first question
                     does not render this “three‑step solution” any more tenable. I cannot see
                     how this construction could possibly be justified by the Court’s obvious
                     observation that the SFRY, whose responsibility or lack thereof the
                     Court is prepared to determine, “no longer exists . . . no longer possesses
                     any rights and is incapable of giving or withholding consent to the juris-
                     diction of the Court” (ibid., para. 116).

                     to the 2007 Judgment, that nothing in Article IX suggests that the Court
                     is empowered to go beyond settling disputes relating to State responsibil-
                     ity for genocide and other acts enumerated in Article III of the Genocide
                     Convention 7. As to whether or not the crime of genocide or other Arti-
                     cle III acts have been committed, the Court’s role is limited by its lack of
                     criminal jurisdiction. For this reason, the Court, for example, lacks the
                     capacity to establish the existence of genocidal intent, since the Genocide
                     Convention addresses genocidal intent solely in the context of a criminal
                     procedure, as a necessary mental element of the crime of genocide and
                     other acts contrary to the Convention. Of course, genocidal intent may be
                     inferred from a pattern of events, yet this task remains one for a compe-
                     tent criminal tribunal (the ICTY in the present case). The Court’s role is
                     to determine whether it has been sufficiently established that acts pro-
                     scribed by the Genocide Convention were committed (see paragraph 14
                     below). After making this determination, the Court must then continue to
                     deal with its primary task of addressing the question of State responsibil-
                     ity for genocide.

                     with this conclusion, but I have doubts about the way in which the Court
                     arrives at this finding.
                        12. When engaging in the exercise of determining the existence or
                     non‑existence of the actus reus and dolus specialis of the crime of geno-
                     cide, the Court deals with matters which it is ill‑equipped to resolve. It is
                     curious that, in the sections devoted to consideration of the merits of the
                     principal claim and counter‑claim, reference is made to genocide, rather

                     than to the crime of genocide. This attempt to get around the fact that the

                        13. At the same time, it is axiomatic that States can be held responsible
                     for genocide through the mechanism of attribution, as, in general, wher-
                     ever international law criminalizes an act, a State can be held responsible
                     if that criminal act is committed by individuals capable of engaging such
                     responsibility. The rules of State responsibility in this respect are rather
                     straightforward. Indeed, they are referred to as applicable law in the pres-
                     ent Judgment (see paragraph 125) 8.

                       14. In the present case, in order to make a determination as to whether
                     the crime of genocide and other acts enumerated in Article III of the
                     Genocide Convention have been committed, instead of insisting on the
                     Court’s capacity to conduct its own enquiry to this end, it would have
                     been sufficient to have taken notice of the relevant proceedings of the
                     ICTY. These proceedings, of course, have never involved any charges of
                     genocide in respect of events in Croatia. It is worth recalling that this
                     Court has recognized that the ICTY is an international penal tribunal in
                     accordance with Article VI of the Genocide Convention (Application of
                     the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
                     (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J.
                     Reports 2007 (I), p. 227, para. 445). Thus, in these proceedings, as in the
                     Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro case, the Court was in
                     the “ideal” situation in that, for almost a quarter of a century now, there
                     has been an international penal tribunal possessing jurisdiction with
                     respect to the region in question and to the States involved 9. As a matter

                         8 Thankfully, the Court, in the present Judgment, does not return to the rather artifi-

                     cial and unnecessary notion featured in the 2007 Judgment of States themselves commit-
                     ting crimes punishable under the Genocide Convention (Application of the Convention on
                     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia
                     and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), pp. 113‑114, paras. 166‑169).
                         9 Hypothetically, there may be circumstances where no such tribunal exists but where,

                     for instance, the parties agree that genocide did indeed take place ; or where the occur-
                     rence of genocide is so manifest as not to require further elucidation, being, for example,
                     reflected in an open State policy ; or where the claims of genocide are manifestly concocted.
                     In such circumstances, the Court could address the issue of State responsibility, or the lack
                     thereof, without the risk of foraying into the field of criminal culpability. However, these
                     and other hypotheticals should be left for another day, which, I sincerely hope, will never
                     come. That is to say, I hope that no situation ever arises which would make this Court
                     address the responsibility of a State for genocide.
