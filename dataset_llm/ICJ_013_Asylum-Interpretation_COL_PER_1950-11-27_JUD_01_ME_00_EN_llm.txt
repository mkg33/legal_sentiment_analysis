“The judgment is final and without appeal. In the event of
dispute as to the meaning or scope of the judgment, the Court
shall contrue it upon the request of any party.”

Thus it lays down two conditions for the admissibility of such a
request :

(1) The real purpose of the request must be to obtain an inter-
pretation of the judgment. This signifies that its object must
be solely to obtain clarification of the meaning and the scope
of what the Court has decided with binding force, and not to
obtain an answer to questions not so decided. Any other
construction of Article 60 of the Statute would nullify the
provision of the article that the judgment is final and without
appeal.

(2) In addition, it is necessary that there should exist a dispute
as to the meaning or scope of the judgment.

one must bear in mind the principle that it is the duty of the Court
not only to reply to the questions as stated in the final submissions
of the parties, but also to abstain from deciding points not included
in those submissions.

The three questions raised in this proceeding by the Colombian
Government must be considered in the light of this principle.

The first question concerns the qualification which was in fact
made by the Colombian Ambassador at Lima of the offence imputed
to the refugee. It seeks to obtain from the Court a declaration that
this qualification was correct and that legal effect should be attrib-
uted to it: The Court finds that this point was not raised in the
submissions of the Colombian Government in the proceedings
leading up to the Judgment of November zoth, 1950. In those
submissions, the Court was asked to pronounce only on the claim
expressed in abstract and general terms, that Colombia as the
country granting asylum, was competent to qualify the offence by
a unilateral and final decision binding on Peru.

The circumstance that, before the proceedings in Court in the
principal case, the qualification which was in fact made by the
Colombian Ambassador had given rise to discussions between the
two Governments through a diplomatic correspondence is irrelevant.
As regards that part of the counter-claim of the Peruvian Govern-
ment which was based on a violation of Article 1, paragraph 1, of
the Havana Convention of 1928, it is to be noted that, in order to
decide this question, it was sufficient for the Court to examine
whether the Peruvian Government had proved that Haya de la
Torre was accused of common crimes prior to the granting of



asylum, namely, January 3rd, 1949. The Court found that this had
not been proved by the Peruvian Government. The Court did not
decide any other question on this point.

Questions 2 and 3 are submitted as alternatives, and may be
dealt with together. Both concern the surrender of the refugee to
the Peruvian Government and the possible obligations resulting
in this connexion, for Colombia, from the Judgment of Novem-
ber zoth, 1950. The Court can only refer to what it declared in its
Judgment in perfectly definite terms : this question was completely
left outside the submissions of the Parties. The judgment in no
way decided it, nor could it do so. It was for the Parties to present
their respective claims on this point. The Court finds that they did
nothing of the kind.

The “gaps” which the Colombian Government claims to have
discovered in the Court’s Judgment in reality are new questions,
which cannot be decided by means of interpretation. Interpretation
can in no way go beyond the limits of the Judgment, fixed in
advance by the Parties themselves in their submissions.

Article 60 of the Statute provides, moreover, that interpretation
may be asked only if there is a “dispute as to the meaning or scope
of the judgment”. Obviously, one cannot treat as a dispute, in the
sense of that provision, the mere fact that one Party finds the judg-
ment obscure when the other considers it to be perfectly clear. A
dispute requires a divergence of views between the parties on
definite points; Article 79, paragraph 2, of the Rules confirms
this condition by stating that the application for interpretation
“shall specify the precise point or points in dispute”.

It is evident that this condition does not exist in the present case.
Not only has the existence of a dispute between the Parties not been
brought to the attention of the Court, but the very date of the
Colombian Government’s request for interpretation shows that
such a dispute could not possibly have arisen in any way whatever.

The Court thus finds that the requirements of Article 60 of the

Statute and of Article 79, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, have
not been satisfied.

FOR THESE REASONS,
THE COURT,
by twelve votes to one,

Declares the request for interpretation of the Judgment of
November 20th, 1950, presented on the same day by the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Colombia, to be inadmissible.

M. Caicepo CASTILLA, Judge ad hoc, declares that he is unable
to concur in the Judgment of the Court because, in his opinion,
Article 60 of the Statute can be interpreted more liberally, as shown
by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzôw
Factory case. He recognizes, however, that it is open to the Parties
to come before the Court if a divergence of views satisfying the
precise conditions required by this Judgment were to be submitted
to it.
