Case one of eight similar cases brought by the Applicant — Court to consider
arguments put forward in this case as well as any other legal issue, including
issues raised in other seven cases.

* +

Contentions by Respondents that case should be dismissed in limine litis as a
result of Applicant’s changed attitude to Court’s jurisdiction in its Observations.

Whether Applicant’s changed attitude amounts to discontinuance — Appli-
cant expressly denied notice of discontinuance and wants the Court to decide
upon its jurisdiction — Court unable to treat Observations as having legal effect
of discontinuance — Court has power, ex officio, to put an end to a case in
interests of proper administration of justice — Not applicable in present case.

Whether Applicant’s position discloses substantive agreement on jurisdiction
resulting in absence of dispute for purposes of Article 36, paragraph 6, of
Statute — Distinction to be drawn between question of jurisdiction and right
of party to appear before the Court under the Statute — Latter not a matter
of consent — Court must reach its own conclusion.

Court cannot decline to entertain case because of a suggestion as to motives
of one of the parties or because its judgment may have influence in another case.

Whether, in light of Applicant’s contention that it was not party to the Geno-
cide Convention until March 2001, the substantive dispute with the Respondent,

in so far as jurisdiction is founded on that Convention, has disappeared — Con-
tention that Applicant has forfeited right of action and is estopped from pur-
suing the proceedings — No withdrawal of claims as to merits — Applicant
cannot be held to have renounced its rights or to be estopped from continuing the
action.

Questions of jurisdiction — Court’s “freedom to select the ground upon which
it will base its judgment” — Distinction between present proceedings and other
cases — Applicant’s right of access to Court under Article 35, paragraph 1, of
Statute, challenged — If not party to Statute at time of institution of proceed-
ings, subject to application of Article 35, paragraph 2, Applicant had no right to
appear before Court — Court must determine whether Applicant meets condi-
tions laid down in Articles 34 and 35 of Statute before examining conditions in
Article 36 of Statute.

mination by competent United Nations organs.

Different positions taken within United Nations — Positions of Security

tal proceedings in other cases including Order on provisional measures in
present case.

LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1162

FRY's sui generis position came to end with admission to United Nations on
1 November 2000 — Admission did not have effect of dating back — New devel-
opment clarified amorphous legal situation — Situation faced by Court mani-
festly different from that in 1999 — Applicant was not a Member of United
Nations, hence not party to Statute, on 29 April 1999 when it filed Application.

Court not open to Applicant, at date of filing of Application, under Article 35,
paragraph 1, of Statute.

Question whether Court open to Applicant under Article 35, paragraph 2, of
Statute — Contention by certain Respondents that Applicant may not rely on
this text — Appropriate for Court to examine question.

Scope of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Determination by Court in provisional
measures Order of April 1993 in Genocide Convention case that Article IX of
the Genocide Convention “could . . . be regarded prima facie as a special provi-
sion contained in a treaty in force” — Contentions by certain Respondents that
“treaties in force” relates only to treaties in force when Statute came into force.

Natural and ordinary meaning allows two different interpretations: treaties in
force at time when Statute came into force and treaties in force at date of insti-
tution of proceedings — Object and purpose of Article 35 is to define conditions
of access to Court: natural to reserve position in relation to treaties that might
then exist, not to allow States to obtain access to Court by conclusion between
themselves of any special treaty — First interpretation reinforced by examina-
tion of travaux préparatoires — Substantially same provision in PCIJ Statute
intended to refer to special provisions in Peace Treaties concluded after First
World War — No discussion in travaux of ICJ Statute to suggest that exten-
sion of access to Court intended.

Genocide Convention came into force after Statute — Not “treaty in force”
within meaning of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Unnecessary to decide whether
Applicant was party to Genocide Convention on 29 April 1999.

*
In view of Court’s conclusion of lack of access to Court under either
paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of Article 35 of Statute, unnecessary for Court
to consider Respondents’ other preliminary objections.

Distinction between existence of jurisdiction and compatibility of acts with


LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1163

international law — Irrespective of whether Court has jurisdiction, Parties
remain responsible for acts attributable to them that violate the rights of other
States — In present case, having no jurisdiction, Court can make no finding on
such matters.


H.E. Mr. Jodo Salgueiro, Ambassador of the Portuguese Republic to the
Kingdom of the Netherlands,

as Co-Agent;

Mr. Miguel Galväo Teles, from Miguel Galväo Teles, Jodo Soares da Silva &
Associados, member of the Portuguese Bar,

as Counsel and Advocate;

Ms Patricia Galväo Teles, Consultant to the Department of Legal Affairs,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Professor of International Law at
the Autonomous University of Lisbon,

as Counsel;

Mr. Luis de Barros, Counsellor at the Portuguese Embassy in The Hague,
Ms Filipa Marques Junior, from Miguel Galväo Teles, Jodo Soares da Silva
& Associados,

as Assistants,

THE COURT,

composed as above,
after deliberation,

delivers the following Judgment :

1. On 29 April 1999 the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(with effect from 4 February 2003, “Serbia and Montenegro”) filed in the
Registry of the Court an Application instituting proceedings against the Portu-
guese Republic (hereinafter “Portugal”) in respect of a dispute concerning acts
allegedly committed by Portugal

“by which it has violated its international obligation banning the use of
force against another State, the obligation not to intervene in the internal
affairs of another State, the obligation not to violate the sovereignty of
another State, the obligation to protect the civilian population and civilian
objects in wartime, the obligation to protect the environment, the obliga-
tion relating to free navigation on international rivers, the obligation
regarding fundamental human rights and freedoms, the obligation not to
use prohibited weapons, the obligation not to deliberately inflict condi-
tions of life calculated to cause the physical destruction of a national
group”.

The Application invoked as a basis of the Court’s jurisdiction Article 36, para-
graph 2, of the Statute of the Court, as well as Article IX of the Convention on
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the


LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1165

United Nations General Assembly on 9 December 1948 (hereinafter “the
Genocide Convention”).

2. On 29 April 1999, immediately after filing its Application, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia also submitted a request for the indication of provi-
sional measures pursuant to Article 73 of the Rules of Court.

3. On the same day, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia filed Applications
instituting proceedings and submitted requests for the indication of provisional
measures, in respect of other disputes arising out of the same facts, against the
Kingdom of Belgium, Canada, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of
Germany, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom
of Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

4, Pursuant to Article 38, paragraph 4, and Article 73, paragraph 2, of the
Rules of Court, on 29 April 1999 the Registrar transmitted signed copies of the
Application and the request to the Portuguese Government.

5. In accordance with Article 43 of the Rules of Court, the Registrar sent the
notification referred to in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court,
to all States appearing on the list of parties to the Genocide Convention held
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations as depositary; the Registrar
also sent to the Secretary-General the notifications respectively provided for in
Article 34, paragraph 3, and Article 40, paragraph 3, of the Statute of the
Court.

6. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of Yugoslav national-
ity, the Yugoslav Government exercised its right under Article 31 of the Statute
and chose Mr. Milenko Kreéa to sit as judge ad hoc in the case. By letter of
10 May 1999, the Agent of Portugal informed the Court that his Government
reserved the right to choose a judge ad hoc in the case, in accordance with
Article 31 of the Statute of the Court.

7. By Order of 2 June 1999 the Court, after hearing the Parties, rejected the
request for the indication of provisional measures submitted in the present case
by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 29 April 1999. By Orders of the same
date, the Court, after hearing the Parties, also rejected the requests for the indi-
cation of provisional measures in the nine other cases referred to in para-
graph 3 and decided to remove from the List the cases against Spain and the
United States of America.

8. By Order of 30 June 1999 the Court fixed 5 January 2000 as the time-limit
for the filing of a Memorial by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
5 July 2000 as the time-limit for the filing of a Counter-Memorial by Portugal.
On 4 January 2000, within the prescribed time-limit, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia duly filed its Memorial, dated 5 January 2000, explaining that it
had prepared a single Memorial covering this case and the seven other pending
cases concerning Legality of Use of Force.

9. By letter of 10 March 2000 the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal
informed the Court of his Government’s intention to choose Mr. José Manuel
Sérvulo Correia to sit as judge ad hoc in the case, pursuant to Article 31 of the
Statute of the Court. By letter of 24 April 2000 the Agent of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, referring to Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute,
indicated that his Government objected to the presence on the Bench of a judge
ad hoc chosen by Portugal. By letter of 5 July 2000 the Agent of Portugal
informed the Court of his Government’s views on the matter.

LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1166

10. On 5 July 2000, within the time-limit fixed for the filing of its Counter-
Memorial, Portugal, referring to Article 79, paragraph 1, of the Rules, sub-
mitted preliminary objections relating to the Court’s jurisdiction to entertain
the case and to the admissibility of the Application. Accordingly, by Order of
8 September 2000, the Vice-President of the Court, Acting President, noted that
by virtue of Article 79, paragraph 3, of the Rules, the proceedings on the merits
were suspended, and fixed 5 April 2001 as the time-limit within which the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia might present a written statement of its obser-
vations and submissions on the preliminary objections made by Portugal.

ernment no longer maintained its objection; the Agent further indicated that
his Government was in favour of a joinder of all the proceedings in accordance
with Article 47 of the Rules of Court. By letter of 18 December 2003 the Agent
of Serbia and Montenegro confirmed the views thus expressed at the meeting of
12 December 2003.

17. By letter of 23 December 2003 the Registrar informed all the Parties to
the cases concerning Legality of Use of Force of the Court’s decisions on the
issues discussed at the meeting of 12 December 2003. The Agents were informed
that the Court had decided, pursuant to Article 31, paragraph 5, of the Statute,
that, taking into account the presence upon the Bench of judges of British,
Dutch and French nationality, the judges ad hoc chosen by the respondent
States should not sit during the current phase of the procedure in these cases;
it was made clear to the Agents that this decision by the Court did not in any
way prejudice the question whether, if the Court should reject the preliminary

or in part;

obligations;

— Portugal is obliged to stop immediately the violation of the above obli-
gations vis-a-vis the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;

— Portugal is obliged to provide compensation for the damage done to
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to its citizens and juridical
persons.

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reserves the right to submit subse-
quently accurate evaluation of the damage.”

22. In the course of the written proceedings, the following submissions were
presented by the Parties:

On behalf of the Government of Serbia and Montenegro,
in the Memorial :

“The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requests the
International Court of Justice to adjudge and declare:

acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obli-
gation to respect State sovereignty;

— by activities listed above, and in particular by causing enormous envi-

ronmental damage and by using depleted uranium, the Respondent
has acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its
obligation not to deliberately inflict on a national group conditions of
life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in
part;

— by failures to prevent killing, wounding and ethnic cleansing of Serbs

and other non-Albanian groups in Kosovo and Metohija, the Respon-
dent has acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of

hija and to prevent genocide and other acts enumerated in Article III
of the Genocide Convention;

the Respondent is responsible for the violation of the above interna-
tional obligations;

the Respondent is obliged to stop immediately the violation of the

LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1171

tion, failing agreement between the Parties and to reserve, for this purpose,
the subsequent procedure in this case.”
On behalf of the Portuguese Government,
in the Preliminary Objections:
“For the reasons advanced above, Portugal requests the Court to adjudge
and declare:

1. That the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has no locus standi before the
Court.

2. That the Court lacks jurisdiction over the claims filed against Portugal
by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

3. That the claims filed against Portugal by the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are inadmissible.”

On behalf of the Government of Serbia and Montenegro,
in its written statement of 20 December 2002 containing its observations and
submissions on the preliminary objections presented by Portugal:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requests the Court to decide on its
jurisdiction considering the pleadings formulated in these Written Obser-
vations.”

23. At the oral proceedings, the following submissions were presented by the
Parties:
On behalf of the Portuguese Government,
at the hearing of 22 April 2004:
“May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that:

(i) the Court is not called upon to give a decision on the claims of Serbia
and Montenegro.

Alternatively,
(ii) the Court lacks jurisdiction, either
(a) under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute;
(b) under Article IX of the Genocide Convention;
and
The claims are inadmissible.”

On behalf of the Government of Serbia and Montenegro,
at the hearing of 23 April 2004:

“For the reasons given in its pleadings, and in particular in its Written
Observations, subsequent correspondence with the Court, and at the oral
hearing, Serbia and Montenegro requests the Court:

— to adjudge and declare on its jurisdiction ratione personae in the
present cases; and

— to dismiss the remaining preliminary objections of the respondent
States, and to order proceedings on the merits if it finds it has jurisdic-
tion ratione personae.”


LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1172

24. The official title of the Applicant in these proceedings has changed


and that therefore

“the declarations made by the Parties under Article 36, paragraph 2,
of the Statute do not constitute a basis on which the jurisdiction of
the Court could prima facie be founded in this case” (ibid., para. 29).

With regard to the question of jurisdiction under the Genocide Conven-
tion, the Court, after examining the acts imputed by Serbia and Mon-
tenegro to the Respondent, found that it was not in a position to con-
clude, at that stage of the proceedings, that those acts were capable of
coming within the provisions of the Genocide Convention, and therefore
that “Article IX of the Convention, invoked by Yugoslavia, cannot
accordingly constitute a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court
could prima facie be founded in this case” (ibid., p. 670, para. 40).

48. In the course of the proceedings on this request, however, the
Respondent raised the issue of whether the Applicant was a party to the
Statute of the Court. Referring, inter alia, to United Nations Security
Council resolutions 777 (1992) of 19 September 1992 and 821 (1993) of


LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 1181

28 April 1993 and to United Nations General Assembly resolutions 47/1
of 22 September 1992 and 48/88 of 20 December 1993, Portugal con-
tended that ““the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is not a United Nations
