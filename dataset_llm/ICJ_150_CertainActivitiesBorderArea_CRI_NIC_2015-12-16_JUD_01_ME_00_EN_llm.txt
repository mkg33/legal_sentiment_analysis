                       Geographical and historical context and origin of the disputes.
                       The San Juan River, Lower San Juan and Colorado River — Isla Calero and
                    Isla Portillos — Harbor Head Lagoon — Wetlands of international importance —
                    1858 Treaty of Limits — Cleveland Award — Alexander Awards — Dredging of
                    the San Juan by Nicaragua — Activities of Nicaragua in the northern part of
                    Isla Portillos : dredging of a channel (caño) and establishment of a military pres‑
                    ence — Construction of Route 1856 Juan Rafael Mora Porras (the road) by
                    Costa Rica.


                       certain activities and construction of a road (judgment)                668

                 insufficient to prove caño existed prior to dredging in 2010 — Affidavits of Nica‑
                 raguan State officials also insufficient — Significance of map evidence and effec-
                 tivités limited — Effectivités cannot affect title to sovereignty resulting from
                 1858 Treaty and Cleveland and Alexander Awards — Existence of caño prior to
                 2010 contradicted by other evidence — Nicaragua’s claim would prevent
                 Costa Rica from enjoying territorial sovereignty over the right bank of the San
                 Juan as far as its mouth — Right bank of the caño not part of the boundary —
                 Sovereignty over disputed territory belongs to Costa Rica.

                    Alleged breaches of Costa Rica’s sovereignty — Uncontested that Nicaragua
                 excavated three caños and established a military presence in disputed territory —
                 Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty breached — Obligation to make reparation —
                 No violation of Article IX of 1858 Treaty — No need to consider possible violation
                 of prohibition of threat or use of force — No need to consider whether conduct of
                 Nicaragua constitutes a military occupation.

                    Procedural obligations — Obligation to conduct environmental impact assess‑
                 ment concerning activities that risk causing significant transboundary harm —
                 Content of environmental impact assessment depends on specific circumstances —
                 If assessment confirms risk of significant transboundary harm, State planning the
                 activity is required, in conformity with due diligence obligation, to notify and
                 consult with potentially affected State, where necessary to determine appropriate
                 measures to prevent or mitigate risk — Nicaragua’s dredging programme did not
                 give rise to risk of significant transboundary harm — Nicaragua not required to
                 carry out transboundary environmental impact assessment — No obligation under
                 general international law to notify and consult since no risk of significant trans‑
                 boundary harm — No conventional obligation to notify and consult in present
                 case — Court concludes that no procedural obligations breached by Nicaragua.



                    Substantive obligations — Specific obligations concerning San Juan River in
                 1858 Treaty as interpreted by Cleveland Award — Customary law obligation to
                 exercise due diligence to avoid causing significant transboundary harm — No need
                 to discuss relationship between these obligations because no harm established —
                 No proof that dredging of Lower San Juan harmed Costa Rican wetland — Not
                 shown that dredging programme caused significant reduction in flow of Colorado
                 River — Any diversion of water due to dredging did not seriously impair naviga‑
                 tion on Colorado River or otherwise cause harm to Costa Rica — Court concludes
                 that no substantive obligations breached by Nicaragua.

                   Compliance with provisional measures — Nicaragua breached its obligations
                 under Order of 8 March 2011 by excavating two caños and establishing a military
                 presence in disputed territory in 2013 — Breach of obligations under Court’s
                 Order of 22 November 2013 not established.

                    Rights of navigation — Claim is admissible — Article VI of the 1858 Treaty —
                 Court’s Judgment in Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights — No
                 need for the Court to interpret Nicaraguan Decree No. 079‑2009 — Five instances
                 of violations of navigational rights raised by Costa Rica — Two of the five
                 instances examined — Court concludes Nicaragua breached Costa Rica’s naviga‑
                 tional rights pursuant to the 1858 Treaty — Not necessary for Court to consider
                 the other incidents invoked by Costa Rica.

                    Reparation — Requests to order repeal of Decree No. 079‑2009 and cessation
                 of dredging activities cannot be granted — Declaration of breach provides ade‑
                 quate satisfaction for non‑material injury suffered — No need for guarantees of
                 non-repetition — Costa Rica entitled to compensation for material damage —
                 Parties should engage in negotiation on amount of compensation — Failing agree‑
                 ment within 12 months, Court will determine amount at request of one of the Par‑
                 ties — Award of costs under Article 64 of the Statute not appropriate.

                    Procedural obligations.
                    Alleged breach of obligation to carry out environmental impact assessment —
                 Due diligence obligation requires State to ascertain whether a proposed activity
                 entails risk of significant transboundary harm — Environmental impact assess‑
                 ment required when risk is present — No evidence that Costa Rica determined
                 whether environmental impact assessment was necessary prior to constructing the
                 road — Large scale of road project — Proximity to San Juan River on Nicara‑
                 guan territory — Risk of erosion due to deforestation — Possibility of natural
                 disasters in area — Presence of two wetlands of international importance in
                 area — Construction of road carried a risk of significant transboundary harm —
                 No emergency justifying immediate construction of road — Court need not decide
                 whether there is, in international law, an emergency exemption from obligation to
                 carry out environmental impact assessment — Costa Rica under obligation to con‑
                 duct environmental impact assessment — Obligation requires ex ante evaluation of
                 risk of significant transboundary harm — Environmental Diagnostic Assessment
                 and other studies by Costa Rica were post hoc assessments — Costa Rica has not
                 complied with obligation to carry out environmental impact assessment.

                    Alleged breach of Article 14 of Convention on Biological Diversity — No viola‑
                 tion established.
                    Alleged breach of obligation to notify and consult — General international law
                 duty to notify and consult does not call for examination because Costa Rica has
                 not carried out environmental impact assessment — 1858 Treaty did not impose
                 obligation on Costa Rica to notify Nicaragua of construction of road — No proce‑
                 dural obligations arose under Ramsar Convention.

                    Alleged breach of obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent causing signifi‑
                 cant transboundary harm — Modelling and estimates by experts suggest sediment
                 due to construction of road amounts to at most 2 per cent of San Juan River’s total
                 load — Actual measurements provided to Court do not indicate that road signifi‑
                 cantly impacted sediment levels in river — Increase in sediment levels as a result of
                 construction of road did not in and of itself cause significant transboundary
                 harm — No significant harm to river’s morphology, to navigation or to Nicara‑
                 gua’s dredging programme established — No proof of significant harm to river’s
                 ecosystem or water quality — Arguments concerning other alleged harm fail.



                     Alleged breaches of treaty obligations — No violation established.

                    Claim concerning violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty — No viola‑
                 tion established.

                     Reparation — Declaration of wrongful conduct in respect of obligation to
                 c­onduct environmental impact assessment is the appropriate measure of satis­
                  faction — No grounds to order Costa Rica to cease continuing wrongful acts —
                 Restitution and compensation not appropriate remedies in absence of significant
                 harm — No need to appoint expert or committee to evaluate harm — Nicaragua’s
                 request to order Costa Rica not to undertake future development without an envi‑
                 ronmental impact assessment dismissed.
