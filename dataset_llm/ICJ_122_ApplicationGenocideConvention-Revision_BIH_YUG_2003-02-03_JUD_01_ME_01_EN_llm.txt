1 It 1s rare that an application for revision of a judgment comes
before the Court, hence the jurisprudence in this area 1s rather scant See,
however, Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of
24 February 1982 in the Case concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (Tunisia v Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Judg-
ment, I CJ Reports 1985 It 1s therefore important that whilst endeav-
ourmg to uphold the mtegrity of its decisions, the Court should clarify
the meaning of Article 61 of the Statute, governing the request for revi-
sion, as well as its jurisprudence in this area on those few occasions when
the opportunity arises

2 The revision procedure stipulated in Article 61 raises the question as
to what the Court ought to do in the light of fresh evidence or fresh argu-
ments which have been discovered or have emerged since 1ts decision in
the specific case In other words, the Court is called upon to reconsider a
matter which 1t has already decided in the light of fresh facts or argu-
ments, 1f these prove of such importance or of such decisive nature that,
had the Court known of them, it would have reached a different decision
or a different conclusion Revision presupposes that the fact must have
existed prior to the Judgment, even though discovered subsequently, and
that the lack of knowledge was not due to neghgence The revision pro-
cedure 1s thus essentially about newly discovered facts or arguments and
not a legal challenge, as such, to the conclusion reached carlier by the
Court based on the facts as then known, although the outcome of the
challenge may have an effect on the Judgment

3 In ts 1996 Judgment, the Court found that 1t had jurisdiction in the
case of the Application presented by Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis



of Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide (the “Genocide Convention”) The Court’s finding was
based on the fact that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) had on
22 April 1992 formally declared that it remained bound by those treaties to
which the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was
party The Court also found that the FRY had not denied that it was a
party to the Genocide Convention Thus, the Court reached the conclusion
that the FRY was a party to that Convention on 20 March 1993, the date
on which Bosnia and Herzegovina filed its Apphcation The Court simi-
larly found that Bosnia and Herzegovina was also a party to the Genocide
Convention by virtue of the deposit of a notice of succession to the Con-
vention with the United Nations Secretary-General on 29 December 1992

8 According to the jurisprudence, and as stated above, the discovery
of new facts 1s a strict condition on the availability of revision This con-
dition 1s also fundamental to the decision on the Application, whether the
admission of the FRY to membership of the United Nations which took
place on 1 November 2000 1s a newly discovered fact within the meaning
of Article 61 of the Statute, which fact must have existed, but been
unknown, at the time of the Judgment

9 It 1s against this background that I have difficulty with some con-
clusions reached in the Judgment One such difficulty is that the Court,
without defining what in its opimon will be considered a “new” fact
within the meaning of Article 61, stated that if the fact occurred several
years after a judgment, this 1s not a new fact within the meaning of Ar-
ticle 61, irrespective of its legal consequences Although this as a position
of law 1s correct as far as 1t goes, the issue the Court has to deterrmne
involves the question as to whether or not Yugoslavia was a Member of
the United Nations before 1 November 2000 The Court itself had earher
acknowledged 1n 1ts Judgment in 1996, that the FRY’s status regarding
United Nations membership was not free from “legal difficulties”
Accordingly, to dismiss the FRY’s admission to membership of the
United Nations in November 2000 and 1ts legal consequences as simply a
fact occurring several years after the Judgment 1s a distortion and too
superficial That General Assembly resolution 55/12 of 1 November 2000
led to the FRY’s membership of the United Nations 1s not only a fact or
an event but this fact or event had certain consequences It 1s to be
recalled that the Court relied for the basis of its Judgment m 1996 on the
FRY’s declaration of 22 April 1992 that 1t remained bound by those trea-
ties to which the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had
been a party, and the Court assumed for this purpose that the FRY was
a Member of the United Nations Unless such assumption was made, the
FRY’s declaration alone should not and could not legally have been suf-
ficient to serve as a basis for recognition of the FRY as a party to the
Genocide Convention — the sole basis on which the Court founded its



jurisdiction Accordingly, the FRY’s admission to membership of the
United Nations on 1 November 2000 suggests that it was not a Member
of the United Nations in 1996 and thus was not a party to the Genocide
Convention, therefore, the basis of the Court’s jurisdiction no longer
exists Unfortunately, the Court chose not to address these critical issues,
which were raised in the Application and in the hearings, but rather
stated that the consequences which the FRY sought to draw from the
facts which occurred in 2000, even if established, “cannot be regarded as
facts within the meaning of Article 61” (Judgment, para 69) Far from

10 Granted that the 1ssues raised by this case are not easy of solution,
but I fear that the answers provided beg the question and cannot with-
stand scrutiny In this regard the appraisal of Article 61 and its applica-
tion to this case leave much to be desired, hence my doubts and mis-
givings as far as the Judgment 1s concerned

11 In my view, when an application for revision 1s submitted under
Article 61 and where fresh facts have emerged and are of such impor-
tance as to warrant revising the earlier decision or conclusion, the Court
should be willing to carry out such a procedure. Such an application 1s
not to be regarded as impugning the Court’s earlier legal decision as
such, as that decision was based on the facts as then known I am of the
view that the admission of the FRY to membership of the United
Nations in November 2000 does have legal implications for the Judgment
reached by the Court on this matter in July 1996

12 In my opmion, the Court’s jurisdiction could have been founded
on more legally secure grounds
