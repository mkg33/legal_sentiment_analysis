that the Decree involves a discrimination in favour of France
which contravenes the treaty rights of the United States.

By a Dahir of September gth, 1939, His Shercefian Majesty decided
as follows :

“Article 1.—It is prohibited to import into the French Zone of
the Shercetian Empire, whatever may be the customs regulations
in force, goods other than gold in any form.

Article 2.—The Director General of Communications may, how-
ever, waive this prohibition on entry as regards combustible solid
mineral matter and petroleum products, and the Director of Econo-
mic Affairs may do likewise as regards any other products.

Article 3.—It is left to the decision of the Resident General to
determine the measures whereby the provisions herein contained
shall be put into effect.”

A Residential Decree of the same date laid down the terms of
application of the Dahir, including provisions relating to requests
for a waiver of the prohibition of imports. Article 4 provided :

“Goods of French or Algerian origin shipped from France or
Algeria, shall for the time being be admitted without any special
formalities.”

Further regulations were prescribed by a Residential Decree of
September 10th, 1939, subjecting imports without official allocation

I0


of currency to special authorization. Article 7 provided in its first
paragraph :
“Commercial arrangements with France, Algeria, French Colonies,

African territories under French Mandate, and Tunisia, are not
subject to the provisions herein contained.”

By a Residential Decree of March 11th, 1948, a new Article 5
was added to the Decree of September gth, 1939:

“Article 5 —Save for such exceptions as may be specified by the
appropriate heads of departments, the prohibition on entry shall
hereafter be generally waived as regards goods imported from any
origin or source, when import does not entail any financial settle-
ment between the French zone of the Shereefian Empire, France,
or any territory of the French Union on the one part and foreign
territory on the other part.”

Finally, this new Article 5 was revoked by the Decree of Decem-
ber 30th, 1948, which is the subject-matter of the present dispute.
After having referred to the Dahir of September gth, 1939, and to
the Decrees of that date and of March 11th, 1948, the Resident
General of the French Republic decreed :

“Article 1.—The provisions of Article 5 of the aforesaid Residen-
tial Decree of September gth, 1939, will cease to apply as from
January 1st, 1949, save for the exception set out in Article 2 hereof.

Article 2.—Goods which are proved to have been shipped
directly to the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire before
January 15th, 1949, shall still fall within the provisions of Article 5
of the aforesaid Residential Decree of September gth, 1939.

The effect of this Decree was to restore the import regulations
introduced in September 193g. Imports without official allocation
of currency were again subjected to a system of licensing control.
But these import regulations did not apply to France or other parts
of the French Union. From France and other parts of the French
Union imports into the French zone of Morocco were free. The
Decree of December 30th, 1948, involved consequently a discrimi-
nation in favour of France, and the Government of the United
States contends that this discrimination contravenes its treaty
rights.

It is common ground between the Parties that the characteristic
of the status of Morocco, as resulting from the General Act of
Algeciras of April 7th, 1906, is respect for the three principles stated
in the Preamble of the Act, namely : “the sovereignty and inde-
pendence of His Majesty the Sultan, the integrity of his domains,
and economic liberty without any inequality”. The last-mentioned
principle of economic liberty without any inequality must, in its



application to Morocco, be considered against the background of
the treaty provisions relating to trade and equality of treatment in
economic matters existing at that time.

By the Treaty of Commerce with Great Britain of December gth,
1856, as well as by Treaties with Spain of November zoth, 1861,
and with Germany of June 1st, 1890, the Sultan of Morocco gua-
ranteed certain rights in matters of trade, including imports into
Morocco. These States, together with a number of other States,
including the United States, were guaranteed equality of treatment
by virtue of most-favoured-nation clauses in their treaties with
Morocco. On the eve of the Algeciras Conference the three principles
mentioned above, including the principle of “economic liberty with-
out any inequality”, were expressly accepted by France and Ger-
many in an exchange of letters of July 8th, 1905, concerning their
attitude with regard to Morocco. This principle, in its application to
Morocco, was thus already well established, when it was reaffirmed
by that Conference and inserted in the Preamble of the Act of 1906.
Considered in the light of these circumstances, it seems clear that
the principle was intended to be of a binding character and not
merely an empty phrase. This was confirmed by Article 105, where
the principle was expressly applied in relation to the public services
in Morocco. It was also confirmed by declarations made at the
Conference by the representative of Spain, who referred to “equa-
lity of treatment in commercial matters’, as well as by the repre-
sentative of France.

The establishment of the French Protectorate over Morocco by
the Treaty of March 3oth, 1912, between France and Morocco, did
not involve any modification in this respect. In the Convention
between France and Germany of November 4th, 1911, concerning
the establishment of this Protectorate, the Government of Germany
made in Article 1 the reservation that ‘the action of France should
secure in Morocco economic equality between the nations”. On the
other hand, the Government of France declared in Article 4 that it
would use its good offices with the Moroccan Government “in order
to prevent any differential treatment of the subjects of the various
Powers.”

The other States on behalf of which the Act of Algeciras was
signed, with the exception of the United States, adhered later to
the Franco-German Convention of 1g1x, thereby again accepting
the principle of equality of treatment in economic matters in
Morocco. France endeavoured to obtain also the adherence of the
United States, and in a Note of November 3rd, 1911, from the
French Ambassador in Washington to the United States Secretary
of State, reference was made to the Franco-German Convention, It
was declared that France would use her good offices with the Moroc-
can Government in order to prevent any differential treatment of
the subjects of the Powers. In another Note from the French
Ambassador to the Secretary of State, dated November 14th, 1918,



it was declared that the benefit of commercial equality in Morocco
results, not only from the most-favoured-nation clause, but also
from the clause of economic equality which is inserted in the Act of
Algeciras and reproduced in the Franco-German Convention of 1911.

These various facts show that commercial or economic equality
in Morocco was assured to the United States, not only by Morocco,
but also by France as the protecting State. It may be asked whether
France, in spite of her position as the protector of Morocco, is
herself subject to this principle of equality and can not enjoy com-
mercial or economic privileges which are not equally enjoyed by the
United States.

It is not disputed by the French Government that Morocco, even
under the Protectorate, has retained its personality as a State in
international law. The rights of France in Morocco are defined by
the Protectorate Treaty of 1912. In economic matters France is
accorded no privileged position in Morocco. Such a privileged posi-
tion would not be compatible with the principle of economic liberty
without any inequality, on which the Act of Algeciras is based. This
was confirmed by the above-mentioned Note from the French
Ambassador in Washington of November 14th, 1918, where it is
stated that, by virtue of the clause of economic equality inserted in
the Act of Algeciras, other States have preserved their right to
enjoy such equality, “méme vis-à-vis de la Puissance protectrice”,
and that the United States can, therefore, not only recognize French
courts in Morocco, but also give up, in the French Zone, the enjoy-
ment of all privileges following from capitulations, without thereby
losing this advantage.

It follows from the above-mentioned considerations that the pro-
visions of the Decree of December 30th, 1948, contravene the rights
which the United States has acquired under the Act of Algeciras,
because they discriminate between imports from France and other
parts of the French Union, on the one hand, and imports from the
United States on the other. France was exempted from control of
imports without allocation of currency, while the United States was
subjected to such control. This differential treatment was not com-
patible with the Act of Algeciras, by virtue of which the United
States can claim to be treated as favourably as France, as far as
economic matters in Morocco are concerned.

This conclusion can also be derived from the Treaty between the
United States and Morocco of September 16th, 1836, Article 24,
where it is “declared that whatever indulgence, in trade or other-
wise, shall be granted to any of the Christian Powers, the citizens
of the United States shall be equally entitled to them”. Having
regard to the conclusion already arrived at on the basis of the Act
of Algeciras, the Court will limit itself to stating as its opinion that
the United States, by virtue of this most-favoured-nation clause,



has the right to object to any discrimination in favour of France,
in the matter of imports into the French Zone of Morocco.

The Government of France has submitted various contentions
purporting to demonstrate the legality of exchange control. The
Court does not consider it necessary to pronounce upon these conten-
tions. Even assuming the legality of exchange control, the fact
nevertheless remains that the measures applied by virtue of the
Decree of December 30th, 1948, have involved a discrimination in
favour of imports from France and other parts of the French Union.
This discrimination can not be justified by considerations relating
to exchange control.

For these reasons the Court has arrived at the conclusion that
the French Submission relating to the Decree of December 30th,
1948, must be rejected. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider
whether this Submission might be rejected also for other reasons
invoked by the Government of the United States. In these circum-
stances, the Court is not called upon to consider and decide the
general question of the extent of the control over importation that
may be exercised by the Moroccan authorities.

The first point raised by the Submissions relates to the scope of
the jurisdictional clauses of the Treaty of 1836, which read as follows:

“Article 20.—If any of the citizens of the United States, or any
persons under their protection, shall have any dispute with each



other, the Consul shall decide between the parties ; and whenever
the Consul shall require any aid, or assistance from our government,
to enforce his decisions, it shall be immediately granted to him.

Article 21.—Tf a citizen of the United States should kill or wound
a Moor, or, on the contrary, if a Moor shall kill or wound a citizen
of the United States, the law of the country shall take place, and
equal justice shall be rendered, the Consul assisting at the trial ;
and if any delinquent shall make his escape, the Consul shall not
be answerable for him in any manner whatever.”

It is argued that Article 20 should be construed as giving consular
jurisdiction over all disputes, civil and criminal, between United
States citizens and protégés. France, on the other hand, contends
that the word ‘dispute’ is limited to civil cases. It has been argued
that this word in its ordinary and natural sense would be confined
to civil disputes, and that crimes are offences against the State and
not disputes between private individuals.

The Treaty of 1836 replaced an earlier treaty between the United
States and Morocco which was concluded in 1787. The two treaties
were substantially identical in terms and Articles 20 and 21 are the
same in both. Accordingly, in construing the provisions of Article 20
—and, in particular, the expression “shall have any dispute with
each other’’—it is necessary to take into account the meaning of
the word ‘dispute’ at the times when the two treaties were con-
cluded. For this purpose it is possible to look at the way in which the
word ‘‘dispute’’ or its French counterpart was used in the different
treaties concluded by Morocco : e.g., with France in 1631 and 1682,
with Great Britain in 1721, 1750, 1751, 1760 and 1801. It is clear
that in these instances the word was used to cover both civil and
criminal disputes.

It is also necessary to take into account that, at the times of
these two treaties, the clear-cut distinction between civil and
criminal matters had not yet been developed in Morocco.

Accordingly, it is necessary to construe the word “‘dispute”, as
used in Article 20, as referring both to civil disputes and to criminal
disputes, in so far as they relate to breaches of the criminal law
committed by a United States citizen or protégé upon another
United States citizen or protégé.

* *

The second point arises out of the United States Submission that
consular jurisdiction was acquired ‘“in all cases in which an American
citizen or protégé was defendant through the effect of the most-
favoured-nation clause and through custom and usage” and that
such jurisdiction was not affected by the surrender by Great Britain
in 1937 of its rights of jurisdiction in the French Zone and has never
been renounced expressly or impliedly by the United States.



It is necessary to give special attention to the most-favoured-
nation clauses of the United States Treaty of 1836. There were two
grants of most-favoured-nation treatment.

Article 14 provides :

“The commerce with the United States shall be on the same
footing as is the commerce with Spain, or as that with the most
favored nation for the time being ; and their citizens shall be res-
pected and esteemed, and have full liberty to pass and repass our
country and seaports whenever they please, without interruption.”

Article 24 deals with the contingencies of war, but it contains a
final sentence :

“.... and it is further declared, that whatever indulgence, in
trade or otherwise, shall be granted to any of the Christian Powers,
the citizens of the United States shall be equally entitled to them.”

These articles entitle the United States to invoke the provisions
of other treaties relating to the capitulatory regime.

The most extensive privileges in the matter of consular juris-
diction granted by Morocco were those which were contained in the
General Treaty with Great Britain of 1856 and in the Treaty of
Commerce and Navigation with Spain of 1861. Under the provisions
of Article IX of the British Treaty, there was a grant of consular
jurisdiction in all cases, civil and criminal, when British nationals
were defendants. Similarly, in Articles IX, X and XI of the Spanish
Treaty of 1861, civil and criminal jurisdiction was established for
cases in which Spanish nationals were defendants.

Accordingly, the United States acquired by virtue of the most-
favoured-nation clauses, civil and criminal consular jurisdiction in
all cases in which United States nationals were defendants.

The controversy between the Parties with regard to consular

Spanish Zone. This was accomplished by a bilateral Declaration
between France and Spain of November 17th of the same year.

The United States contends that, as both the Convention of 1912
and the Declarations of 1914 were agreements between France and
Spain, and as Morocco was not named as a party to either agree-
ment, the rights of Spain under the earlier provision still exist de
jure, notwithstanding that there may be a de facto situation which
temporarily prevents their exercise.

Even if this contention is accepted, the position is one in which
Spain has been unable to insist on the right to exercise consular
jurisdiction in the French Zone since 1914. The rights which the
United States would be entitled to invoke by virtue of the most-
favoured-nation clauses would therefore not include the right to
exercise consular jurisdiction in the year 1950. They would be
limited to the contingent right of re-establishing consular jurisdic-
tion at some later date in the event of France and Spain abrogating
the agreements made by the Convention of 1912 and the Declara-
tions of 1914.

France contends that these agreements were concluded pursuant
to the power which Morocco conferred on France by the provisions
of the Treaty of Fez of 1grz. The general terms of Articles V and VI
were broad enough to give to France the conduct of the international
relations of Morocco, including the exercise of the treaty-making
power. The Convention and the Declarations must therefore be
regarded as agreements made by a protecting Power, within the
scope of its authority, touching the affairs of and intended to bind
the protected State, as is made clear by the third paragraph of
Article I of the Treaty of Fez of 1912 which provided that : “The
Government of the Republic will come to an understanding with
the Spanish Government regarding the interests which the latter
Government has in virtue of its geographical position and terri-
torial possessions on the Moroccan coast.” In these circumstances,
it is necessary to hold that these agreements bound and enured to



the benefit of Morocco and that the Spanish rights as regards con-
sular jurisdiction came to an end de jure as well as de facto.

It is necessary to deal with another aspect of this question which
arises out of the wording of the Declaration made by France and
Spain on March 7th, 1914. This Declaration contained the follow-
ing provisions :

“Taking into consideration the guarantees of judicial equality
offered to foreigners by the French Tribunals of the Protectorate,
His Catholic Majesty's Government renounces claiming for its
consuls, its subjects, and its establishments in the French Zone

Zone of the Sherecfian Empire, all the rights and privileges arising
out of the regime of the Capitulations.”

It will be observed that both Declarations use the words “renonce
à réclamer” (renounces claiming) and the question has arisen whether
these words were intended as a surrender or renunciation of all the
rights and privileges arising out of the capitulatory regime, or
whether they must be considered as temporary undertakings not
to claim those rights or privileges so long as the guarantees for
judicial equality are maintained in the French Zone by the tribunals
of the Protectorate and so long as the corresponding guarantees are
maintained in the Spanish Zone,

The question is academic rather than practical. Even if the words
in question should be construed as meaning a temporary under-
taking not to claim the rights and privileges, the fact remains that
Spain, in 1950, as a result of these undertakings was not entitled to
exercise consular jurisdiction in the French Zone. It follows that
the United States would be equally not entitled to exercise such
jurisdiction in the French Zone in the year 1950.



Nevertheless, it is necessary for the Court to examine these
Declarations in order to determine what the parties had in mind
when they used the words in question.

The parties in both Declarations used the expression ‘taking into
consideration the guarantees of judicial equality ....”. These are
words which, if given their ordinary and natural meaning, state the
consideration which led to the making of the surrender, but they
are not words which would normally be used if it was intended to
make a conditional surrender.

The Court is of opinion that the words “renonce à réclamer” must
be regarded as an out-and-out renunciation of the capitulatory
rights and privileges. This view is confirmed by taking into account
the declarations and other arrangements made by France with other
interested Powers designed to bring about the surrender of their
jurisdictional and other extraterritorial rights in the French Zone.

The two Declarations made by France and Spain in 1914 show
that they both regarded the expression ‘renonce à réclamer” as
equivalent to a renunciation of the rights in question. In the Declar-
ation of March 7th, 1914, the French Government bound itself “to
renounce equally the rights and privileges ....”. In the later Declar-
ation of November 17th, 1914, France gave effect to this obligation
by using the expression ‘“‘renonce à réclamer’. It is clear, therefore,
that both France and Spain regarded this expression as proper for
bringing about a complete surrender or renunciation of the rights
and privileges in question.

On July 31st, 1916, the French Ambassador at Washington sent
to the Secretary of State of the United States “the text of the
Declaration signed, with reference to the abrogation of capitula-
tions in the French Zone of Morocco, by all the Powers signatory
of the Algeciras Conference and by the South-American Republics”.
In the text, thus transmitted, the expression used in English was
“relinquishes its claim to all the rights and privileges growing out
of the Capitulation regime ...."”". It is thus clear that at that date,
long before the present dispute had arisen, France regarded the
expression ‘relinquishes its claim” (or, in other words, “renonce à
réclamer’) as bringing about the abrogation of the privileges in
question.

The Declaration made by France and Spain of March 7th, 1914,
was one of a series of agreements negotiated by France with more
than twenty foreign States “for the surrender of their jurisdictional
and other extraterritorial rights so far as concerned the French
Zone of Morocco”. At least seventeen of these agreements used the
expression ‘‘renonce à réclamer” as a means of bringing about a
complete abrogation of all rights and privileges arising out of the
regime of Capitulations. They are referred to in the Counter-
Memorial in the following words : “for the surrender of their juris-



dictional and other extraterritorial rights”, and again, ‘for the
renunciation of extraterritorial rights”. Further, all of the States
which had signed these agreements abandoned forthwith the exer-
cise of consular jurisdiction or other capitulatory rights or privi-
leges in the French Zone.

In these circumstances, it is necessary to conclude that the
Spanish Declaration of March 7th, 1914, brought about the surrender
or renunciation of all Spanish jurisdictional or other extraterritorial
rights in the French Zone, and an abrogation of those provisions of
the Spanish Treaty of 1861 which concern “the rights and privileges
arising out of the regime of Capitulations”.

The Court, therefore, can not accept the contention that the
United States is entitled, by virtue of the most-favoured-nation
clauses, to invoke in respect of the French Zone those provisions
of the Spanish Treaty of 1861 which concern consular jurisdiction.

sk

The fourth contention of the United States is that the extensive
consular jurisdiction as it existed in Morocco in the year 1880 was
recognized and confirmed by the provisions of the Madrid Conven-
tion, and that the United States, as a party to that Convention,
thereby acquired an autonomous right to the exercise of such
jurisdiction, independently of the operation of the most-favoured-
nation clauses.

There can be no doubt that the exercise of consular jurisdiction
in Morocco in the year 1880 was general, or that the Convention
presupposed the existence of such jurisdiction. It dealt with the
special position of protégés and contained provisions for the exercise
of jurisdiction with regard to them.

On the other hand, it is equally clear that there were no provi-
sions of the Convention which expressly brought about a confirm-
ation of the then existing system of consular jurisdiction, or its
establishment as an independent and autonomous right.

The purposes and objects of this Convention were stated in its
Preamble in the following words : “the necessity of establishing, on
fixed and uniform bases, the exercise of the right of protection in
Morocco and of settling certain questions connected therewith....”.
In these circumstances, the Court can not adopt a construction by
implication of the provisions of the Madrid Convention which would
go beyond the scope of its declared purposes and objects. Further,
this contention would involve radical changes and additions
to the provisions of the Convention. The Court, in its Opinion—
Interpretation of Peace Treaties (Second Phase) (I.C.J. Reports
1950, p. 220) —stated : “It is the duty of the Court to interpret
the Treaties, not to revise them.”


The fifth contention of the United States is that the consular
jurisdiction in Morocco was recognized and confirmed by various
provisions of the Act of Algeciras, and that the United States
acquired an autonomous right to exercise such jurisdiction inde-
pendently of the operation of the most-favoured-nation clauses.

In 1906 the twelve Powers at Algeciras all exercised capitulatory
rights and privileges to the extent that they were prescribed either
by the General Treaty with Great Britain of 1856 or by the Spanish
Treaty of 1861. They did so by virtue of direct treaty grant, as in
the case of Great Britain or Spain ; or by virtue of most-favoured-
nation clauses, as in the case of the United States; or without
treaty rights, but with the consent or acquiescence of Morocco, as
in the case of certain other States. Accordingly, the Act of Algeciras
pre-supposed the existence of the regime of Capitulations, including
the rights of consular jurisdiction, and many of its provisions
assigned particular functions to the then existing consular tribunals.
Reference has been made in the course of the argument to Arti-
cles 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, 45, 59, 80, 81, 87, 91, 101, 102 and 119. For
example, Chapter V, which deals with ‘the customs of the Empire
and the repression of fraud and smuggling”, contains Article 102,
which provides :

“Every confiscation, fine or penalty must be imposed on foreigners
by consular jurisdiction, and on Moorish subjects by Shereefian
jurisdiction.”

In the conditions which existed at the time, this Article made it
necessary for the prosecution of nationals of the twelve Powers for
fraud and smuggling to be dealt with in the consular courts.

Since 1937, the position has been one in which eleven of the
Powers have abandoned their capitulatory privileges, and their
consular jurisdiction has ceased to exist. Accordingly, Morocco has
been able to make laws and to provide for the trial and punishment
of offenders who are nationals of these eleven countries. The posi-
tion of the United States is different, and must now be examined.

Unlike the Madrid Convention, the Act of Algeciras was general
in its scope and was not confined to a limited problem such as that
of protection. On the other hand, the interpretation of the provisions
of the Act must take into account its purposes, which are set forth
in the Preamble in the following words :

“Inspired by the interest attaching itself to the reign of order,
peace, and prosperity in Morocco, and recognizing that the attain-
ment thereof can only be effected by means of the introduction of
reforms based upon the triple principle of the sovereignty and inde-
pendence of His Majesty the Sultan, the integrity of his domains,
and economic liberty without any inequality...”



Neither the Articles to which reference has been made above nor
any other provisions of the Act of Algeciras purport to establish
consular jurisdiction or to confirm the rights or privileges of the
regime of Capitulations which were then in existence. The question,
therefore, is whether the establishment or confirmation of such
jurisdiction or privileges can be based upon the implied intentions
of the parties to the Act as indicated by its provisions.

An interpretation, by implication from the provisions of the Act,
establishing or confirming consular jurisdiction would involve a
transformation of the then existing treaty rights of most of the
twelve Powers into new and autonomous rights based upon the Act.
It would change treaty rights of the Powers, some of them termin-
able at short notice, e.g., those of the United States which were
terminable by twelve months’ notice, into rights enjoyable for an
unlimited period by the Powers and incapable of being terminated
or modified by Morocco. Neither the preparatory work nor the
Preamble gives the least indication of any such intention. The Court
finds itself unable to imply so fundamental a change in the character
of the then existing treaty rights as would be involved in the
acceptance of this contention.

There is, however, another aspect of this problem arising out of
the particular Articles to which reference has been made above.
These are the Articles which include provisions necessarily involving
the exercise of consular jurisdiction. In this case, there is a clear
indication of the intention of the parties to the effect that certain
matters are to be dealt with by the consular tribunals and to this
extent it is possible to interpret the provisions of the Act as estab-
lishing or confirming the exercise of consular jurisdiction for these
limited purposes. The maintenance of consular jurisdiction in so
far as it may be necessary to give effect to these specific provisions
can, therefore, be justified as based upon the necessary intendment
of the provisions of the Act.

This result is confirmed by the provisions of Articles 10 and 16
of the Convention between Great Britain and France of July zoth,
1937. These Articles refer to the jurisdictional privileges “accorded
on the basis of existing treaties” or “enjoyed by the United States
of America under treaties at present in force”. They pre-suppose,
therefore, that the jurisdictional privileges of the United States,
even after the surrender of British capitulatory rights, would not
be limited to the jurisdiction provided by Articles 20 and 21 of the
Treaty with Morocco of 1836. This view is also supported by the
provisions of Article 4 of the Protocol of Signature to this Conven-
tion. This Article provided for the abrogation of certain provisions
of the General Treaty of 1856 and, as regards the Act of Algeciras,
for the renunciation “of the right to rely upon Articles 1 to 50,
54 to 65, 70, 71, all provisions of Article 72 after the word ‘permit’,



75, 76, 80, 97, IOI, 102, 104, 113 to 119”, and it also provided that
“in Article 81 the words ‘by the competent consular authority’
must be deemed to be omitted and in Article gr, the word ‘compe-
tent’ must henceforth be substituted for the word ‘consular’ ”.

It is clear that, in 1937, France (representing Morocco) and Great
Britain were proceeding upon the assumption that certain of the
provisions of the Act of Algeciras recognized a limited consular
jurisdiction for the purposes of the judicial proceedings therein
described.

The Court is not called upon to examine the particular articles
of the Act of Algeciras which are involved. It considers it sufficient
to state as its opinion that the consular jurisdiction of the United
States continues to exist to the extent that may be necessary to
render effective those provisions of the Act of Algeciras which
depend on the existence of consular jurisdiction.

nationals, unless assented to by the Government of the United



States, is linked with the regime of Capitulations, and it will not
be necessary to repeat the considerations which have already been
discussed in dealing with consular jurisdiction.

There is no provision in any of the treaties which have been
under consideration in this case conferring upon the United States
any such right. The so-called “right of assent’ is merely a corollary
of the system of consular jurisdiction. The consular courts applied
their own law and they were not bound in any way by Moroccan
law or Moroccan legislation. Before a consular court could give
effect to a Moroccan law it was necessary for the foreign Power
concerned to provide for its adoption as a law binding on the consul
in his judicial capacity. It was the usual practice to do this by
embodying it either in the legislation of the foreign State or in
ministerial or consular decrees of that State issued in pursuance of
delegated powers. The foreign State could have this done or it could
refuse to provide for the enforcement of the law. There was a ‘right
of assent” only to the extent that the intervention of the consular
court was necessary to secure the effective enforcement of a Moroc-
can law as against the foreign nationals.

In the absence of any treaty provisions dealing with this matter,
it has been contended that a ‘right of assent” can be based on
custom, usage or practice. It is unnecessary to repeat the reasons
which have been given for rejecting custom, usage and practice
as a basis for extended consular jurisdiction, and which are largely
applicable to the ‘right of assent”. It is, however, necessary to
point out that the very large number of instances in which Moroccan
laws were referred to the United States authorities can readily be
explained as a convenient way of ensuring their incorporation in
ministerial decrees binding upon the consular courts. In that way,
and in that way only, could these laws be made enforceable as
against United States nationals so long as the extended consular
jurisdiction was being exercised.

The problem arises in three ways, which must be considered
separately.

The first is in cases where the application of a Moroccan law to
United States nationals would be contrary to the treaty rights of
the United States. In such cases, the application of Moroccan laws,
whether directly or indirectly to these nationals, unless assented to
by the United States, would be contrary to international law, and
the dispute which might arise therefrom would have to be dealt
with according to the ordinary methods for the settlement of inter-
national disputes. These considerations apply to the Decree of
December 30th, 1948, which the Court has found to be contrary
to treaty rights of the United States.



The second way in which the problem arises is in cases in which
the co-operation of the consular courts is required in order to enforce
the Moroccan legislation. In such cases, regardless of whether the
application of the legislation would contravene treaty rights, the
assent of the United States would be essential to its enforcement
by the consular courts.

The third way in which the problem arises is in cases where the
application to United States nationals, otherwise than by enforce-
ment through the consular courts, of Moroccan laws which do not
violate any treaty rights of the United States is in question. In
such cases the assent of the United States authorities is not required.

Accordingly, and subject to the foregoing qualifications, the Court
holds that the United States is not entitled to claim that the applic-
ation of laws and regulations to its nationals in the French Zone
requires its assent.

The Government of the United States of America has submitted
a Counter-Claim, a part of which relates to the question of immunity
from Moroccan taxes in general, and particularly from the consump-
tion taxes provided by the Shereefian Dahir of February 28th, 1948.
The following Submissions are presented with regard to these ques-
tions :

On behalf of the Government of the United States :

“2. The treaties exempt American nationals from taxes, except
as specifically provided by the same treaties ; to collect taxes from
American nationals in violation of the terms of the treaties is a
breach of international law.

Such taxes can legally be collected from American nationals
only with the previous consent of the United States which operates
to waive temporarily its treaty right, and from the date upon which
such consent is given, unless otherwise specified by the terms of
the consent.

Consumption taxes provided by the Dahir of February 28, 1948,
which were collected from American nationals up to August 15,
1950, the date on which the United States consented to these
taxes, were illegally collected and should be refunded to them.

3. Since Moroccan laws do not become applicable to American
citizens until they have received the prior assent of the United
States Government, the lack of assent of the United States Govern-
ment to the Dahir of February 28, 1948, rendered illegal the collec-
tion of the consumption taxes provided by that Dahir.”

On behalf of the Government of France :

“That no treaty has conferred on the United States fiscal immun-
ity for its nationals in Morocco, either directly or through the
effect of the most-favoured-nation clause ;

3I


That the laws and regulations on fiscal matters which have been
put into force in the Shercefian Empire are applicable to the nationals
of the United States without the prior consent of the Government
of the United States ;

That, consequently, consumption taxes provided by the Dahir
of February 28th, 1948, have been legally collected from the nation-
als of the United States, and should not be refunded to them.”

The Government of the United States contends that its treaty
rights in Morocco confer upon United States nationals an immunity
from taxes except the taxes specifically recognized and permitted
by the treaties. This contention is based on certain bilateral treaties
with Morocco as well as on the Madrid Convention of 1880 and the
Act of Algeciras of 1906.

The Court will first consider the contention that the right to
fiscal immunity can be derived from the most-favoured-nation
clauses in Article 24 of the Treaty between the United States and
Morocco of 1836 and in Article 17 of the Madrid Convention, in
conjunction with certain provisions in treaties between Morocco
and Great Britain and Morocco and Spain.

The General Treaty between Great Britain and Morocco of 1856
provided in the second paragraph of Article IV that British subjects
“shall not be obliged to pay, under any pretence whatever, any
taxes or impositions’’. The Treaty between Morocco and Spain of
1861 provided in Article V that ‘Spanish subjects can not under
any pretext be forced to pay taxes or contributions”.

It is submitted on behalf of the United States that the most-
favoured-nation clauses in treaties with countries like Morocco were
not intended to create merely temporary or dependent rights, but
were intended to incorporate permanently these rights and render
them independent of the treaties by which they were originally
accorded. It is consequently contended that the right to fiscal
immunity accorded by the British General Treaty of 1856 and the
Spanish Treaty of 1861, was incorporated in the treaties which
guaranteed to the United States most-favoured-nation treatment,
with the result that this right would continue even if the rights and
privileges granted by the Treaties of 1856 and 1861 should come to
an end.

For the reasons stated above in connection with consular juris-
diction, the Court is unable to accept this contention. It is not
established that most-favoured-nation clauses in treaties with
Morocco have a meaning and effect other than such clauses in
other treaties or are governed by different rules of law. When pro-
visions granting fiscal immunity in treaties between Morocco and
third States have been abrogated or renounced, these provisions
can no longer be relied upon by virtuc of a most-favoured-nation
clause. In such circumstances, it becomes necessary to examine



whether the above-mentioned provisions in the Treaties of 1856
and 1861 are still in force.

The second paragraph of Article IV in the General Treaty with
Great Britain was abrogated by the Franco-British Convention of
July 29th, 1937, Protocol of Signature, Article 4 (a). As from the
coming into force of this Convention, that paragraph of Article IV
of the General Treaty of 1856 could no longer be relied upon by the
United States by virtue of a most-favoured-nation clause.

As already held above, the effect of the Declaration made by
France and Spain of March 7th, 1914, was an unconditional renun-
ciation by Spain of all the rights and privileges arising out of the
regime of Capitulations in the French Zone. This renunciation
involved, in the opinion of the Court, a renunciation by Spain of
the right of its nationals to immunity from taxes under Article V
of its Treaty with Morocco of 1861, since such a general and com-
plete immunity from taxes must be considered as an element of the
regime of capitulations in Morocco. When Spain relinquished all the
capitulatory rights, it must thereby be considered as having given
up the rights to fiscal immunity.

This view is confirmed by the attitude taken by number of other
States in this respect. Great Britain renounced all rights and privi-
leges of a capitulatory character in the French Zone by Article 1
of its Convention with France of 1937. In the Protocol of Signature
it was declared that the effect of this Article and of Article 16 is
to abrogate a number of articles in the General Treaty of 1856,
including, as has been stated above, the second paragraph of
Article IV. This seems to show that France, representing Morocco,
and Great Britain were proceeding on the assumption that the tax
immunity accorded by that Article was a right of a capitulatory
character. The other States, which, during the years 1914-1916,
equally renounced all rights and privileges arising out of the regime
of Capitulations in the French Zone, have acquiesced in the taxation
of their nationals.

For these reasons, the Court holds that the right to tax immunity
accorded by Article V of the Spanish Treaty of 1861, having been
surrendered by Spain, can no longer be invoked by the United
States by virtue of a most-favoured-nation clause.

The Government of the United States has further contended that
it has an independent claim to tax immunity by virtue of being a
party to the Convention of Madrid and the Act of Algeciras. It
contends that by these instruments a regime as to taxes was set
up, which continued the tax immunity in favour of the nationals
of foreign States, thereby confirming and incorporating this pre-
existing regime, which therefore is still in force, except for the
States which have agreed to give it up.

The Court is, however, of opinion that the Madrid Convention
did not confirm and incorporate the then existing principle of tax



immunity. It merely pre-supposed the existence of this principle
and curtailed it by exceptions in Articles 12 and 13 without modi-
fying its legal basis. It did not provide a new and independent
ground for any claim of tax immunity.

Similar considerations apply to the Act of Algeciras, which further
curtailed the regime of tax immunity by exceptions in Articles 59,
61, 64, and 65. It did not provide any new and independent legal
basis for exemption from taxes.

The Government of the United States has invoked Articles 2 and
3 of the Madrid Convention, which grant exemption from taxes,
other than those mentioned in Articles 12 and 13, to certain ‘“pro-
tected persons”. But the “‘protégés” mentioned in Articles 2 and 3
constituted only a limited class of persons in the service of diplo-
matic representatives and consuls of foreign States. No conclusion
as to tax immunity for nationals of the United States in general
can, in the opinion of the Court, be drawn from the privileges
granted to this limited class of protected persons.

It is finally contended, on behalf of the Government of the
United States, that the consumption taxes imposed by the Dahir of
February 28th, 1048, are in contravention of special treaty rights.
Reference is made to the Treaty of Commerce between Great
Britain and Morocco of 1856, Articles III, VII, VIII and IX, and
it is submitted that United States nationals are exempt from those
consumption taxes by virtue of these Articles in conjunction with
the most-favoured-nation clauses in the Treaty of 1836 between
Morocco and the United States.

These four Articles in the British Commercial Treaty of 1856
relate to taxes and duties on goods exported from or imported into
Morocco, or on goods conveyed from one Moroccan port to another.
The consumption taxes provided by the Dahir of February 28th,
1948, are, according to its Article 8, payable on all products whether
they are imported into the French Zone of Morocco or manufac-
tured or produced there. They can not, therefore, be assimilated
to the particular taxes mentioned in the articles of the British
Commercial Treaty, invoked by the United States, nor can they
be considered as a customs duty. The mere fact that it may be
convenient in the case of imported goods to collect the consumption
tax at the Customs Office does not alter its essential character as a
tax levied upon all goods, whether imported into, or produced in,
Morocco. It may be recalled in this connection that the Permanent
Court of International Justice recognized that fiscal duties collected
at the frontier on the entry of certain goods were not to be confused
with customs duties ; in its Judgment of June 7th, 1932, in the
Free Zones Case (P.C.1.]., Series A/B, No. 46, p. 172), it laid down
that ‘’the withdrawal of the customs line does not affect the right



of the French Government to collect at the political frontier fiscal
duties not possessing the character of customs duties”.

The Court is, consequently, unable to hold that the imposition
of these consumption taxes contravenes any treaty rights of the
United States. In such circumstances the question of a partial
refund of consumption taxes paid by United States nationals does
not arise.

It follows from the above-mentioned considerations that the
Government of the United States is not entitled to claim that
taxes, including consumption taxes, shall be submitted to the
previous consent of that Government before they can legally be
collected from nationals of the United States. Since they are, in the
opinion of the Court, not exempt from the payment of any taxes
in the French Zone, there is no legal basis for the claim that laws
and regulations on fiscal matters shall be submitted to United
States authorities for approval.

The conclusion which the Court has thus arrived at seems to be
in accordance with the attitude which other States have taken with
regard to this question. Tax immunity in the French Zone is not
claimed either by the United Kingdom or by Spain or any other
State which previously enjoyed such a privileged position. The
only State now claiming this privilege is the United States, though
no tax immunity is guaranteed by its Treaty with Morocco of
1836. To recognize tax immunity for United States nationals
alone would not be compatible with the principle of equality of
treatment in economic matters on which the Act of Algeciras is
based.

transportation to the custom-house in Morocco, exclusive of all
expenses following its delivery to the custom-house, such as customs
duties and storage fees.

It is a violation of the Act of Algeciras and a breach of inter-
national law for the customs authorities to depart from the method
of valuation so defined and to determine the value of imported
merchandise for customs purposes by relying on the value of the
imported merchandise on the local Moroccan market.”



The final Submission of the Government of France upon this part
of the Counter-Claim is as follows :
“That Article 95 of the Act of Algeciras defines value for customs

purposes as the value of the merchandise at the time and at the
place where it is presented for customs clearance ;”

which, as was made clear in the oral argument, means the value in
the local, 1.e. Moroccan, market.

The necessity, evidenced by Articles 95, 96 and 97 of the Act
of Algeciras, of creating some kind of machinery for securing a
just valuation of goods by the Customs authorities would appear to
follow, inter alia, (a) from the principle of economic equality which
is one of the principles underlying the Act, and (4) from the fact
that the import duties were fixed by the signatory Powers at 12} %.
Clearly, it would be easy, if it were desired to do so, to discriminate
against particular importers by means of arbitrary valuations or to
evade a fixed limitation of duties by means of inflated valuations.
But while the signatory Powers realized the necessity for some such
machinery, it does not appear that the machinery has given rise
to a practice which has been consistently followed since the Act
entered into force.

Article 95 specifies four factors in valuing merchandise :

(a) the valuation must be based upon its cash wholesale value ;

(b) the time and place of the valuation are fixed at the entry of
the merchandise at the custom-house ;

(ce) the merchandise must be valued “free from customs’ duties
and storage dues”, that is to say, the value must not include these
charges ;

(d) the valuation must take account of depreciation resulting
from damage, if any.

Article 96, which relates only to the principal goods taxed by the
Moorish Customs Administration, contemplated an annual fixing
of values by a ‘Committee on Customs Valuations’ sitting at
Tangier. The local character of this Committee, and of the persons
whom it is directed to consult, should be noted. The schedule of
values fixed by it was to be subject to revision at the end of six
months if any considerable changes had taken place in the value of
certain goods. Article 96 is procedural and is intended to operate
within the ambit of Article 95.

Article 97 provided for the establishment of a permanent “Com-
mittee of Customs”, intended to supervise the customs service on
a high level and to watch over the application of Article 96 and
97, subject to the advice and consent of the ‘Diplomatic Body at
Tangier”.

The Committee on Customs Valuations referred to in Article 96
appears to have lapsed in 1924 when the Convention of Decem-


ber 18th, 1923, on the Tangier Zone came into force, and replaced
it by a Committee representing the three Zones. The latter Com-
mittee has not met since 1936.

Articles 82 to 86 of the Act, which relate to declarations by
importers, must also be noted. Article 82 requires an importer to
file a declaration, which must contain a detailed statement setting
forth the nature, quality, weight, number, measurement and value
of the merchandise, as well as the nature, marks and numbers of
the packages containing the same. A declaration of value made by
the importer can clearly not be decisive, because he is an interested
party, but at the same time he knows more about the goods than
anybody else, and, unless fraud is suspected, it is right that the
value appearing in the declaration should form an important ele-
ment in the valuation about to be made.

It can not be said that the provisions of Article g5 alone, or of
Chapter V of the Act considered as a whole, afford decisive evidence
in support of either of the interpretations contended for by the
Parties respectively. The four factors specified by Article g5 are
consistent with either interpretation ; in particular, the expression
“free from customs duties and storage dues’ affords no clear indica-
tion, because, if the value in the country of origin, increased by the
amount of insurance, freight, etc., is to be taken as the basis, this
expression means “before entering the customs office and paying
duties’ ; whereas, if the value in the local market is to be accepted
as the basis, some such expression is necessary (or at any rate
prudent) in order to indicate that the duty of 12} % must not be
levied on a value which already contains the 123 %.-

The Court has examined the earlier practice, and the preparatory
work of the Conference of Algeciras of 1906, but not much guidance
is obtainable from these sources. The Commercial Agreement made
between France and Morocco, dated October 4th, 1892, consists of
two letters exchanged between the Foreign Minister of Morocco and
the Minister of France in Morocco, the latter of which contains the
expression :

“These goods shall be assessed on the basis of their cash wholesale
market value in the port of discharge, in reals of vellon.”

A preliminary draft of the Act (p. 97 of French Documents diplo-
maliques, 1906, fascicule 1, Affaires du Maroc, entitled “II. Proto-
coles et comptes rendus de la Conférence d’Algésiras”) contains
the following article :

“Article XIX —Import and export duties shall be paid forthwith
in cash at the custom-house where clearance is effected. The ad
valorem duties shall be determined and paid on the basis of the cash
wholesale value of the goods at the port of discharge or the custom-



house in the case of imports. Merchandise can only be removed after
the payment of customs duties and storage.

The holding of the goods or the collection of duty shall, in every
case, be made the subject of a regular receipt delivered by the officer
in charge.”

Later (p. 100), upon a British proposal, the second sentence was
modified so as to read :

“The ad valorem duties shall be determined and paid on the basis
of the cash wholesale value of the goods at the custom-house, free
from customs duties.”

At a later stage the German delegation made the following pro-
posal (ibid., p. 232) :

“The ad valorem duties imposed on imports in Morocco shall be
assessed on the value of the imported goods in the place of shipment
or of purchase, to which shall be added the transport and insurance
charges to the port of discharge in Morocco...”

That amendment was rejected, from which it may be inferred
that the value in the country of origin was rejected as the conclusive
test.

It is also necessary to examine the practice of the customs
authorities since 1906, in so far as it appears from the materials
made available to the Court by the Parties. It seems that there has
been a reluctance to attribute a decisive effect to any single factor
in valuing merchandise.

For instance, in a letter of July 16th, 1912, from the Controller
of Moroccan Customs to the American Minister at Tangier, it 1s
stated that the customs officers ‘apply for the appraisal of mer-
chandise the rules established by the Act of Algeciras and by the
Customs regulations. They use market prices, bills of sale and their
professional knowledge.”

The following excerpts occur later in the same letter :

“The bill of sale is an element of valuation, but it is not conclusive
evidence.

The customs has always proceeded as described above in regard
to petroleum products imported from Fiume and from Trieste ;
for which importers furnish means of appraisal by attaching to the
declarations the original bills of sale, of which the prices are com-
pared with the market prices of origin.

This value [i.e. for customs purposes] includes the purchase
price of the petroleum f.o.b. New York, increased by all expenses
subsequent to the purchase, such as export duties paid to foreign
customs, transportation, packing, freight, insurance, handling,


unloading, etc. —in short, all that contributes to make up at the
moment of presentation at the customs office the cash wholesale
value of the product, according to which, under Article 95 of the
Act of Algeciras, the duties must be paid.

3>

It is also interesting to note from the Minutes of the meeting at
Tangier of the Committee on Customs Valuations on June 7th,
1933, that the Director of Customs explained :

“.... that his Department adopts as elements of valuation for the
application of the duties concerned, the invoice of origin, transport
costs to the port of importation, the value of the merchandise on
the local market on arrival, general market price lists and any
other information which may be useful to fix the value upon which
the duty is based”.

On the other hand, passages can be found in the Customs regula-
tions and in circulars issued by the Moroccan Debt Control in
which the emphasis is laid upon the value in the Moroccan market
as the important factor. The latest “Tables of minimum and
maximum values of the principal merchandise imported into
Morocco”, adopted by the Committee on Customs Valuations at
their last meeting on March 11th, 1936, at Tangier, reveal a range
so great that they could only afford the most general guidance as
to the actual valuation of a particular cargo or piece of merchandise.

The general impression created by an examination of the relevant
materials is that those responsible for the administration of the
customs since the date of the Act of Algeciras have made use of
all the various elements of valuation available to them, though
perhaps not always in a consistent manner.

In these circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that Article 95
lays down no strict rule on the point in dispute. It requires an
interpretation which is more flexible than either of those which
are respectively contended for by the Parties in this case.

The Court is of the opinion that it is the duty of the Customs
authorities in the French Zone, in fixing the valuation of imported
goods for customs purposes, to have regard to the following factors :

(a) the four factors specified by Article 95 and mentioned above ;

(b) the contents of the declaration which the importer is required
by the Act to file in the custom-house ;
(c) the wholesale cash value in the market of the French Zone ;

(d) the cost in the country of origin, increased by the cost of
loading and unloading, insurance, freight, and other charges
incurred before the goods are delivered at the custom-house ;



(e) the schedule of values, if any, which may have been prepared
by the Committee on Customs Valuations referred to in Article 96
or by any committee which may have been substituted therefor
by arrangements to which France and the United States have
assented expressly or by implication ;

(1) any other factor which is required by the special circumstances
of a particular consignment or kind of merchandise.

The factors referred to above are not arranged in order of priority
but should operate freely, within any limits that have been, or
may be, prescribed under Article 96 of the Act ; and, in view of
the governing principle of economic equality, the same methods
must be applied without discrimination to all importations, regard-
less of the origin of the goods or the nationality of the importers.
The power of making the valuation rests with the Customs author-
ities, but it is a power which must be exercised reasonably and in
good faith.

Judge Hsu Mo declares that, in his opinion, the jurisdictional
rights of the United States of America in the French Zone of Morocco
are limited to those provided in Articles 20 and 21 of its Treaty with
Morocco of September 16th, 1836, and that the United States is
not entitled to exercise consular jurisdiction in cases involving the
application to United States citizens of those provisions of the Act
of Algeciras of 19606 which, for their enforcement, carried certain
sanctions. The Act of Algeciras, as far as the jurisdictional clauses
are concerned, was concluded on the basis of a kind of consular
jurisdiction as it existed at that time in its full form and in complete
uniformity among the Powers in Morocco. The various provisions,
in referring to “consular jurisdiction”, ‘‘competent consular
authority”, “consular court of the defendant”, etc., clearly meant
that jurisdiction which was being uniformly exercised by foreign
States over their respective nationals as defendants in all cases.
They did not mean such limited jurisdiction as might be exercised
by the United States consular courts, in accordance with Article zo
of the Moroccan-United States Treaty of 1836, in cases involving
United States citizens or protégés only. When, therefore, consular
jurisdiction in its full form ceased to exist in respect of all the signa-
tory States to the Act of Algeciras, the basis for the application by
the various consular tribunals of the measures of sanction provided
in that Act disappeared, and the ordinary rules of international
law came into play. Consequently, such sanctions should thence-
forth be applied by the territorial courts, in the case of United
States citizens as well as in the case of all other foreign nationals.
As regards reference in the Franco-British Convention of 1937 to
the jurisdictional privileges enjoyed by the United States, it must
be considered as a precautionary measure on the part of France
against the possibility of the refusal of the United States to relin-
quish such privileges. In any case, the rights of the United States
vis-a-vis Morocco in matters of jurisdiction must be determined
by their own treaty relations, and could not derive from any
admission made by France on Morocco’s behalf to a third party.
