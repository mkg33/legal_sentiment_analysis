                                      (NICARAGUA v. COLOMBIA)



           General background  Geography  The Court’s 2012 Judgment in Territorial and
     Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia) delimiting the Parties’ continental shelves and exclusive
     economic zones up to a 200-nautical-mile limit from Nicaragua’s coast  Application filed by
     Nicaragua on 16 September 2013  Request to determine maritime boundary in areas of continental
     shelf beyond the boundaries determined in 2012 Judgment  Delimitation lines proposed by
     Nicaragua in its written pleadings  The Court’s Order of 4 October 2022  Certain questions of
     law to be decided first.



                                                      *



            First question formulated in the Order of 4 October 2022  Whether a State’s entitlement to
     a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its baselines may extend within 200 nautical miles
     from the baselines of another State  Determination of the existence of overlapping entitlements as

     up of UNCLOS at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (the “Conference”) 

                                               -2-

State practice taken into account during the drafting of UNCLOS  Method of negotiation of
UNCLOS  Comprehensive and integrated text forming a package deal  Relationship between
Part V of UNCLOS on the exclusive economic zone and Part VI on the continental shelf specified in
Article 56, paragraph 3, of UNCLOS  Article 56 of UNCLOS reflects customary rules on rights
and duties in the exclusive economic zone  Definition of continental shelf in Article 76,
paragraph 1, of UNCLOS forms part of customary international law.

       Legal régime governing the exclusive economic zone set out in UNCLOS result of a
compromise reached at the Conference  Articles 56, 58, 61, 62 and 73 of UNCLOS on rights and
duties of coastal States and other States in the exclusive economic zone reflect customary
international law  Interrelated nature of legal régimes that govern the exclusive economic zone
and continental shelf within 200 nautical miles from a State’s baselines  There cannot be an
exclusive economic zone without a corresponding continental shelf  Question of “grey area” 
Incidental result of adjustment of equidistance line  Circumstances in Bay of Bengal cases distinct
