       1. I have voted with some reluctance in favour of the operative part of this Judgment. While I
accept that the Court, being a court of justice, cannot exceed the inherent limitations incumbent upon
it in the exercise of its judicial function, I wonder if justice is served when the Court renders a
judgment of the kind it rendered today. Moreover, I am disappointed with the uncritical and
somewhat impressionistic way in which the Court has ascertained whether certain points concerning
the status and use of the waters of the Silala were still in dispute between the Parties at the time of
the decision. These concerns have compelled me to append the present separate opinion.

       2. It is a curiosity of this Judgment that it decides almost nothing. The Court has rendered a
Judgment which is compact, almost “transactional” in form 1. Of the five claims advanced by Chile
and three counter-claims advanced by Bolivia, two are rejected (Judgment, paras. 128 and 162) and
six are found to no longer have any object such that the Court is not called upon to give a decision
thereon (ibid., paras. 59, 65, 76, 86, 147 and 155). The reasons given in the Judgment are on the
whole confined to recording the various shifts and changes in the Respondent’s case made in the
course of the proceedings. The operative part of the Judgment has little “operative” about it. With
the exception of point 5, which concerns Chile’s submission (e), the operative part of the Judgment
does not settle any of the points in dispute between the Parties (ibid., para. 163 (5)).

       3. Why did the Court render such a Judgment? How did the mountain give birth to the
proverbial mouse? The answer lies in the disappearance of most of the points in dispute between the
Parties during the proceedings. I wish to make three sets of observations in this regard.

      5. This statement appears to have prompted the Applicant to institute proceedings before the
Court, asking, essentially, for a declaratory judgment as to the nature of the Silala River. This kind
of judgment is designed to “ensure recognition of a situation at law, once and for all and with binding
force as between the [p]arties; so that the legal position thus established cannot again be called in
question in so far as the legal effects ensuing therefrom are concerned” 2.

       6. I do not find it necessary to dwell on the many ways the dispute has been altered by the
Respondent’s shifts and changes throughout the proceedings. The Court takes note of these shifts
and changes with sobriety (Judgment, paras. 52, 53, 62, 68, 79 and 152). The basic point is that the
Respondent admitted the soundness of the Applicant’s case on the Silala and relinquished most of its
claims. In their final submissions and in their oral arguments, both Parties therefore asked the Court
to reject some or all of the other Party’s submissions on the ground that they no longer had any object
because the Parties agreed with respect to the subject-matter of these submissions.

      8. I agree that the existence of a dispute at the time of the decision is a condition for the Court
to render a judgment on the merits and to pass upon the parties’ submissions. As the Court
emphasized in the case concerning Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), “[t]he dispute brought before
[the Court] must . . . continue to exist at the time when the Court makes its decision”3. There must
be an element of “actual” dispute.

       9. The Judgment’s test to decide whether a dispute has disappeared in the proceedings seems
to me too low a bar. The Judgment asserts in paragraph 42 that the Court must “ascertain whether
specific claims have become without object as a consequence of a convergence of positions or
agreement between the Parties, or for some other reason” (emphasis added). I am not aware of any
case where the Court has used the “convergence of positions” standard. To my mind, a finding that
a point in dispute has disappeared during the proceedings calls for a high threshold because of the
important repercussions it may have on the case. It may cause the Court to decide not to render a
judgment or it may significantly narrow the decision to be rendered by the Court (as illustrated by
the present Judgment). A “convergence of positions” is not an agreement. Parties before the Court
may converge on the manner in which a problem arises but disagree on the solution of that problem.
Parties whose views have converged may still wish to obtain from the Court a recognition and
statement of the situation at law between them on the points which are still in dispute.

       10. The Judgment concludes that the Parties agree on five claims, namely submissions (a), (b),
(c) and (d) of Chile and Bolivia’s counter-claim (a) (Judgment, paras. 59, 65, 76, 86 and 146-147). I
agree. The Judgment also concludes that the Parties’ positions have converged with regard to one
submission, namely Bolivia’s counter-claim (b) (ibid., para. 155). I am more sceptical about this
conclusion. This brings me to my second set of observations which touches on the Court’s
interpretation of Bolivia’s counter-claim (b).

                        II. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

       11. The Court had to interpret the Parties’ submissions to determine whether they reflected a
dispute between them. The Judgment asserts that the Court “will take into account not only the
submissions, but also, inter alia, the Application as well as all the arguments put forward by the
Parties in the course of the written and oral proceedings” (Judgment, para. 43). Citing the case
concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, the Judgment also emphasizes that the
Court has no power to “substitute itself for [the parties] and formulate new submissions simply on
the basis of arguments and facts advanced” 4. This is understood: the Court is always required to rule
on the final submissions of the parties as formulated at the close of the oral proceedings 5.

       12. I am not convinced that the Court faithfully followed the methodology thus stated when
interpreting Bolivia’s counter-claims, in particular counter-claim (b).


        13. For context: Bolivia’s counter-claim (b), as formulated in its Counter-Memorial and
Rejoinder, asked the Court to adjudge and declare that “Bolivia has sovereignty over the artificial
flow of Silala waters engineered, enhanced, or produced in its territory and Chile has no right to that
artificial flow” (Judgment, para. 26). This submission reflected Bolivia’s new theory of its case (by
then it had abandoned its diversion theory 6) that the Silala waters are part of an “artificially enhanced
watercourse”. Bolivia referred to what it called the “artificial flow” of the Silala, explaining that
international and domestic judicial decisions “recognize the legal relevance of the distinction
between the existence of natural and artificial flows”7. It contended that its sovereignty over the
waterworks located within its territory afforded it full sovereignty over the artificial flow of waters
generated by the waterworks. The upshot of this view was that Chile could not use the “artificial
flows” without Bolivia’s consent. This was the theory underpinning counter-claim (b).

       14. Counter-claim (b) became untenable when, not a moment too soon during the oral
proceedings, the Respondent acknowledged that Chile’s right to make equitable and reasonable use
of the waters of the Silala covers the entirety of the waters (Judgment, para. 63).


       15. At this point, it may be thought that the Respondent would have abandoned its
counter-claim. It did not. Instead, the Respondent reformulated counter-claim (b), suggesting a
strained interpretation which is inconsistent with that claim’s very wording.

Court to adjudge and declare that “Bolivia has sovereignty over the artificial flow of Silala waters
engineered, enhanced, or produced in its territory and Chile has no acquired right to that artificial
flow” (emphasis added). The terms of the submission are clear, and the reader is justified in assuming
that they mean what they say. The fig leaf added (the word “acquired”) does not alchemize its
purport. The origin of the submission must also be borne in mind. In the light of this, it escapes me

        6 The experts of the Parties agreed that the Silala River flows naturally from Bolivia to Chile due to the

topographical gradient. See Counter-Memorial of Bolivia, Vol. 2, Ann. 17, Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI), Study of the
Flows in the Silala Wetlands and Springs System, 2018, p. 266, para. 10 (noting that “without canals, both surface and
groundwater will cross the border”); Reply of Chile, H. S. Wheater and D. W. Peach, Impacts of Channelization of the

agree that “[t]he Silala River flows naturally from Bolivia to Chile”).

how the Judgment interprets this submission as requesting the Court to adjudge and declare that
Bolivia has the “sovereign right” to decide whether and how to maintain the channels and drainage
mechanisms located in its territory (Judgment, para. 153) 8.

       I note that the Court, in the end, rejects the Respondent’s theory of sovereignty over the
“artificial flow” in a brief yet illuminating passage (ibid., para. 93). Rightly so. This theory is
inconsistent with international and domestic decisions on the matter 9.

       18. This brings me to my third and final set of observations. States appearing before the Court
have a legitimate interest in seeking declaratory judgments that may ensure recognition of a situation
at law, once and for all and with binding force. In order to be binding, this recognition must be clothed
in the operative part of the judgment, which alone is binding on the parties. I am troubled that the
present Judgment might be read as sending the signal that any position may be held, however
untenable, so long as this position is abandoned at the eleventh hour of the judicial proceedings. In
this regard, I see a difference between a dispute that has disappeared because the parties genuinely
have come to agree in the course of the proceedings, and a dispute that has been hollowed out by one
party wishing to evade a declaratory judgment and the legal effects ensuing therefrom.

       19. I am perplexed as to why the Judgment does not record the agreement of the Parties reached
in the course of the proceedings. In the circumstances of this case, it would have been appropriate
and helpful to the Parties. In the case concerning Société Commerciale de Belgique, the Court’s
predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, stated in the operative clause that it
“not[ed] the agreement between the Parties” 10. The agreement in question was arrived at towards the
end of the oral proceedings, as a consequence of declarations of the Greek Government (in fact,

are located in its territory [note the lapalissade!] and has the right to decide whether and how to maintain them”, emphasis
added.

treated as “changing the character of the dispute”, leading it to withdraw part of its original
submissions 11. This situation is uncannily analogous to the one which presented itself here.


       20. States do not institute proceedings before the World Court at the drop of a hat. The cases
they bring to the Court are usually of considerable importance legally and politically and the volume
of preparation and work involved is significant, sometimes enormous. Hundreds of professionals
may be involved. Technical or scientific expertise may be mobilized. The Court owes it to the parties
to render well-reasoned judgments which settle their disputes with binding force, and, where
appropriate, offers them guidance on their rights and obligations. Reflecting on the Court’s
deliberative process, the then President of the Permanent Court of International Justice, Max Huber,
once compared the Court’s decisions to “ships which are intended to be launched on the high seas of
international criticism” 12. It is a pity that today the Court chose to launch an empty vessel.
