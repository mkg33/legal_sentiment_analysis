Nations. There was however no indication that the commitment under-
taken would be conditional on acceptance of the claim of continuity.
That claim did not in fact prevail. Nonetheless, the conduct of Serbia
after the transmission of the declaration made it clear that it regarded
itself bound by the Genocide Convention.

   112. Serbia has however drawn the attention of the Court to Arti-
cle XI of the Genocide Convention, which provides that :
        “The present Convention shall be open until 31 December 1949
      for signature on behalf of any Member of the United Nations and of
      any non-member State to which an invitation to sign has been
      addressed by the General Assembly.
        The present Convention shall be ratified, and the instruments of
      ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the
      United Nations.
        After 1 January 1950, the present Convention may be acceded to
      on behalf of any Member of the United Nations and of any non-
      member State which has received an invitation as aforesaid.

       Instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Secretary-
      General of the United Nations.”
Serbia contends the following :
        “Before it became a Member of the United Nations on 1 Novem-
      ber 2000 as a new State, the Respondent was not even qualified to be
      a party to the Genocide Convention. Since it was not [prior to that
      date] a Member of the United Nations, it could only have become a
      party upon an invitation extended under Article XI. It is an undis-
      puted fact that the FRY never received such an invitation.”

   113. The Court observes that Article XI, according to its terms, does
not exclude States not Members of the United Nations from being
parties to the Genocide Convention, as Serbia suggests ; it provides sim-
ply that non-signatory States may only accede to the Convention if they
are United Nations Member States or States who have received an invita-
tion from the General Assembly. The text does not make any reference to
continuation of, or succession to, the treaty rights and obligations of a
predecessor State, in the manner and on the conditions recognized in
international law. In the case concerning the Application of the Conven-
tion on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia
and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), the question was raised
whether a “Notice of Succession” to the Convention transmitted by Bos-
nia and Herzegovina was not to be treated as an accession, to which Arti-
cles XI and XIII of the Convention would apply. The Court held that
Bosnia and Herzegovina had become a party to the Convention by way
of succession, and concluded from this that “the question of the applica-




tion of Articles XI and XIII of the Convention does not arise” (Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 612, para. 24).

   114. The position adopted by the FRY itself in relation to the Conven-
tion has already been referred to, and is clearly conduct that must be
taken into account by the Court. As early as 1993, in the context of the
first request for the indication of provisional measures in the proceedings
brought against it by Bosnia and Herzegovina, the FRY, while question-
ing whether the applicant State was a party to the Genocide Convention
at the relevant dates, did not challenge the claim that it was itself a party,
and itself presented a request for the indication of provisional measures,
referring to Article IX of the Convention. On this basis, the Court in its
Order found that “both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia are parties”
to the Convention (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugo-
slavia (Serbia and Montenegro)), Provisional Measures, Order of
8 April 1993, I.C.J. Reports 1993, p. 16, para. 26), and cited the 1992 decla-
ration and Note (ibid., p. 15, paras. 22-23). Moreover, in the same case,
at the preliminary objections stage, the FRY argued that the Genocide
Convention had begun to apply to relations between the two Parties on
14 December 1995, as recalled above (see paragraph 82), having itself
continued the rights and duties, under (inter alia) that Convention,
established by the SFRY. Furthermore, on 29 April 1999 the FRY filed
in the Registry of the Court Applications instituting proceedings against
ten States Members of NATO, citing (inter alia) the Genocide Conven-
tion as title of jurisdiction (see, for example, Legality of Use of Force
(Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), pp. 283-284, para. 1).

   115. This was still the situation when on 2 July 1999 Croatia filed the
Application instituting the present proceedings. During the period
between the making of the 1992 declaration and that date, neither the
FRY nor any other State for which the issue might have had significance
questioned that the FRY was a party to the Genocide Convention, with-
out reservations ; and no other event occurring during that period had
any impact on the legal situation arising from the 1992 declaration. On
1 November 2000, the FRY was admitted as a new Member of the
United Nations, as it had requested by a letter addressed to the Secre-
tary-General by the President of the FRY dated 27 October 2000, “in
light of the implementation of Security Council resolution 777 (1992)”
(United Nations doc. A/55/528-S/2000/1043). As the Court observed in
its Judgments in the cases concerning the Legality of Use of Force, “[t]his
new development effectively put an end to the sui generis position of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within the United Nations . . .” (Legality
of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objec-
tions, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 310, para. 78). Nevertheless,
the FRY did not at that time withdraw, or purport to withdraw, the dec-




laration and Note of 1992, which had been drawn up in the light of the
contention that the FRY was continuing the legal personality of the
SFRY. It did not, for example, suggest that the failure of that contention
to gain acceptance had entailed the nullity of the declaration, or cessation
of the commitment to the international obligations contemplated by it.
   116. It was not until March 2001 that the FRY took any further step
inconsistent with the status which it had since 1992 been claiming to pos-
sess, namely that of a State party to the Genocide Convention. On
12 March 2001 it deposited with the Secretary-General a notification of
accession to the Genocide Convention, which, after referring to the 1992
declaration and to the subsequent admission of the FRY to the United
Nations as a new Member, contained the following :
         “NOW it has been established that the Federal Republic of Yugo-
      slavia has not succeeded on April 27, 1992, or on any later date, to
      treaty membership, rights and obligations of the Socialist Federal
      Republic of Yugoslavia in the Convention on the Prevention and
      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on the assumption of contin-
      ued membership in the United Nations and continued state, inter-
      national legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal
      Republic of Yugoslavia . . .”


The notification of accession contained the following reservation :
        “‘The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not consider itself
      bound by Article IX of the Convention . . . and, therefore, before
      any dispute to which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a party
      may be validly submitted to the jurisdiction of the International
      Court of Justice under this Article, the specific and explicit consent
      of the FRY is required in each case.’”
   However, the Court notes also that on that same date, the FRY depos-
ited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations declarations of
succession to a large number of other multilateral conventions of which
the Secretary-General is depositary. This practice of the FRY was fully
consistent with that of the other former States emerging from the dissolu-
tion of the SFRY, which also saw themselves as successors to that State,
and thus had, during the period from 1991 on, notified their succession to
those conventions. There was indeed (other than the accession of the
FRY to the Genocide Convention) only one exception to that very exten-
sive and consistent body of practice.
   117. In sum, in the present case the Court, taking into account both
the text of the declaration and Note of 27 April 1992, and the consistent
conduct of the FRY at the time of its making and throughout the years
1992-2001, considers that it should attribute to those documents precisely
the effect that they were, in the view of the Court, intended to have on
the face of their terms : namely, that from that date onwards the FRY




would be bound by the obligations of a party in respect of all the multi-
lateral conventions to which the SFRY had been a party at the time of its
dissolution, subject of course to any reservations lawfully made by the
SFRY limiting its obligations. It is common ground that the Genocide
Convention was one of these conventions, and that the SFRY had made
no reservation to it ; thus the FRY in 1992 accepted the obligations of
that Convention, including Article IX providing for the jurisdiction of
the Court and that jurisdictional commitment was binding on the Respon-
dent at the date the present proceedings were instituted. In the events that
have occurred, this signifies that the 1992 declaration and Note had the
effect of a notification of succession by the FRY to the SFRY in relation
to the Genocide Convention. The Court concludes that, subject to the
more specific objections of Serbia to be examined below, it had, on the
date on which the present proceedings were instituted, jurisdiction to
entertain the case on the basis of Article IX of the Genocide Convention.
That situation continued at least until 1 November 2000, the date on
which Serbia and Montenegro became a Member of the United Nations
and thus a party to the Statute of the Court.

  Accordingly, there is no need to consider the contentions of Croatia
based on more general issues relating to the rules of international law
concerning succession of States to treaties, referred to in paragraph 101
above.


   120. The Court therefore now turns to the second preliminary objec-
tion as stated in Serbia’s final submission 2 (a), namely the objection
that “claims based on acts and omissions which took place prior to
27 April 1992”, that is to say prior to the formal establishment of the
“Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)”, the name
by which the present Serbia was formerly known, “are beyond the juris-
diction of this Court and inadmissible”. The preliminary objection is thus
presented as, at one and the same time, an objection to jurisdiction and
one going to the admissibility of the claims. A distinction between these
two kinds of objections is well recognized in the practice of the Court. In
either case, the effect of a preliminary objection to a particular claim is
that, if upheld, it brings the proceedings in respect of that claim to an
end ; so that the Court will not go on to consider the merits of the claim.
If the objection is a jurisdictional objection, then since the jurisdiction of
the Court derives from the consent of the parties, this will most usually
be because it has been shown that no such consent has been given by the
objecting State to the settlement by the Court of the particular dispute. A
preliminary objection to admissibility covers a more disparate range of
possibilities. In the case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of
Iran v. United States of America) the Court noted that :

         “Objections to admissibility normally take the form of an asser-
      tion that, even if the Court has jurisdiction and the facts stated
      by the applicant State are assumed to be correct, nonetheless
      there are reasons why the Court should not proceed to an
      examination of the merits.” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 177,
      para. 29.)
Essentially such an objection consists in the contention that there exists
a legal reason, even when there is jurisdiction, why the Court should
decline to hear the case, or more usually, a specific claim therein.
Such a reason is often of such a nature that the matter should be resolved
in limine litis, for example where without examination of the merits
it may be seen that there has been a failure to comply with the rules
as to nationality of claims ; failure to exhaust local remedies ; the
agreement of the parties to use another method of pacific settlement ;
or mootness of the claim. If the Court finds that an objection “does
not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an exclusively
preliminary character” (Article 79, paragraph 7, of the Rules of Court
as adopted on 14 April 1978), it will be dealt with at the merits stage.
Challenges either to jurisdiction or to admissibility are sometimes
in fact presented along with arguments on the merits, and argued and
determined at that stage (cf. East Timor (Portugal v. Australia),
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 92, para. 4 ; Avena and Other Mexican




Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 2004 (I), pp. 28-29, para. 24).

   121. As set out above, Serbia’s preliminary objection, as stated in its
final submission 2 (a), is presented as relating both to the jurisdiction of
the Court and to the admissibility of the claim. The title of jurisdiction
relied on by Croatia is Article IX of the Genocide Convention, and the
Court has established above that Croatia and Serbia were both parties to
that Convention on the date on which proceedings were instituted
(2 July 1999). Serbia’s contention is however that the Court has no juris-
diction under Article IX, or that jurisdiction cannot be exercised, so far
as the claim of Croatia concerns “acts and omissions that took place
prior to 27 April 1992”, i.e., that the Court’s jurisdiction is limited
ratione temporis. Serbia advanced two reasons for this : first, because the
earliest possible point in time at which the Convention could be found to
have entered into force between the FRY and Croatia was 27 April 1992 ;
and secondly, because “the Genocide Convention including the jurisdic-
tional clause contained in its Article IX cannot be applied with regard to
acts that occurred before Serbia came into existence as a State”, and
could thus not have become binding upon it. Serbia therefore contended
that acts or omissions which took place before the FRY came into exist-
ence cannot possibly be attributed to the FRY.

   122. In that respect, Croatia has drawn the attention of the Court to
the fact that a similar question of jurisdiction ratione temporis under the
Genocide Convention in respect of the events in the former Yugoslavia
was dealt with by the Court in the case concerning the Application of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), in response to two of the pre-
liminary objections of the FRY. In that Judgment the Court found that

         “Yugoslavia, basing its contention on the principle of the non-
      retroactivity of legal acts, has . . . asserted . . . that, even though the
      Court might have jurisdiction on the basis of the [Genocide] Con-
      vention, it could only deal with events subsequent to the different
      dates on which the Convention might have become applicable as
      between the Parties. In this regard, the Court will confine itself to the
      observation that the Genocide Convention — and in particular Arti-
      cle IX — does not contain any clause the object or effect of which is
      to limit in such manner the scope of its jurisdiction ratione temporis,
      and nor did the Parties themselves make any reservation to that end,
      either to the Convention or on [a later possible opportunity]. The
      Court thus finds that it has jurisdiction in this case to give effect to
      the Genocide Convention with regard to the relevant facts which
      have occurred since the beginning of the conflict which took place in
      Bosnia and Herzegovina.” (I.C.J. Report 1996 (II), p. 617, para. 34 ;
      emphasis added.)




   Croatia argues that the same reasoning should also be applicable in the
present case, and therefore invites the Court to dismiss the Serbian objec-
tion.
   123. The Court observes however that the temporal questions to be
resolved in the present case are not the same as those dealt with by the
Court in 1996. At that time, the Court had merely to determine, first
whether, at the date that the proceedings in the case were instituted, the
Genocide Convention had become applicable between the FRY and Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, and secondly whether in the exercise of its jurisdic-
tion it was limited to dealing only with events subsequent to the date or
dates on which the Convention might thus have become applicable. That
date was, or those dates were, in any event subsequent to the moment at
which the FRY had come into existence and had thus become capable of
being itself a party to the Convention. Therefore the finding of the Court
that it had jurisdiction “with regard to the relevant facts which have
occurred since the beginning of the conflict” (that is to say not merely
facts subsequent to the date when the Convention became applicable
between the parties) was not addressed to the question whether these
included facts occurring prior to the coming into existence of the FRY.
In the present case, the Court therefore cannot draw from that judgment
(which, as already noted, does not have the authority of res judicata in
the present proceedings) any definitive conclusion as to the temporal
scope of the jurisdiction it has under the Convention. At the same time,
the Court notes, as it did in 1996, that there is no express provision in the
Genocide Convention limiting its jurisdiction ratione temporis.

   124. Another circumstance distinguishing the present case from the
case between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the FRY is that in the present
case Serbia’s objection is presented as relating both to the Court’s juris-
diction and to matters of admissibility of the claims of Croatia. In par-
ticular, the Court notes that, in the present case, the Parties advanced
arguments relating to the consequences to be drawn from the fact that
the FRY only became a State and a party to the Genocide Convention
on 27 April 1992, not only with regard to its jurisdiction but also with
regard to the attribution to Serbia of acts that occurred before that date.
Serbia contended that, not having been a State before 27 April 1992, acts
that occurred before that date cannot be attributed to it and that, not
having been a party to the Convention, it could not have breached any
obligation under it. In the Court’s view the question of the temporal
scope of its jurisdiction is closely bound up with these questions of attri-
bution, presented by Serbia as a matter of admissibility rather than of
jurisdiction, and thus has to be examined in the light of these issues. The
Court therefore now turns to the aspect of the objection related to issues
of attribution of acts that occurred prior to 27 April 1992.
   125. In its Memorial, Croatia referred to the temporal element and
contended that “the fact that the FRY only formally proclaimed itself on
27 April 1992 does not mean that acts occurring prior to that date cannot




be attributed to it”. It invoked what it referred to as a well-established
principle that “a state in statu nascendi is responsible for conduct carried
out by its officials and organs or otherwise under its direction and
control”. Croatia indicated that it relies on the rule stated in Article 10,
paragraph 2, of the International Law Commission’s Articles on the State
Responsibility (Annex to General Assembly resolution 56/83, 12 Decem-
ber 2001, hereinafter referred to as “the ILC Articles on State Responsi-
bility”), that “the conduct of a movement insurrectional or other which
succeeds in establishing a new State shall be considered an act of the new
State under international law”.


   126. In its preliminary objections Serbia contended that “[a]cts or
omissions which took place before the FRY came into existence cannot
possibly be attributed to the FRY” ; it denies that Croatia has been able
to demonstrate that the FRY was a State in statu nascendi, and argues
that that concept is “evidently not appropriate for this case”. At the hear-
ings it argued that the requirements of Article 10, paragraph 2, of the
ILC Articles on State Responsibility are not fulfilled in respect of the
claims made by Croatia against Serbia in the present case. It contended
that Croatia has been unable to specify an identifiable “insurrectional or
other movement” in the territory of the SFRY as one that established the
FRY which would fall within the definition of that Article.

   127. In so far as Article 10, paragraph 2, of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility reflects customary international law on the subject, it
would necessarily require the Court, in order to determine if that rule is
applicable to the present case and for purposes of a possible application,
to enter into an examination of factual issues concerning the events lead-
ing up to the dissolution of the SFRY and the establishment of the FRY.
The Court notes further that for it to determine whether, prior to
27 April 1992, the FRY was a State in statu nascendi for purposes of the
rule invoked would similarly involve enquiry into disputed matters of
fact. It would thus be impossible to determine the questions raised by the
objection without to some degree determining issues properly pertaining
to the merits.
   128. The provision introduced into the Rules of Court in 1972, and
constituting Article 79, paragraph 7, of the Rules adopted on
14 April 1978, was drafted, as the Court indicated in the case concerning
Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicara-
gua v. United States of America), to make it clear that when preliminary
objections are exclusively preliminary, they have to be decided upon
immediately, “but if they are not, especially when the character of the
objections is not exclusively preliminary because they contain both pre-
liminary aspects and other aspects relating to the merits, they will have to
be dealt with at the stage of the merits” (Merits, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1986, p. 31, para. 41 ; see also Questions of Interpretation and




Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial
Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom),
Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports 1998, pp. 27-29.)
   129. In the view of the Court, the questions of jurisdiction and admis-
sibility raised by Serbia’s preliminary objection ratione temporis constitute
two inseparable issues in the present case. The first issue is that of the
Court’s jurisdiction to determine whether breaches of the Genocide Con-
vention were committed in the light of the facts that occurred prior to the
date on which the FRY came into existence as a separate State, capable of
being a party in its own right to the Convention ; this may be regarded as
a question of the applicability of the obligations under the Genocide Con-
vention to the FRY before 27 April 1992. The second issue, that of admis-
sibility of the claim in relation to those facts, and involving questions of
attribution, concerns the consequences to be drawn with regard to the
responsibility of the FRY for those same facts under the general rules of
State responsibility. In order to be in a position to make any findings on
each of these issues, the Court will need to have more elements before it.
   130. In view of the above, the Court concludes that Serbia’s prelimi-
nary objection ratione temporis does not possess, in the circumstances of
the case, an exclusively preliminary character.

VII. PRELIMINARY OBJECTION CONCERNING THE SUBMISSION OF CERTAIN
   PERSONS TO TRIAL ; THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON MISSING
    CROATIAN CITIZENS ; AND THE RETURN OF CULTURAL PROPERTY

   131. Serbia’s preliminary objection as stated in its final submis-
sion 2 (b), (hereinafter referred to as the “third objection”) is that

      “claims referring to submission to trial of certain persons within the
      jurisdiction of Serbia, providing information regarding the where-
      abouts of missing Croatian citizens and return of cultural property
      are beyond the jurisdiction of this Court and inadmissible”.

In the objection as filed on 11 September 2002, it had been asserted that
some of the Applicant’s specific submissions are per se inadmissible and
moot. Serbia has identified the claims in question as those made as sub-
missions 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c) advanced in the Memorial of Croatia.
Despite this overall classification of the objection as being both to the
jurisdiction of the Court and to the admissibility of certain claims, it
appears that not all the contentions of Serbia in this respect are related to
both aspects of the objection.

  132. The Court notes that Croatia has asked the Court simply to reject




the third objection, though in relation to one matter it suggests that the
point should be examined at the merits stage (see paragraphs 138 and 142
below). The Court recalls that it is required by Article 79, paragraph 7, of
the 1978 Rules of Court either to “uphold the objection, reject it, or
declare that the objection does not possess, in the circumstances of the
case, an exclusively preliminary character” ; and that this last course may
be indicated, inter alia, when an objection contains “both preliminary
aspects and other aspects relating to the merits” (Military and Paramili-
tary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of
America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 31, para. 41).


                                    *   *
                     (i) Submission of persons to trial
   133. Submission 2 (a) in the Croatian Memorial requests the Court to
find that Serbia is under an obligation :

      “to take immediate and effective steps to submit to trial before the
      appropriate judicial authority, those citizens or other persons within
      its jurisdiction who are suspected on probable grounds of having
      committed acts of genocide as referred to in paragraph (1) (a), or
      any of the other acts referred to in paragraph (1) (b) [of the Sub-
      missions of Croatia], in particular Slobodan Milošević, the former
      President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to ensure that
      those persons, if convicted, are duly punished for their crimes”.

Croatia’s claim is based on Articles I and VI of the Genocide Conven-
tion. By Article I, the Contracting Parties “undertake to prevent and
punish” genocide ; and Article VI provides that

         “Persons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumer-
      ated in article III shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State
      in the territory of which the act was committed, or by such interna-
      tional penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction with respect to those
      Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its jurisdiction.”

Croatia thus contends that “the failure of the FRY . . . to submit all rele-
vant persons for trial by a competent tribunal gives rise to its interna-
tional responsibility”.
   134. As regards the factual basis of this claim, the Court notes that
Croatia has adjusted its submissions to take account of the fact that
former President Slobodan Milošević had, since the presentation of the
Memorial, been transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and has since died. Furthermore, Croatia




accepts that this submission is now moot in respect of a number of other
persons whom Serbia has transferred to the ICTY, but insists that there
continues to be a dispute between Croatia and Serbia with respect to per-
sons who have not been submitted to trial either in Croatia or before the
ICTY in respect of acts or omissions which are the subject of these pro-
ceedings. As regards the ICTY, Serbia maintains, as a first basis of its
objection, that as a matter of fact there is only one person still at large
who has been accused by the ICTY of crimes allegedly committed in
Croatia, and these accusations relate not to genocide but to war crimes
and crimes against humanity. Croatia observes that a number of persons
have been charged with genocide by the Croatian authorities, and that a
number of perpetrators so charged are out of reach of the Croatian
authorities, “presumably in Serbia”.
   135. The second and third bases of Serbia’s objection to Croatian sub-
mission 2 (a) are as follows. Serbia observes that Croatia is asserting
that Serbia is under an obligation under the Genocide Convention to
punish its nationals for alleged acts of genocide committed in Croatia,
that is to say outside Serbia’s own territory ; it draws attention however
to the finding made by the Court in 2007 (since the proceedings were
instituted in this case) in its Judgment in the case concerning Application
of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), that the
Convention “only obliges the Contracting Parties to institute and exer-
cise territorial criminal jurisdiction” (I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), pp. 226-
227, para. 442). Serbia then objects further that Croatia is apparently
claiming that Serbia has violated the Genocide Convention by failing in a
duty to hand over persons who have allegedly committed acts of geno-
cide, not to the ICTY, but to Croatia itself ; and it argues that no such
obligation is to be found in the Convention ; in this respect, it again cites
the Judgment in the case concerning Application of the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Serbia and Montenegro) (ibid., p. 227, para. 443).

  136. In the view of the Court, these issues are clearly matters of inter-
pretation or application of the Genocide Convention, the role conferred
on the Court by Article IX, and thus, contrary to the contention of Ser-
bia in its objection, within the jurisdiction of the Court (cf. Avena and
Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America), Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), pp. 31-32, para. 30).
  The Court understands the first basis of Serbia’s submission to be
essentially a matter of admissibility : it amounts to an assertion
that, on the facts of the case as they now stand, the claim is moot,
in the sense that Croatia has not shown that there are at the present
time any persons charged with genocide, either by the ICTY or by
the courts of Croatia, who are on the territory or within the control
of Serbia. Whether that is correct will be a matter for the Court to
determine when it examines the claims of Croatia on the merits. The




Court therefore rejects the objection and sees no remaining issue of
admissibility.

        (ii) Provision of information on missing Croatian citizens


   137. By submission 2 (b) advanced by Croatia, which is challenged by
Serbia by its third preliminary objection, the Applicant asks the Court to
find that Serbia is under an obligation
      “to provide forthwith to the Applicant all information within its
      possession or control as to the whereabouts of Croatian citizens who
      are missing as a result of the genocidal acts for which [Serbia] is
      responsible, and generally to co-operate with the authorities of the
      Republic of Croatia to jointly ascertain the whereabouts of the said
      missing persons or their remains”.
Serbia has asserted in support of its objection to this submission that the
relevant acts committed in Croatia do not amount to genocide, so that
the obligations under the Genocide Convention do not apply. It has also
drawn attention to co-operation between the two States concerning the
location and identification of missing persons, both direct and in the con-
text of the work of the International Commission for Missing Persons,
and to the existence of bilateral treaty-instruments concluded by the two
States imposing obligations to exchange data about missing persons.
Croatia contends that these agreements do not preclude the exercise of
the Court’s jurisdiction under Article IX of the Genocide Convention,
and are in practice ineffective.

   138. It does not appear that this submission of Croatia is regarded by
Serbia as “beyond the jurisdiction of this Court” (see paragraph 131
above) ; it has been presented rather as a matter of mootness of the claim,
a question of admissibility. It is not disputed that the Genocide Conven-
tion does not specifically prescribe a duty to provide information of the
kind referred to, but Croatia has contended that its submission “falls
squarely within [the terms of] the Genocide Convention”, and presented
the matter in terms of an appropriate remedy for a continuing breach of
the Convention by Serbia.
   139. However, the question what remedies might appropriately be
ordered by the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article IX of
the Convention is one which is necessarily dependent upon the findings
that the Court may in due course make of breaches of the Convention by
the Respondent. As a matter which is essentially one of the merits, and
one dependent upon the principal question of responsibility raised by the
claim, this is not a matter that may be the proper subject of a preliminary
objection. This conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that, in this




particular case, in order to decide whether an order in the terms of
Croatian submission 2 (b) would be an appropriate remedy, the Court
would have to enquire into disputed matters of fact. This it would have
to do in order to establish whether or not, and in what circumstances, the
co-operation as to the provision of information between the two States
mentioned by Serbia has taken place, and whether this remedy might be
held as resulting from the establishment of responsibility for breaches of
the Convention. These issues are for the merits, and the Court concludes
that the preliminary objection submitted by Serbia, so far as it relates to
Croatian submission 2 (b), must be rejected.

                    (iii) Return of cultural property
   140. By submission 2 (c) advanced by Croatia, which is also chal-
lenged by Serbia by its third preliminary objection, the Applicant asks
the Court to find that Serbia is under an obligation “forthwith to return
to the Applicant any items of cultural property within its jurisdiction or
control which were seized in the course of the genocidal acts for which it
is responsible”. Serbia has argued that in this respect no dispute exists
between the Parties, “even more so since cultural property has to a large
extent already been returned to Croatia by Serbia”, so that the claim has
become “moot and thus inadmissible”. It is less clear whether Serbia also
disputes the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that claim : it does
argue that the acts complained of “must constitute acts of genocide in
order for the Court to be able to exercise jurisdiction under Article IX of
the Convention”, but not that the Court would have no jurisdiction to
consider whether those acts do or do not constitute breaches of the Con-
vention.
   141. As already noted above, since proceedings were instituted in this
case, the Court has given judgment in the case concerning Application of
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) ( I.C.J. Reports
2007 (I), p. 43) ; and Serbia has relied on that decision also in the con-
text of the issue now under examination. In that case the Court found
that there had been a “deliberate destruction of the historical, cultural
and religious heritage of the . . . group [protected by the Convention]”
(ibid., p. 185, para. 344). However, the Court found that “[a]lthough such
destruction may be highly significant inasmuch as it is directed to the
elimination of all traces of the cultural or religious presence of a group,
and contrary to other legal norms, it does not fall within the categories of
acts of genocide set out in Article II of the Convention” (ibid.). As has
already been indicated (see paragraphs 52-56 above), this decision does
not have the force of res judicata in the present proceedings, but the




Court sees no reason to depart from its earlier finding on the general
question of interpretation of the Convention in this respect. The Court
will have to decide how these findings of law are to be applied, and what
may be their effect in the present case.

  142. Croatia however indicates that it perceives the alleged deliberate
destruction and looting of cultural property in this case as part of a
broader plan or pattern of activities aimed at the extinction of an ethnic
group, and therefore within the purview of the Genocide Convention,
and that accordingly an order for return of property taken in such cir-
cumstances is not a priori inadmissible ; it suggests that whether or not
such an order would be an appropriate remedy in this case is a matter to
be determined at the merits stage.

  143. However, as the Court has noted above, the question what rem-
edies might appropriately be ordered by the Court is one which is neces-
sarily dependent upon the findings that the Court may in due course
make of breaches of the Genocide Convention by the Respondent ; it is
not a matter that may be the proper subject of a preliminary objection.
As in the case of submission 2 (b), this conclusion is reinforced by the
consideration that in order to decide whether an order in the terms of
Croatian submission 2 (c) would be an appropriate remedy, the Court
would have to enquire into disputed matters of fact, to establish whether
or not a breach of an obligation deriving from the Genocide Convention
had been established, and if so in what respects. The Court concludes
that the preliminary objection submitted by Serbia so far as it relates to
Croatian submission 2 (c) must be rejected.


                                   *   *
                             (iv) Conclusion
   144. Serbia’s third preliminary objection, as stated in its final submis-
sion 2 (b), addressed to Croatia’s submissions 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c),
must therefore be rejected in its entirety.


                                  * * *
   145. Having established its jurisdiction, the Court will consider the
preliminary objection that it has found to be not of an exclusively pre-
liminary character when it reaches the merits of the case. In accordance
with Article 79, paragraph 7, of the Rules of Court as adopted on
14 April 1978, time-limits for the further proceedings will be fixed subse-
quently by the Court.
