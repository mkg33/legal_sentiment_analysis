Contentions by Respondents that case should be dismissed in limine litis as a
result of Applicant’s changed attitude to Court’s jurisdiction in its Observations.

Whether Applicant’s changed attitude amounts to discontinuance — Appli-
cant expressly denied notice of discontinuance and wants the Court to decide
upon its jurisdiction — Court unable to treat Observations as having legal effect
of discontinuance — Court has power, ex officio, to put an end to a case in
interests of proper administration of justice — Not applicable in present case.

Whether Applicant’s position discloses substantive agreement on jurisdiction
resulting in absence of dispute for purposes of Article 36, paragraph 6, of
Statute — Distinction to be drawn between question of jurisdiction and right
of party to appear before the Court under the Statute — Latter not a matter
of consent — Court must reach its own conclusion.

Court cannot decline to entertain case because of a suggestion as to motives
of one of the parties or because its judgment may have influence in another case.

Whether, in light of Applicant’s contention that it was not party to the Geno-
cide Convention until March 2001, the substantive dispute with the Respondent,

in so far as jurisdiction is founded on that Convention, has disappeared — Con-
tention that Applicant has forfeited right of action and is estopped from pur-
suing the proceedings — No withdrawal of claims as to merits — Applicant
cannot be held to have renounced its rights or to be estopped from continuing the
action.

Questions of jurisdiction — Court’s “freedom to select the ground upon which
it will base its judgment” — Distinction between present proceedings and other
cases — Applicant’s right of access to Court under Article 35, paragraph 1, of
Statute, challenged — If not party to Statute at time of institution of proceed-
ings, subject to application of Article 35, paragraph 2, Applicant had no right to
appear before Court — Court must determine whether Applicant meets condi-
tions laid down in Articles 34 and 35 of Statute before examining conditions in
Article 36 of Statute.

Break-up of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992 — Dec-
laration of 27 April 1992 and Note of same date from Permanent Representa-
tive of Yugoslavia to the United Nations, addressed to Secretary-General —
Security Council resolution 757 of 30 May 1992 — Security Council resolu-
tion 777 of 19 September 1992 — General Assembly resolution 4711 of 22 Sep-
tember 1992 — Legal Counsel’s letter of 29 September 1992 regarding “prac-
tical consequences” of General Assembly resolution 4711 — General Assembly
resolution 47/229 of 29 April 1993.

Complexity and ambiguity of legal position of FRY within and vis-à-vis the
United Nations during the period 1992-2000 — Absence of authoritative deter-
mination by competent United Nations organs.

Reference by Court to “sui generis” position of FRY in Judgment of 3 Feb-
ruary 2003 in Application for Revision case — Term not prescriptive but
merely descriptive of amorphous situation — No conclusion drawn by Court as
to status of FRY vis-a-vis the United Nations in 2003 Judgment nor in inciden-
tal proceedings in other cases including Order on provisional measures in
present case.

FRY's sui generis position came to end with admission to United Nations on
1 November 2000 — Admission did not have effect of dating back — New devel-
opment clarified amorphous legal situation — Situation faced by Court mani-
festly different from that in 1999 — Applicant was not a Member of United
Nations, hence not party to Statute, on 29 April 1999 when it filed Application.

Court not open to Applicant, at date of filing of Application, under Article 35,
paragraph 1, of Statute.

Question whether Court open to Applicant under Article 35, paragraph 2, of
Statute — Contention by certain Respondents that Applicant may not rely on
this text — Appropriate for Court to examine question.

Scope of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Determination by Court in provisional
measures Order of April 1993 in Genocide Convention case that Article IX of
the Genocide Convention “could .. . be regarded prima facie as a special provi-
sion contained in a treaty in force” — Contentions by certain Respondents that
“treaties in force” relates only to treaties in force when Statute came into force.

Natural and ordinary meaning allows two different interpretations: treaties in
force at time when Statute came into force and treaties in force at date of insti-
tution of proceedings — Object and purpose of Article 35 is to define conditions
of access to Court: natural to reserve position in relation to treaties that might
then exist, not to allow States to obtain access to Court by conclusion between
themselves of any special treaty — First interpretation reinforced by examina-
tion of travaux préparatoires — Substantially same provision in PCIJ Statute
intended to refer to special provisions in Peace Treaties concluded after First
World War — No discussion in travaux of ICJ Statute to suggest that exten-
sion of access to Court intended.

Genocide Convention came into force after Statute — Not “treaty in force”
within meaning of Article 35, paragraph 2 — Unnecessary to decide whether
Applicant was party to Genocide Convention on 29 April 1999.

In view of Court’s conclusion of lack of access to Court under either para-
graph 1 or paragraph 2 of Article 35 of Statute, unnecessary for Court to con-
sider Respondents’ other preliminary objections.

Distinction between existence of jurisdiction and compatibility of acts with


LEGALITY OF USE OF FORCE (JUDGMENT) 578

international law — Irrespective of whether Court has jurisdiction, Parties
remain responsible for acts attributable to them that violate the rights of other
States — In present case, having no jurisdiction, Court can make no finding on
such matters.

accordingly constitute a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court
could prima facie be founded in this case” (I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I),
p. 373, para. 28).

48. In the course of the proceedings on these requests in other cases,
however, some of the Respondents raised the issue of whether the Appli-
cant was a party to the Statute of the Court, and contended, for example,
that

“the Court’s jurisdiction in this case cannot in any event be based,
even prima facie, on Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, for
under this provision only ‘States . . . parties to the . . . Statute’ may
subscribe to the optional clause for compulsory jurisdiction con-
tained therein” (Legality of Use of Force ( Yugoslavia v. Belgium),
LC.J. Reports 1999 (I), p. 135, para. 31).


81. On 30 June 1995, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, referring to
Article 79, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, raised preliminary objec-
tions concerning the admissibility of the Application and the jurisdiction
of the Court to entertain the case. The Court, in its Judgment on Pre-
liminary Objections of 11 July 1996, rejected the preliminary objections
raised by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and found inter alia that
“on the basis of Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Pun-
ishment of the Crime of Genocide, it has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon
the dispute” (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 623). The question of the status
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in relation to Article 35 of the
Statute was not raised and the Court saw no reason to examine it.

82. However, in the wake of the new development in the legal status of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 2000 mentioned above (para-
graphs 74-76), the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia filed a new Applica-
tion dated 23 April 2001 instituting proceedings, whereby, referring to
Article 61 of the Statute of the Court, it requested the Court to revise
the above-mentioned Judgment of 11 July 1996. In its Application the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia contended the following:

“The admission of the FRY to the United Nations as a new
Member on 1 November 2000 is certainly a new fact. It can also be
demonstrated, and the Applicant submits, that this new fact is of


THE COURT,

Unanimously,

Finds that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the
Application filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999.
