By the Special Agreement the Court is requested to determine
whether sovereignty over the plots shown in the survey and known
from 1836 to 1843 as Nos. gr and 92, Section A, Zondereygen,
belongs to Belgium or to the Netherlands.

The frontier between the two States in the area where the two
plots in dispute are situated presents certain unusual features.
Whilst the frontier in general is a linear one, in the area north of
the Belgian town of Turnhout there are a number of enclaves
formed by the Belgian commune of Baerle-Duc and the Netherlands
commune of Baarle-Nassau.

The territory of the Belgian commune of Baerle-Duc is not
continuous. It is made up of a series of plots of land, many of which


2I3 SOVEREIGNTY OVER FRONTIER LAND (JUDGMENT 20 VI 59)

are enclosed in the Netherlands commune of Baarle-Nassau. Various
pieces of the commune of Baerle-Duc are not only isolated from
the main territory of Belgium but also one from another. Neither
is the territory of the commune of Baarle-Nassau continuous: that
commune has enclaves within Belgium. The Court is informed that
the origin of this situation is very ancient.

In 1826, when the Netherlands and Belgium were a single
Kingdom, a proposal was made to fix the boundaries between
the two communes. A minute of delimitation, drawn up on
10 September of that year, to which was appended a map, pro-
posed a continuous boundary for Baarle-Nassau, the abolition
of enclaves within its territories and compensation in land. This
proposal was abandoned as it was rejected by the commune of
Baerle-Duc.

In 1836, an attempt was made by the burgomasters of the two
communes to establish the exact boundaries between the two com-
munes in order to secure an equitable allocation of land tax. In
that year, the burgomasters, with their officials, proceeded to
establish as exactly as possible the division that had existed from
the earliest times between the plots of land enclosed within these
communes. They established a Minute which is dated 29 November
1836, but which was not completed until about the middle of 1839.
It was finally signed on 22 March 1841. It is hereinafter referred
to as the “Communal Minute”.

For a considerable time the commune of Baerle-Duc refused to
sign it. In some respects the decisions taken in 1836 left some
doubt and did not satisfy either commune. Considerable effort
appears to have been made to remove mistakes. The Communal
Minute itself provided that any errors therein could be corrected
by common accord. There seems to have been no intention that the
Communal Minute should constitute an immutable document.

The separation of Belgium from the Netherlands was sanctioned
by the Treaty of London of 19 April 1839. Under the terms thereof,


2T4 SOVEREIGNTY OVER FRONTIER LAND (JUDGMENT 20 VI 59)

a Mixed Boundary Commission was set up to fix and determine the
limits of the possessions of the two States.

This Commission was already engaged upon its work at the time
when the Communal Minute was signed in March 1841. Shortly
thereafter, it directed its attention to the situation existing between
the two communes and continued to do so till the end of 1841.
It then discontinued its labours and they were not resumed until
early 1843.

During this interval the two Governments had, on 5 November
1842, signed a Boundary Treaty which entered into force on
5 February 1843. They had considered it necessary to intervene to
settle by their common agreement certain questions relating to the
determination of the frontier. It should here be recalled that on
4 September 1841 the Belgian Government had rejected a proposal
to settle, by means of mutual exchange of territories, the situation
in respect of the communes of Baerle-Duc and Baarle-Nassau, and
had declared in favour of the maintenance of the sfaius quo.

The division of these two communes between the two Kingdoms
is the subject of a special study.

(Article go of the Descriptive Minute.)”

The Descriptive Minute is made up of two parts. The first
determines the procedure used when the demarcation of the
frontier reaches the territory of the communes of Baarle-Nassau
and Baerle-Duc. It reads as follows:

mune of Baerle-Duc. It follows, in its view, that in accordance with
the terms of the Boundary Convention sovereignty over these plots

Alternatively, the Netherlands Government maintains that,

a mere comparison between the terms of the Communal Minute and
the Descriptive Minute establishes this. It states that it is not

ever, of its contention that a mistake did occur, it advances an
hypothesis, as to the origin and consequences of the alleged mistake,
which will be adverted to later.

As a further alternative, the Netherlands Government submits
that, should it be held that the Boundary Convention determined
the sovereignty in respect of the disputed plots and is not vitiated
by mistake, acts of sovereignty exercised by it since 1843 over the

Convention and have established sovereignty in the Netherlands.

The Court will proceed to deal with these three grounds in the
order in which they have been presented by the Netherlands.

the Belgian territory of Baerle-Duc consisted of certain enumerated
plots or parts of plots. Under this enumeration, the disputed plots
were attributed to Baarle-Nassau.

2 December 1841 the examination and verification was continued.
It was decided that the Achel Minute should be an annex to the
minutes of that meeting and that the proposals to be made for
Baarle-Nassau and Baerle-Duc by the Mixed Boundary Commission

“Paragraph 2:

gium)...”


The Mixed Boundary Commission did not take up the matter
again until its 208th meeting, held on 23 February 1843. In the
meantime, the Treaty of 5 November 1842 had been ratified.

Up to this point of time, the following conclusions emerge from
a perusal of the Minutes:

From 4 September 1841, the work of delimitation proceeded on

it was not possible to establish any regular and exact delimitation
of boundaries between the Netherlands and Belgium. Methods and
types of operation differing from those pursued in respect of the
rest of the frontier line had to be adopted to delineate the bound- '

States. These methods and types of operation consisted of recog-
nizing and designating the plots which belonged to the Netherlands
on the one hand and Belgium on the other. For these purposes
a survey was used. The Mixed Boundary Commission carefully

of its labours.

When the work of delimitation of boundaries was resumed by the

1843, it took note of the Treaty of 5 November 1842. Since the
Commission had, from 4 September 1841 onwards, based its
labours on the maintenance of the status quo and since the said
Treaty did not modify this position, it was agreed that the work

At the 209th meeting held on 3 March 1843, it was decided that
the Presidents of the respective Boundary Commissions should

Treaty of 5 November 1842 and that the Descriptive Minute should
be revised and completed by one of several sub-commissions, which
should submit the result of its work for the approval of the Com-


The minutes of the 211th meeting of the Mixed Boundary Com-
mission held on 9 March 1843 indicate that it met to consider the
course which should be followed regarding the villages of Baarle-



Nassau and Baerle-Duc, and that after discussion it was decided
that:

(1) The boundary of the communes should not be described, the
regular description of the boundary line should stop at a certain
point and be resumed again at a certain point; and

vention should include one or several articles referring, by their
numbers and section in the Survey, to all the plots of which the
sovereignty belongs to one State or the other, in conformity with
the minute of the 176th meeting.

The problem of the separation of the two communes had been
in the hands of a sub-commission. At its 220th meeting held on
27 March 1843, the Mixed Boundary Commission had before it a
draft proposed by that sub-commission. The discussion was to be

disputed plots to the Netherlands. It adopted the text of an article

Thereby it attributed the disputed plots to Belgium.

The Mixed Boundary Commission did not confine itself to a mere
reference to Article 14 of the Treaty of 5 November 1842 and to

as disclosed in the minutes, it appears that the Commission went
much further and proceeded to delimit the boundaries between
the two States in respect of the two Baarles in the only way which
was open to it.

In fact this was what the Commission had been doing from
4 September 1841 when Belgium declared in favour of the main-
tenance of the status quo, as appears clearly from the letter from
the President of the Netherlands Commission of 16 December 1841




[Translation]

the two communes was, in the view of the Court, beyond question.
It follows from Article 6 of the Treaty between the Netherlands and
Belgium concluded at London on 19 April 1839, which provides:

each of the two Parties renounces reciprocally and for ever, all
pretension to the Territories, Towns, Fortresses, and Places, situated
within the limits of the possessions of the other Party, as those
limits are described in Articles 1, 2 and 4.

The said limits shall be marked out in conformity with those
Articles, by Belgian and Dutch Commissioners of Demarcation,
who shall meet as soon as possible in the town of Maestricht.”

of the frontier between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
Kingdom of Belgium, have for this purpose, and in conformity
with Article 6 of the said Treaty, appointed as their commissioners
the following: … [the names of the Commissioners appointed follow].”

This statement represents the common intention of the two
States. Any interpretation under which the Boundary Convention
is regarded as leaving in suspense and abandoning for a subsequent
appreciation of the status quo the determination of the right of one



State or the other to the disputed plots would be incompatible
with that common intention.

The Court reaches the conclusion that the Boundary Convention
was intended to determine, and did determine, as between the two
States, to which State the various plots in each commune belonged.
Under its terms, the disputed plots were determined to belong to

that there was not a “word for word” transcription of the former,

follows that there was a mistake and that that mistake vitiates the
Convention in this respect.

To succeed on the basis of the alleged mistake, the Netherlands
must establish that the intention of the Mixed Boundary Com-
mission was that the Descriptive Minute attached to and forming

and that this intention was defeated by the transcription in the
Descriptive Minute of a different text, which, contrary to the text

The duty of the Mixed Boundary Commission was to determine

Netherlands Commission to the Netherlands Minister for Foreign

was different from the attribution made in the Achel Minute and
there can be little doubt that the reason was that the copy of the
Communal Minute then in the possession of the President of the


Netherlands Commission attributed these plots to Baerle-Duc and
that in his report he followed the text of that copy.

two copies of the Communal Minute held by the Netherlands and
Belgian Commissions were at variance on the attribution of the
disputed plots to the two communes. There is no satisfactory
explanation how a text—which according to the copy of the Com-

graph reading “plots numbers 78 to III inclusive belong to the com-
mune of Baarle-Nassau”’—could have by mistake been broken up into
three separate paragraphs giving a different attribution to the dis-
puted plots.

The President of the Netherlands Commission had received a
copy of the Communal Minute which had not then been signed.
It was described by him in his letter to the Governor of North
Brabant of 16 March 1841 as “a most important document’.

Minute had been signed a few days before. To the copy which had
been sent to him he at once added the names of the signatories,
and it was ‘‘signed and stamped as being authentic by the munici-
pality of Baarle-Nassau”. (Letter of 5 April 1841 from the President

with plots 78 to go, 91 and 92, and 93 to III as they appear in the

It suggests that the commune of Baarle-Nassau, when certifying
it as an authentic copy, could not suppose that an error had already
crept into it. A further collating of the two documents would, it
was urged by the Netherlands, have entailed a great deal of work.

To explain how the Netherlands Commission’s authenticated copy
was in the same terms as those used in the Descriptive Minute, the
Netherlands advances the following hypothesis. The Controller of
the Survey at Bois-le-Duc (Netherlands) made a mistake in 1840

that a renumbering of plots had taken place in the Netherlands
survey, and altered a copy of the Communal Minute which copy
or a copy of it subsequently found its way to the Netherlands
Commission. In that copy the disputed plots were attributed, by

The material placed before the Court in support of this hypothesis
fails to establish it; nor does it appear to the Court that the




The Netherlands contends however that it need not establish

copy of the Communal Minute produced by it and that appearing
in the Descriptive Minute reveals sufficiently that a mistake
occurred. The matter is not, however, capable of being disposed of
on this narrow ground. The Court must ascertain the intention of

circumstances.

As of April 1843, the position was as follows: Since October 1841,
both Commissions were in possession of copies of the Communal

disputed plots. This difference was known to the two Commissions
and must have been a subject of discussion between them in 1841.
The divergence between their copies could hardly have been over-
looked in April 1843 by the two Commissions and by their respect-

to fix the boundaries between the two States on that basis. It was

clear from his letter of 31 October 1841 to the Minister of Foreign
Affairs and as stated in the Descriptive Minute, attributed the
disputed plots to Belgium.

In the detailed map which was drawn up pursuant to the decision
of the Mixed Boundary Commission at its 225th Meeting and which
was to become part of the Boundary Convention, it was shown
clearly, and in a manner which could not escape notice, that the

legend of the map, that they did not belong to the Netherlands but
to Belgium. The situation of those plots must have immediately
arrested attention. This map, signed by the members of the res-



pective Commissions, of its very nature must have been the subject
of check by both Commissions against original documents and


It is difficult to accept the view that an error was made in the
Descriptive Minute in the process of copying. The difficulty in the
way of the Court accepting such a view as a practical possibility

put forward by it in its pleadings, it accordingly presented the argu-
ment that there was an error in the copy of the Minute in the hands
of the Netherlands Commission which had automatically repeated
itself, both in the word for word transcription of the Communal

without the error being discovered by the Mixed Boundary Com-
mission. The Descriptive Minute, it was argued, could never have
been checked, except perhaps against the allegedly incorrect Nether-
lands copy.

This explanation fails to have regard to the true function of the
Mixed Boundary Commission and to the facts as they appeared to
it. The Commission was not a mere copvist. Its duty was to ascer-
tain what the status quo was. It had authority to fix the limits

Between the 175th and 225th meetings the Commission, by enquiries

ings and attributed sovereignty over the disputed plots to Belgium.
This decision found its expression in the Boundary Convention.

In the view of the Court, apart from a mere comparison of the

Minute produced by the Netherlands, all attempts to establish and
to explain the alleged mistake are based upon hypotheses which are
not plausible and which are not accompanied by adequate proof.


The Boundary Convention of 1843 was the result of several years
of labour, with members of the Mixed Boundary Commission not
only in contact with the respective communal administrations but

to information furnished to the Court, copies ôf the text of the
Communal Minute to be incorporated in the Descriptive Minute,
and which was in fact incorporated therein, were signed by the
secretaries of each commune. The actual text transcribed was accord-

was confirmed by the Parliament of each State and ratified in accord-
ance with their constitutional processes. Its terms have been
published in each State. For almost a century the Netherlands made
no challenge to the attribution of the disputed plots to Belgium.

The Court is satisfied that no case of mistake has been made out
and that the validity and binding force of the provisions of the
Convention of 1843 in respect of the disputed plots are not affected
on that account.

The final contention of the Netherlands is that if sovereignty over

Convention, acts of sovereignty exercised by the Netherlands since
1843 have established sovereignty in the Netherlands.

This is a claim to sovereignty in derogation of title established

Belgium. The question for the Court is whether Belgium has lost
its sovereignty, by non-assertion of its rights and by acquiescence
in acts of sovereignty alleged to have been exercised by the
Netherlands at different times since 1843.

As to the question whether Belgium ever relinquished its sover-
eignty over the disputed plots, it is to be observed that Belgian
military staff maps since their first publication in 1874 have shown
these plots as Belgian territory. The plots were included in Belgian

was struck out but restored about 1890, since which time both have
continued to appear therein. Transfer deeds relating to one of the
plots were entered in the Records of the Survey authorities at
Baerle-Duc in 1896 and 1904.

In 1843, the plots were uncultivated land, of which one was
described by the Netherlands as being in 1860-1863 ‘a clearing of
heathland”. The Netherlands state that since 1866 the use to
which both plots have been put has changed a number of times,

Prior to 1906 some transfers of land were recorded in the Office

in that Office. Since that time also, registrations of births,
deaths and marriages of inhabitants of these houses have been

and that plots 91 and 92 belonged to the Netherlands. Since then,
sovereignty over these two plots has been the subject of dispute

“ between the two States.

The Netherlands relies, in addition to the incorporation of the
plots in the Netherlands survey, the entry in its registers of land

in the communal register of Baarle-Nassau, on the fact that it has
collected Netherlands land tax on the two plots without any resist-
ance or protest on the part of Belgium.

collected; that neither plot was under Belgian law liable to its
land tax, since both plots were until recent years uncultivated
and one of them was State property. This explanation is disputed
by the Netherlands Government.

Reliance is also placed by the Netherlands upon certain proceed-
ings taken by the commune of Baerle-Duc before a Breda tribunal
in 1851. These proceedings were concerned with a proposed sale of a
large area of heathland over which the commune of Baerle-Duc



claimed to have certain rights of usufruct. This area included part
of the disputed plots.

A further act relied upon by the Netherlands is the sale by the
Netherlands State, publicly announced in the year 1853, of the
heathland above referred to. The Belgian Government states that
the fact that this area included a part of the disputed plots escaped


The Netherlands also claims that Netherlands laws, more par-
ticularly in regard to rents, were applied to houses built on the
plots.

Finally, the Netherlands places reliance upon the grant of a
railway concession which related to a length of line, a small portion
of which passed through the disputed plots.

system of intermingled enclaves which existed. The difficulties
confronting Belgium in detecting encroachments upon, and in
exercising, its sovereignty over these two plots, surrounded as they

are largely of a routine and administrative character performed by
local officials and a consequence of the inclusion by the Netherlands
of the disputed plots in its Survey, contrary to the Boundary Con-

two States in 1892, but which was never ratified. Under the terms

and it had allowed itself to be misled by the text of the Descriptive
Minute and the significance of any cession was not the subject of

The unratified Convention of 1892 did not, of course, create any
legal rights or obligations, but the terms of the Convention itself
and the contemporaneous events show that Belgium at that time
was asserting its sovereignty over the two plots, and that the Nether-

gian Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed the Netherlands
Minister in Brussels that an enclave, intersected by the railway from
Turnhout to Tilburg, had been omitted from the list of territories

Judge Sir Hersch LAUTERPACHT makes the following Declaration:

I have voted in favour of a decision determining that the sover-
eignty over the plots in dispute belongs to the Netherlands.

Article go of the Descriptive Minute of the Boundary Convention
of 1843, in assigning these plots to Belgium, purports to transcribe
word for word the Communal Minute between Baerle-Duc and
Baarle-Nassau which assigns these plots to the Netherlands. The
Netherlands has produced before the Court what it described as
one of the two original copies of the latter Minute. No other copy
of the original Minute has been produced before the Court. The
authenticity of the Minute produced by the Netherlands has not



been challenged—though it has been alleged by Belgium that a
mistake had occurred in the course of transcribing it. On the other
hand, it has been alleged by the Netherlands that a mistake, in
the contrary direction, had occurred in the process of transcribing
that document when the Descriptive Minute was adopted in 1843.
In the words of Counsel for Belgium, the accumulation of errors
in this case was such ‘’as though some evil genius had presided
over the whole affair”. I have formed the view that the evidence
submitted to the Court in the shape of the formal Minutes, succinct
in the extreme, of the Boundary Commission and of fragmentary
correspondence lacking in sequence has not wholly dispelled the
impact of the confused situation thus created. The circumstances
of the adoption, in 1843, of the Descriptive Minute must, to some
extent, be in the nature of conjecture. In particular, it has not
been proved possible to state a direct conclusion as to the authen-
ticity or otherwise of the cardinal piece of evidence, namely, of the
only existing copy of the Communal Minute produced by the
Netherlands. Moreover, while the Commissioners who drafted the
Descriptive Minute enjoyed wide powers, they had no power to
endow with legal efficacy a document in which they purported to
transcribe word for word the Communal Minute and to observe
the status quo but in which they actually modified the Communal
Minute and departed from the status quo. The law knows of no such
power. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the relevant
provisions of the Convention must be considered as void and
inapplicable on account of uncertainty and unresolved discrepancy.

The Special Agreement of 26 November, 1957, submitting the
dispute to the Court is by design so phrased as not to confine its
function to giving a decision based exclusively on the Convention
of 1843. By the generality of its terms it leaves it open to the Court
to determine the question of sovereignty by reference to all relevant
considerations—whether based on the Convention or not. Accord-
ingly, in the circumstances, it seems proper that a decision be ren-
dered by reference to the fact, which is not disputed, that at least
during the fifty years following the adoption of the Convention
there had been no challenge to the exercise, by the Government
of the Netherlands and its officials, of normal administrative author-
ity with regard to the plots in question. In my opinion, there is no
room here for applying the exacting rules of prescription in relation
to a title acquired by a clear and unequivocal treaty; there is no
such treaty. It has been contended that the uninterrupted adminis-
trative activity of the Netherlands was due not to any recognition
of Netherlands sovereignty on the part of Belgium but to the fact
that the plots in question are an enclave within Netherlands terri-
tory and that, therefore, it was natural that Netherlands adminis-



trative acts should have been performed there in the ordinary
course of affairs. However, the fact that local conditions have
necessitated the normal and unchallenged exercise of Netherlands
administrative activity provides an additional reason why, in the
absence of clear provisions of a treaty, there is no necessity to
disturb the existing state of affairs and to perpetuate a geographical
anomaly.

Judge SPIROPOULOS makes the following Declaration:

The international legal status of the disputed plots seems to me
to be extremely doubtful.

The facts and circumstances (decisions of the Mixed Boundary
Commission, letters, etc.) at the basis of the Belgian hypothesis
that the copy, which has not been produced before the Court, of
the Communal Minute of 1841 attributed the disputed plots to
Belgium or that the Boundary Commissioners had corrected it to
that effect—which facts go back more than a century—do not, in
my opinion, make it possible to conclude with sufficient certainty
that the Belgian hypothesis corresponds with the facts.

On the other hand, the thesis of the Netherlands to the effect
that an error crept into the Minute attached to Article go of the
Descriptive Minute of 1843 is also merely based on a hypothesis,
i.e. on the mere fact that the text of the Communal Minute of
1841 departs from the text of the Minute attached to Article go of
the Descriptive Minute of 1843.

Faced as I am with a choice between two hypotheses which lead
to opposite results with regard to the question to whom sovereignty
over the disputed plots belongs, I consider that preference ought
to be given to the hypothesis which seems to me to be the less
speculative and that, in my view, is the hypothesis of the Nether-
lands. For this reason I have hesitated to concur in the Judgment
of the Court.
