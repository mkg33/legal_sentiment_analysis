1. The Court, notwithstanding the unusually large request of Cam-
eroon’s Applications has comprehensively dealt with all the submissions
presented to it by the Parties. However, I am compelled to write this dis-
senting opinion because it is difficult for me to agree with some of the
Court’s decisions. There are five main sectors involved in this case, Lake
Chad, the land boundary, Bakassi Peninsula, maritime delimitation and
the issue of State responsibility. I have no difficulty in accepting and
voting in favour of the Court’s decision on State responsibility (although
my separate view on this will be stated later), some aspects of the maritime
delimitation and land boundary. My dissenting opinion will therefore
centre on the Court’s decision as regards the issue of sovereignty over the
Bakassi Peninsula and the delimitation of Lake Chad. But before dealing
with these points, I intend to touch upon certain issues regarding the
genesis of the case, the function of the Court and some general observa-
tions about the Judgment.

4. At the same time, the Court must constantly remind itself of its
position and obligations as a principal organ of the United Nations
(Art. 7, para. 1, of the Charter). The Court must therefore ensure that it
has a cardinal duty to encourage, by its judgments, all member States of
the United Nations to “refrain in their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political inde-
pendence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Pur-
poses of the United Nations (Art. 2, para. 4, of the Charter). The para-
mount obligation of the Court is to give a decision that will do justice in
accordance with the maintenance of international peace and security in
any region of the world. The Court is constantly aware of this obligation,
for example, the Court took cognisance of resolutions 731 (1992), and
748 (1992) of the Security Council, in the cases of the Questions of Inter-
pretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from
the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United
Kingdom) (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States), when it refused
to order the interim measure requested by Libya. Indeed, in the present
case, at the interim measures stage, the Court ordered that “[bJoth Parties
should lend every assistance to the fact-finding mission which the Secre-
tary-General of the United Nations has proposed to send to the Bakassi
Peninsula” (1. C.J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 25). In performing this exercise it
is part of the duty of the Court, in its application of international law, to
ensure that conflicting considerations are balanced between opposing
claims.

5. An aspect of the Award of Judge Max Huber in the Island of
Palmas case of October 1924 threw some light on such conflicting
interests:

“It is accepted that every law aims at assuring the coexistence of
interests deserving of legal protection. That is undoubtedly true also
of international law. The conflicting interests in this case, in connec-
tion with the question of indemnification of aliens, are, on the one
hand, the interest of the State in the exercise of authority in its own
territory without interference or supervision by foreign States, and,
on the other hand, the interest of the State in seeing the rights of its
nationals in a foreign country respected and effectively protected.”
(H. Lauterpacht, The Function of Law in International Community,
p. 121.)

6. The balancing of conflicting interests in a very sensitive case of this
nature is not strange to the Court and this has reflected in some of its
recent judgments, like the case concerning Maritime Delimitation in the
Area between Greenland and Jan Mayen (Denmark v. Norway) (I.C.J.
Reports 1993, p. 38), where equity played a major role to allow for a fair
and just allocation and delimitation of the maritime boundary; the case
concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between
Qatar and Bahrain (I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 40), a case decided in such a
manner as to ensure peace and stability between both parties, to the
extent that both felt satisfied with the Judgment of the Court; the
KasikililSedudu Island (BotswanalNamibia) case (LCJ Reports
1999 (II), p. 1045), which encouraged both parties to settle their disputes
amicably.

7. In matters of land and maritime boundaries such balancing of con-
flicting interests or adjustment in cases involving different legal or con-
ventional titles cannot be considered as non-judicial. As will be men-
tioned later, these are cases where effectivités or historical consolidation
have been given consideration over and above legal title. Some examples
were given by A. L. W. Munkman in her article:

“It is perhaps necessary to consider at this point the view that
arbitrators dispose of wider powers of adjustment or minor legisla-
tion, a greater discretion in taking account of the ‘equities’ of the
particular situation, than do strictly judicial tribunals, that is, perma-
nent courts. There seems to be no real basis for any suggestion that
the scope of considerations which judicial, as opposed to arbitral,
tribunals may take account of is narrower: a wide range of social,
economic and geographical criteria were explicitly taken account
of in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries and North Sea Continental
Shelf cases, and historical and cultural considerations were not of
themselves described as irrelevant in the Temple case. In the Jawor-
zina case, the Permanent Court explicitly invoked the notion of the
historic boundaries of the States in dispute, and the ethnographical
factors presuming in their favour.” (“Adjudication and Adjust-
ment — International Judicial Decision and the Settlement of Ter-
ritorial and Boundary Disputes”, British Year Book of International
Law, 1972-1973, p. 113.)

8. There are other cases decided by the Court or its predecessor, the
Permanent Court of International Justice, that may also be mentioned,
which lend credence to the fact that international permanent courts are
determined to ensure that at the end of the day both parties to such dis-
putes are happy about the decision and that it is not a case of giving judg-
ment in favour of any of the parties considered to be the “title-holder”.
Recently, the Eritrea/Ethiopia Boundary Commission gave its decision in



the land boundary dispute which has for many years been the cause of
serious armed conflict between the two parties. On 14 April 2002, when
the decision was delivered, both parties returned to their respective
capitals rejoicing that they were satisfied with the decision of the Com-
mission.

9. Munkman went further to enumerate some other cases:

“In the British Guiana Boundary cases decisions on ‘allocation’ of
substantial portions of territory and on the ‘delimitation’ of the
boundary between the areas awarded to each party were com-
bined — as also in the Rann of Kutch award. In the Jaworzina
Boundary case, the Permanent Court in effect gave a decision on the
allocation and delimitation of a boundary on the basis of the status
quo ante. The North Atlantic Fisheries and Gulf of Fonseca cases (in
so far as they related to bays) and the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries
case involved decisions on the allocation of sea areas and their
delimitation and, in the latter case, the technical problem of base-
line demarcation.” (Op. cit., p. 115.)

11. As regards the Lake Chad Basin, I voted against the decisions of
the Court as stated in paragraph 325 I (A) and (B) of the Judgment,
because they fail to take into consideration the submissions of Nigeria
based on effectivités and historical consolidation; hence my decision to
write a dissenting opinion. Admittedly, the Thompson-Marchand Decla-

12. The Court, in reaching its decision on Lake Chad, relied very
heavily or perhaps solely on certain instruments that formed the bedrock
of Cameroon’s case. These instruments are:

— the Milner-Simon Declaration of 10 July 1919, with the annexed
Moisel map;

— the Thompson-Marchand Declaration of 1929-1930, as confirmed by
the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of Notes of 9 January 1931 (para-
graphs 50 and 58 of the Judgment);

— the LCBC Reports and the agreements emanating from them.

13. The Court, in its Judgment, rejects Nigeria’s claim to the 33 vil-
lages in Lake Chad which is based on effectivités. The Court examines
and relies on the Moisel map annexed to the Milner-Simon Declaration
of 1919 and the map attached the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of
Notes of 9 January 1931. It concludes that the co-ordinates of the
tripoint must be 14°04’ 5979999 longitude cast, rather than at approxi-
mately 14° 05° longitude east, thus virtually reaching the same conclu-
sions as the LCBC (para. 57 of the Judgment) . On the question of the
location of the mouth of the Ebeji, the Court decides (paras. 58-60 of the
Judgment) that it is located where the river bifurcates into two branches,
with the geographical co-ordinates of 14° 12°03” longitude east and
12°13’ 17” latitude north. However, the Court rejects the claim of Nigeria
based on the historical consolidation of its title (para. 62 of the Judg-
ment). Apparently, the Court rejects the contention of Cameroon that
the proposals of the LCBC as regards the tripoint and the location of
the mouth of the Ebeji constitutes an authoritative interpretation of the
Milner-Simon Declaration of 10 July 1919 and the Thompson-Marchand
Declaration of 1929-1930, as confirmed by the Exchange of Letters of
9 January 1931. Yet, it appears to me that the ultimate conclusion
reached by the Court amounts to a difference without distinction because
the Court, in finding the co-ordinates of the tripoint, reaches virtually the
same conclusions as the LCBC having taken into consideration the same
Moisel map and the Thompson-Marchand Declaration of 1929-1930, as
confirmed by the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of Notes of 9 January
1931. This opinion therefore touches on all these instruments, the LCBC
Report and agreements emanating therefrom, as well as the issue of effec-
tivités and historical consolidation.

14. In its Additional Application to the Court, dated 6 June 1994,
Cameroon asked the Court to confirm Cameroonian sovereignty over the



disputed parcel in the area of Lake Chad. Cameroon failed to describe
with certainty what it described as the disputed area in the Lake Chad
region. However, in its submission, the claim was further amplified in
that it is seeking for sovereignty over the area of Lake Chad and, in par-
ticular, over Darak. In addition, Cameroon claims more specifically:

“that the land boundary . . . takes the following course:

— from the point at longitude 14°04’ 599999 E of Greenwich and
latitude 13°05” 00” 0001 N, it then runs through the point located
at longitude 14° 12’11”7005E and latitude 12°32"174013N
(Reply of Cameroon, Vol. I, p. 591, para. 13.01). [Translations
by the Registry. }

15. The nature of the dispute can partly be gleaned from the pleadings
of Cameroon:

“The instrument of conventional delimitation is not in dispute.
That instrument is the Exchange of Notes between Henderson and
de Fleuriau of 9 January 1931 . . ., the validity of which is recognized
by Nigeria, even if it disputes its applicability to Lake Chad . ..”
(Ibid., p. 101, para. 3.04.)

And that:
“Initially, the boundary was delimited by the Milner-Simon
Declaration of 10 July 1919 . . . However, this delimitation, while

undergoing no change in relation to Lake Chad, was rendered more
precise in 1931 by the two governments concerned, on the basis of a
survey conducted by the two High Commissioners, the results of
which are set out in the Thompson-Marchand Declaration of
29 December 1929 and 3 January 1930. . .” (Zhid., p. 102, para. 3.05.)

16. The position of Nigeria is reflected in its pleadings as follows:

“The purpose of the present Chapter is to demonstrate that there
has been no final determination of the boundary within Lake Chad
between Nigeria and Cameroon. This demonstration involves the
following elements:

First: the colonial boundary agreements of the period 1906 to 1931
did not produce a conclusive delimitation in the Lake Chad region.

Second. the uncertainties remained after the Independence of Nigeria
and Cameroon.

Third: the work of the Lake Chad Basin Commission did not
produce delimitation, which was final and binding on Nigeria.”
(Counter-Memorial of Nigeria, Vol. II, p. 379, para. 16.1.)

the boundary in Lake Chad. In addition, Nigeria concludes that

“Thus, as at 1 June 1961, the date upon which Northern Came-
roons was incorporated into the independent Federation of Nigeria,
the process of delimitation and demarcation of the boundary in
Lake Chad was still at an embryonic stage.” (Ibid., Vol. II, p. 376,
para. 15.99.)

Cameroon partially or tacitly agrees with this conclusion of Nigeria by
responding that:

“The observation [of Nigeria] is partially correct, concerning the
demarcation of the lake boundary, since Nigeria has not formally
accepted the result of the works carried out within the framework of
the LCBC. It is without foundation for the delimitation, which was
effected with satisfactory precision by the Exchange of Notes
of 9 January 1931, in a manner which was not in the least

>>

‘embryonic’.” (Reply of Cameroon, Vol. I, p. 103, para. 3.11.)

19. Unfortunately, all the attempts made to effect a delimitation and
demarcation of the boundary in the Lake Chad area failed. Before World
War I, all the correspondence, notes, declarations and agreements entered
into between Great Britain and Germany failed to achieve the purpose
of delimitation. Similarly, all the attempts made between France and
Great Britain after World War 1 equally failed. Subsequent attempts
made at the beginning of World War II did not achieve the purpose of
delimiting the boundary, let alone demarcating it. The following are the
attempts:

20. If we leave for the moment the two crucial Declarations of 1919
and 1931, which failed to delimit the boundary, all subsequent attempts
to effect the delimitation from 1931 to 1938 equally failed. Even by that
time, the Boundary Commission, under the Permanent Mandates Com-
mission did not make any tangible progress to effect the proposed task of
demarcation. Based on the preliminary study of the boundary that they
had provisionally defined, it was in 1937 that the Joint Commission
started its work. However, the outbreak of World War II put a halt to
the Commissions work. A report of 15 January 1942, communicated to
the Colonial Office by the Governor of Nigeria indicated that the com-
missioners had executed only 135 miles of the boundary out of a total
length of approximately 1,200 miles (ibid., Vol. IX, Ann. 371).



21. Going back to the 1919 Milner-Simon Declaration, it is described
as an agreement

“to determine the frontier, separating the territories of the Cam-
eroons placed respectively under the authority of their Govern-
ments, as it is traced on the map Moisel 1:300,000, annexed to the
present declaration and defined in the description in three articles
also annexed hereto” (Counter-Memorial of Nigeria, Vol. V, Ann. 50,


That boundary as described by the Milner-Simon Declaration is patently
inaccurate, unreliable and deficient. It is admitted by both Parties that
the Moisel map attached to the Declaration is unreliable, even as regards
the co-ordinates (i.e., latitude 13° 05’ N and longitude 14° 05’ E), which
was only drawn to approximation. In some aspects, the Agreement itself
is vague. It is no surprise that the Declaration anticipates “further local
delimitation”. Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Declaration reads thus:

“Tt is understood that at the time of the local delimitation of the
frontier, where the natural features to be followed are not indicated
in the above description, the Commissioners of the two Governments
will, as far as possible, but without changing the attribution of the
villages named in Article 1, lay down the frontier in accordance with
natural features (rivers, hills or watersheds).

The Boundary Commissioners shall be authorised to make such
minor modifications of the frontier line as may appear to them
necessary in order to avoid separating the villages from their agri-
cultural lands. Such deviations shall be clearly marked on special
maps and submitted for the approval of the two Governments.
Pending such approval, the deviations shall be provisionally recog-
nised and respected.” (Ibid, Vol. V, Ann. 50, p. 483; emphasis
added.)

22. In fact, with regard to this Declaration, the letter of Lord Curzon,
in its first paragraph, indicates that Great Britain only agreed with the
French Government as “provisional entry into force pending the definitive
settlement of the régime to be applied in these territories” (ibid., Vol. TX,
Ann. 239, p. 1865; emphasis added). Hence, by 27 May 1921, a sugges-
tion was made by France to Great Britain, that it was preferable to leave
the delimitation until after the mandates have been obtained from the
League of Nations. The letter of the British Ambassador of 23 October
1921, in its second paragraph, gave a very clear indication of the prob-
lems with the Milner-Simon Declaration. In that letter, he suggested that
Article 1 of the Draft Mandate should be recast to contain the following
provision:

“This line may, however, be slightly altered by agreement between



His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Government of the
French Republic where an examination of the localities shows that it
is undesirable, either in the interests of the inhabitants or by reason
of any inaccuracies in the map ( Moisel 1:300,000) annexed to the
declaration to adhere strictly to the line laid down therein.)” (Counter-
Memorial of Nigeria, Vol. IX, Ann. 243, p. 1881; emphasis added.)

referred to above, was accepted by the League of Nations in July 1922, in
order to effect the necessary amendments to the Milner-Simon Declara-
tion. There again, in Article 1 of the League of Nations instrument, the
interest of the inhabitants was to be taken into consideration as well as
correcting the inaccuracies of the Moisel map of 1:300,000 scale, which
incidentally is relatively too small for boundary delimitation exercises.
The important point in all this 1s that the Court fails to give considera-
tion to the interests of the Nigerian inhabitants in all 33 villages claimed
by Nigeria in this sector of Lake Chad.

It can therefore be observed that even during the Mandate there is a
tacit consideration given to effectivités in terms of the interest of the
inhabitants in any of the localities where this is desirable.

24. The Thompson-Marchand Declaration was an improvement on
the Milner-Simon Declaration because it introduced an improved map
that was annexed to that Declaration. Furthermore, it mentioned the
identification of a straight line as far as the mouth of the Ebeji. Here
again, we find that the process had not yet reached the delimitation stage,
let alone demarcation. In the same paragraph of the letter of de Fleuriau
of 9 January 1931, he remarked:

“Your Excellency will no doubt have received the text of same
Declaration and will certainly have observed that it concerns a

be followed by the Delimitation Commission, more exactly than
was done in the Milner-Simon Declaration of 1919.” (fbid., Vol. V,
Ann. 54, p. 538; emphasis added.)

In reply to de Fleuriau’s letter, Arthur Henderson correspondingly replied
that a boundary commission would have to be constituted in order to
take over a preliminary survey that had been conducted in order to carry
out actual delimitation of the boundary.

25. Under the United Nations Trusteeship in 1946, attempts were also
made at delimiting the boundary in Lake Chad, which did not materialize
up to 1948, and after. The report presented by the United Kingdom
Trusteeship for the Cameroons touched on the boundary issues vis-à-vis
the Thompson-Marchand Declaration and states as follows:

“The Territory to which this Agreement applies comprises that
part of the Cameroons lying to the west of the boundary defined by



the Franco-British Declaration of 10 July 1919, and more exactly
defined in the Declaration made by the Governor of the Colony and
Protectorate of Nigeria and the Governor of the Cameroons under
French mandate which was confirmed by the exchange of Notes

French Government of 9 January 1931. This line may, however be
slightly modified by mutual agreement between His Majesty's Gov-
ernment in the United Kingdom and the Government of the French
Republic where an examination of the localities shows that it is desir-
able in the interest of the inhabitants.” (Counter-Memorial of
Nigeria, Vol. V, Ann. 56, pp. 579-581; emphasis added.)

26. One remarkably persistent issue that kept recurring in many of the
agreements just mentioned is the interest of the inhabitants, whenever
delimitation or even demarcation had to be effected. Unfortunately, this
modification has not been carried out till today. It started with the British
Ambassador in 1921; was engrafted into the League of Nations instru-
ments as Article 1; and was again contained in Article 1 in the Trustee-
ship Agreement of 13 December 1946, all clearly expressing the need to
modify the boundary by “mutual agreement between His Majesty's Gov-
ernment in the United Kingdom and the Government of the French
Republic where an examination of the localities shows that it is desirable
in the interest of the inhabitants” (ibid, Ann. 56, p. 581).

27. Has this modification ever been carried out? Can that problem be
ignored or dismissed, especially now that Nigeria is claiming 33 villages
in Lake Chad? In any attempt to delimit this area of the boundary in the
Lake Chad area, should this not be taken into consideration? Yet the
Court fails to consider this claim of Nigeria regarding its inhabitants in


28. In effect therefore, the judicial assignment of the Court entails a
conclusive settlement of this dispute first, by interpreting the instruments
involved, then take into consideration the interest of the inhabitants’
effectivités and historical consolidation. A similar assignment was per-
formed by this Court in the case concerning the Territorial Dispute
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriyal/ Chad) in 1994 on what constitutes the initial
task of the Court. The Court therein described its assignment thus:

“The Court will first consider Article 3 of the 1955 Treaty, together
with the Annex to which that Article refers, in order to decide
whether or not that Treaty resulted in a conventional boundary
between the territories of the Parties. If the 1955 Treaty did result in
a boundary, this furnishes the answer to the issues raised by the
Parties: it would be a response at one and the same time to the
Libyan request to determine the limits of the respective territories of
the Parties and to the request of Chad to determine the course of the



frontier. The Court's initial task must therefore be to interpret the
relevant provisions of the 1955 Treaty, on which the Parties have
taken divergent positions.” (LC.J. Reports 1994, p. 20, para. 38;
emphasis added.)

29. In view of the claim of Nigeria over certain specific places, where
the inhabitants are affiliated to Nigeria and are being administered by
Nigeria, this provision in the Agreement ought to have been seriously
taken into consideration by the Court in its interpretation of the bound-
ary line, hence my disagreement with the decision of the Court.

30. The Parties’ concept and arguments aside, it is important to deter-
mine the duty of the Court as regards the dispute in Lake Chad. Clearly,
the Court is not called upon to demarcate and, quite obviously, this is
outside the assignment of the Court. Is this therefore a case of delimita-
tion or attribution for the Court? In a case of this nature, where there are
conflicting claims by the parties as to the location of the boundary and
disputed territorial sovereignty, the cardinal assignment of the Court is,
first to deal with the determination of the boundary by way of judicial
delimitation and subsequently to deal with the conflicting territorial
claims of the parties.

31. As indicated earlier, there are claims and counter-claims as to
whether the Lake Chad basin had been delimited or demarcated. Presum-
ably, if both Parties had definitively concluded the agreements on delimi-
tation and a fortiori demarcation, this Application might not be filed by
Cameroon. The preliminary objection of Nigeria on this point was rejected
by the Court. The duty of the Court here therefore is to determine
whether the boundary in Lake Chad had been delimited or not. If it had


“A. Boundary demarcation

— to approve the technical document on the demarcation of the
international boundaries of member States in the Lake Chad, as
endorsed by the national experts and the Executive Secretariat of
the LCBC.

— that each country should adopt the document in accordance with
its national laws.

— that the document should be signed latest by the next summit of
the Commission.

— to instruct state/local administrations of each country to mount
social mobilization campaigns to educate the local populations
on the demarcation and their rights and privileges on the Lake.

— congratulated the Commissioners, the national experts, the
Executive Secretariat and the Contractor IGN-France for a job
well done.” (Counter-Memorial of Nigeria, Vol. II, pp. 407-408,
para. 16.57.)

33. Yet, precisely five days after this apparently cordial meeting of
Heads of State in Abuja, where they expressed the view that the work of

cation for the confirmation of its sovereignty over certain areas of Lake
Chad and over Darak. This was the same area of boundary that the
Cameroonian Head of State, along with his Nigerian counterpart had,
only recently, endorsed.

34. The second unfortunate aspect of this litigation is that the LCBC,
its Executive Secretary, members, experts and the IGN laboured from
1983 to 1994 to ensure the final determination of the border in this sector
between Cameroon and Nigeria. However, it appears that this has now
become an exercise in futility — much ado about nothing — with colos-
sal waste of time, effort and money, since neither Nigeria nor Cameroon
ratified the boundary agreement (Cameroon later ratified in 1997). Cam-
eroon has now applied to the Court to start de novo what was close to
an agreement between the Parties. Must Cameroon approbate and rep-
robate? The findings of the LCBC are not binding either directly or indi-
rectly on the Court and neither is the LCBC bound by whatever may be
the decision of the Court on this area of the boundary. The jurisdiction
of the Court is consensual and it cannot bind other members of the
LCBC, such as Niger and Chad, who are not parties before the Court
(Art. 59 of the Statute of the Court). The Court is entitled to deal with
the bipoint between Cameroon and Nigeria but not the tripoint between
Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

vations during the jurisdictional phase of this case as regards the dispute
between both Parties in the Lake Chad area. It is pertinent to refer to the
observations of the Court herein before we proceed further:

“the Court notes that, with regard to the whole of the boundary,
there is no explicit challenge from Nigeria. However, a disagreement
on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests, or the
positive opposition of the claim of one party by the other need not
necessarily be stated expressis verbis. In the determination of the
existence of a dispute, as in other matters, the position or the atti-
tude of a party can be established by inference, whatever the pro-
fessed view of that party. In this respect the Court does not find
persuasive the argument of Cameroon that the challenge by Nigeria
to the validity of the existing titles to Bakassi, Darak and Tipsan,
necessarily calls into question the validity as such of the instruments
on which the course of the entire boundary from the tripoint in Lake
Chad to the sea 1s based, and therefore proves the existence of a dis-
pute concerning the whole of the boundary.” (I. C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 315, para. 89.)

36. The assignment given to the LCBC’s Sub-Committee on Boundary
Matters, which started in 1983, was completed in March 1994. IGN of
France was engaged to carry out the work which it completed in July-
1993 and submitted to the Executive Secretary; eventually all the experts

Heads of State in Abuja in March 1994, all the Heads of State present
signed the boundary documents, subject to ratification by each member
State. Cameroon did not ratify until 1997 and Nigeria has not ratified to
date. The IXth Summit of Heads of State was held in Chad in 1995. At
that time, the Application of Cameroon was already pending before the
Court and both Cameroon and Nigeria were absent from the Meeting.

37. What then is the legal effect of the work of the LCBC, with its
report and documents not ratified by all the member States before the
IXth Summit of Heads of State in 1995? Although all the Heads of State
present during the VIIIth Summit signed it, each country still had to
adopt it in accordance with its own national laws. The document had to
be ratified no later than the next Summit of the Commission in 1993, in
order to give it legal force. Cameroon and Nigeria failed to ratify before
the “next Summit”, even though Cameroon ratified subsequently. Since
the other two countries, Niger and Chad, are not before the Court they
are not bound by the decision of the Court. This is a fundamental prin-
ciple that the Court has pronounced upon many occasions. In the juris-
dictional phase of the case, this principle was once again reiterated thus:

“The Court recalls that it has always acknowledged as one of the
fundamental principles of its Statute that no dispute between States

can be decided without their consent to its jurisdiction (Monetary
Gold Removed from Rome in 1943, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1954,
p. 32). Nevertheless, the Court has also emphasized that it is not
necessarily prevented from adjudicating when the judgment it is asked
to give might affect the legal interests of a State which is not a party
to the case; and the Court has only declined to exercise jurisdiction
when the interests of the third State ‘constitute the very subject-
matter of the judgment to be rendered on the merits’ (Certain Phos-
phate Lands in Nauru ( Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1992, p. 61, para. 55; East Timor ( Portugal
v. Australia), Judgment, I. C.J Reports 1995, pp. 104-105, para. 34).”
(I. C.J. Reports 1998, p. 312, para. 79.)

38. In the above circumstances, and as the Court rightly decided, the
Agreement is not opposable to Nigeria and hence Nigeria is not bound
by it. Similarly, it cannot be said that this Agreement must be recognized
by all the member States of the LCBC. In the minutes of the VIIith Sum-
mit of the Heads of State and Government in Abuja 1994, the decision
reached was:

(a

— that each country should adopt the document in accordance
with its national laws.

— that the document should be signed latest by the next summit of
the Commission” (Counter-Memorial of Nigeria, Vol. X,
Ann. 285, Decision No. 5, p. 13).

In the absence of any evidence that these decisions have been carried out
by Cameroon and Nigeria, the document obviously will not be binding
on the Parties in this case.

39. Article 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is rele-
vant here. Although all the Heads of State signed the documents in
Abuja in 1994 (which Article 7 seeks to protect and validate), it is clear
from their decision that before the Agreement could enter into force, it
must be adopted and ratified by all the LCBC member States.

40. The task of the LCBC, which involves its Executive Secretary, the
members and experts from member States, covered the period from 1983
until 1994, The establishment of the LCBC was prompted by the distur-
bances in that region during the year 1983, which necessitated the con-
vening of the meeting of its members in Lagos from 21 to 23 July 1983.
The Sub-Committee on the Delimitation of the Borders was saddled with
the responsibility of the boundary determination. Necessary logistical
problems (including funding) delayed the exercise until 1988 when the
contract for the demarcation was signed between the LCBC and IGN
International of France on 26 May 1988.

41. Cameroon puts emphasis on the stage of the work of the contrac-
tor in 1990. It referred to the Report on the Marking-Out of the Inter-



national Boundaries in Lake Chad.. The experts of the LCBC introduced
this Report in the following terms:

“We the undersigned,

experts from the Member States of the CBLT/LCBC (Cameroon,
Niger, Nigeria and Chad), duly designated by our States to supervise
and monitor the work on the demarcation of our boundaries in
accordance with resolution No. 2 adopted by our Governments at
their Sixth Summit Meeting held in N'Djamena on 28 and 29 Octo-
ber 1987.

have proceeded, from 13 June 1988 to 12 February 1990, to effect
the delimitation and marking-out of the said boundaries and submit
to the approval of the respective Governments the following descrip-
tion of the boundaries that we marked out.” (Counter-Memorial of
Nigeria, Vol. TI, p. 403, para. 16.50; emphasis added.)

42. The argument of Cameroon as stated above can be faulted on five

report and not a binding agreement; secondly, not all the experts from
member States signed; thirdly, the Report was still incomplete; fourthly,
the Report itself states that it was being submitted to the Heads of State
for approval; and, fifthly, the task of the experts was not to approve the
work of IGN of France: they were only mandated to supervise and moni-
tor the work. As regards the nature of the document as a report, even the
Memorial of Cameroon referred to above expressly described it as such.
It was introduced as the Report on the Marking-Out of the International
Boundaries and no more.

43. The task of the Commission on the Boundary was not concluded
in 1990 but continued through 1991, 1992 and 1993. This was because
IGN International of France had not completed the technical task and
the expert of Nigeria and, at another stage, the expert of Chad, were not
satisfied with the Report and they insisted on some technical amend-
ments. The comment of Nigeria on this point is very illuminating:

“At a meeting of LCBC Experts in January 1992, Nigeria indi-
cated that it was now ready to implement the resolution of the 39th
Meeting and to sign the ‘report on demarcation’ (NPO 75). The
Commission noted the intention of the experts to implement the
resolution by June 1992 (page 715 of NPO 75). At the 41st Session
of the Commission in April 1993 (see extracts of Minutes at
NC-M 284), it was reported that the experts has gone back to the

demarcation document. However, because of a dispute regarding the
location of Beacon VI on the Chad/Cameroon boundary, the Chad
Commissioner stated that he was unable to endorse that aspect of



the work, and as a result of there being a lack of consensus, it was
resolved that the ‘documents regarding the demarcation exercise’ be
signed by the Executive Secretary and made available to the Com-
missioners for presentation to their Governments so that the issue
could be finalised at the next Summit.” (Counter-Memorial of
Nigeria, Vol. II, p. 406, para. 16.54.)

44. As reflected in the memorandum of Nigeria in November of 1990
at the 39th meeting of the Commissioners, the Nigerian delegation refused
to sign the report for the reason that was expressed thus:

“In November 1990, at their 39th meeting, the Commissioners
resolved that the national experts should go back to the field to com-
plete some specific jobs relating to two intermediate beacons . . . In
the course of the discussions of the relevant subcommission, the
position of the Nigerian delegation as recorded in the Minutes was
as follows . . .

sidered that the project was not fully completed (the failure to
number beacon II-IIl.1, substandard quality of numbering by
LCBC, non-demolition of beacon II-V.1 which was wrongly
erected, non stabilisation of GPS and Azimuth station on lines
I-II and II-V and disappearance of two GPS stations on line I-IT)

In consequence, Nigeria refused to sign the Report of the experts
on the beaconing. At a June 1991 meeting of experts, Nigeria rejected
this resolution of the 39th Meeting . . .” (Ibid, Vol. II, p. 405,
para. 16.52.)

45. As referred to earlier, the experts of member States were not man-
dated to sign the final agreement for or on behalf of the Governments or
Heads of State. They were instructed to prepare and submit a report for
the approval of the Heads of State at their Summit, which they did at the
VITIth Summit, for their signature. That precisely was their undertaking
as stated in the Report. They unequivocally expressed the duty that they
were called upon to carry out — “to supervise and monitor”. Therefore,
whatever was signed by the experts of member States cannot bind the
Parties in this case. It cannot, therefore be said that the mission entrusted
to the LCBC and the manner in which it was carried out resulted in the
recognition by the LCBC member States that a delimitation in the Lake
Chad area already existed. The Commission was not so mandated. The
ultimate decision lies with the Heads of State. In 1994, the Report was

was to be subsequently ratified. That ratification did not happen, at least



as far as Nigeria is concerned. Hence my view is that the Court ought to
ignore the report and agreement of the LCBC. Tacitly, therefore, the
decision of the Court to reject Cameroon’s submission that the Parties
are bound by the LCBC’s Report is valid. However, the Court ought to
have taken into consideration other factors, such as effectivités and
historical consolidation in order to come to a determination on the delimi-
tation of Lake Chad.

Delimitation and Demarcation

46. Reading through the oral and the written pleadings in this case one
must admit that there is a degree of misunderstanding or even confusion
in the use of the words delimitation and demarcation. Perhaps, for the
purpose of elucidation and to clear the apparent convolution, we may
borrow a definition of these two terminologies from a textbook on inter-
national law:

“The distinction sometimes made between artificial and natural
boundaries is geographical rather than legal, for so-called natural
boundaries, making use of natural features such as rivers or moun-

boundary line. The common practice for land boundaries is, in a
boundary treaty or award, to describe the boundary line in words,
i.e. to ‘delimit’ it; and then to appoint boundary commissions,
usually joint, to apply the delimitation to the ground and if necessary
to mark it with boundary posts or the like, i.e. to ‘demarcate’ it.”
(Oppenheim’s International Law, 9th ed., Vol. 1 (Peace), Parts 2-4,
Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts (eds.), p. 662.)

47. The claim of Cameroon is that the LCBC has delimited the bound-
ary with the aid of the relevant instruments already mentioned. The view
of Nigeria is that nothing has been delimited or demarcated conclusively.
Nigeria agrees that certain instruments are relevant for the purpose of
delimitation but that the area of Lake Chad is not part of it. Cameroon
argues that the demarcation had been fully and finally effected by the
LCBC and the same sanctioned by the Heads of State. For the reason
already given above, I disagree with Cameroon, as the Court has also
done. However, since delimitation precedes demarcation, and delimita-
tion in this case is not just simply confirming the instruments that delimit,
but these instruments must be given judicial interpretation having regard
to the conflicting view of the Parties, the Court is therefore called upon to
determine the issue of delimitation, whilst the Parties will undertake that
of demarcation. But in doing so the Court fails to take into consideration
factors other than the instruments.

Lake Chad Basin: Effectivités and Historical Consolidation

48. As mentioned earlier, and based on the evidence presented to the
Court by both Parties on this matter and particularly Nigeria, I am
strongly of the view that the issue of effectivité and historical consolida-
tion ought invariably to be given consideration in this case. My reason
for saying so has been partly explained in the introductory part of this
opinion and partly in the sector on Bakassi Peninsula below. Here refer-
ence must be made to the jurisprudence of the Court, in the Frontier Dis-
pute (Burkina Fasol Republic of Mali) case, particularly in terms of the
pronouncement of the Court with regard to the position of effectivités in
relation to legal title. There is enough reason and justification for the
Court to take these legal principles of historical consolidation and effec-
tivités into consideration. It has been established that in so many areas in
Lake Chad, the Milner-Simon Declaration of 1919 with the annexed
Moisel map and the Thompson-Marchand Declaration of 1929-1930, as
confirmed by the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of Notes of 9 January
1931, are not sufficiently precise and in most cases inaccurate to present
a clear picture of delimitation in Lake Chad. The boundary thus requires
adjustments and clarifications which can only be taken care of by effec-
tivités and historical consolidation.

49. The Lake Chad basin is constantly in a state of flux as to its waters
and its inhabitants kept moving with the receding waters from time to

opment that the importance of maintaining this state of things ought
to be considered as prevailing over a claim possibly based either on
discovery in very distant times and unsupported by occupation, or
on mere geographical position” (H. Lauterpacht, The Function of
Law in International Community, p. 120).

Added to all these uncertainties in the area of Lake Chad is the fact
that there has never been any definitive delimitation, let alone demarca-
tion. A clear picture of the situation in Lake Chad is that the inhabitants
have been living at large regardless of where the boundary lies, and some
of them have been there for many years. It is precisely a situation like this
that calls for justice in favour of these inhabitants, most of whom owe
allegiance to Ngala local government in Nigeria and their Nigerian Bula-



mas (chiefs). This spread of inhabitants in Lake Chad is not unusual, we
have similar examples in the area of the land boundary between Nigeria
and Cameroon where, for example, in the Nigerian village of Koja, the
Nigerian inhabitants have spread over into the Cameroonian side of the
boundary. Again, in the Cameroonian village of Turu, the inhabitants
have spread into the Nigerian territory. The Court in its wisdom has
decided to allow the Parties to resolve these incursions themselves by
peaceful settlement. The arbitrator in the Island of Palmas case estab-

matters of this nature by weighing the relative merits of the titles claimed.
He said:

“International law, like law in general, has the object of assuring
the coexistence of different interests which are worthy of legal pro-
tection. If, as in the present instance, only one of two conflicting
interests is to prevail, because sovereignty can be attributed to but
one of the Parties, the interest which involves the maintenance of a
state of things having offered at the critical time to the inhabitants of
the disputed territory, and to other States, a certain guarantee for
the respect of their rights ought, in doubt, to prevail over an interest
which — supposing it to be recognized in international law — has
not yet received any concrete form of development.” (H. Lauter-
pacht, op. cit., pp. 119-120.)

In my view, this statement of Max Huber is reflected in the Frontier Dis-
pute ( Burkina Fasol Republic of Mali) case, that:

“In the event that the effectivité does not co-exist with any legal
title, it must invariably be taken into consideration. Finally, there are
cases where the legal title is not capable of showing exactly the ter-
ritorial expanse to which it relates. The effectivités can then play an
essential role in showing how the title is interpreted in practice.”
(L.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 587, para. 63; emphasis added.)

50. In this particular case therefore, it is effectivité that can assist in
fully complementing the content of the legal title. This definitely is not a
case of effectivité contra legem, but one that must invariably be given rec-
ognition and consideration. Quite patently, the Frontier Dispute ( Burkina
Fasol Republic of Mali) case is the authority on this point. The Court
cannot interpret a part of paragraph 63 of the Judgment in that case, and
leave the other part uninterpreted. After all, Cameroon in effect accepted
the overwhelming evidence of effectivités put forward by Nigeria.

51. Nigeria strongly and extensively pinpoints the obvious deficiencies
in many of these instruments. Cameroon also agrees with many of the
deficiencies as highlighted by Nigeria. One example is the Moisel map as



well as the map attached to the 1931 Declaration. Another problematic
area is the mouth of the Ebeji. The difficulties encountered by the LCBC
throughout the duration of their work on the Lake Chad boundary is not
unconnected with the problems of inaccuracies, uncertainties and incon-
gruities when it comes to delimitation and demarcation.

52. The role of effectivité which deals majorly with the conduct and
practice of the parties and has its legal basis founded on some of the pro-
visions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, par-
ticularly its paragraph 31, has as its advantage, the need to ensure stabil-
ity along the boundaries of two States. Short of invalidating a legal title
that bears no relation to the situation on the ground, effectivité comes in
to play the role of sustaining complementarily the boundary based on the
practice and conduct of the parties over the years which, in effect, is simi-
lar to the principle of uti possidetis juris (de facto). Consequently, effec-
tivité comes in to adjust, vary or amend such boundary as may be struc-
turally established by the legal title.

53. This view is not strange to the Court. Apart from certain infer-
ences made by it on a similar matter in the Kasikili/Sedudu Island ( Bot-
swanal Namibia) case, an illustration of such a principle was made in the
Advisory Opinion of 1971 in the case concerning the Legal Consequences
for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia ( South
West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970),
where the Court states:

“This procedure followed by the Security Council, which has con-
