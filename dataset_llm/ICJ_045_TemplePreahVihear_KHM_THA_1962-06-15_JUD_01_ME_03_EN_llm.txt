Although 1 am in full agreement with the operational part of
the Judgment of the Court, and with its reasoning and language,
there are certain matters which I should like to develop futher, and
others—not mentioned in the Judgment—which seem to me to
require a brief discussion.

The Judgment states that the Court is not called upon to go
into the situation as it existed previous to the treaty settlement
of 1904; and this is true inasmuch as the rights of the Parties depend
on, or flow from, that settlement, or events subsequent to it. There
is however one fact, not referred to in the Judgment, which could
have been of decisive importance in this case, namely that, previous
to the boundary settlements of the period 1904-1908, the Temple
of Preah Vihear was situated in territory that was, at that time,
under Siamese sovereignty, because a treaty of 15 July 1867
between France (acting on behalf of Cambodia} and Siam (as Thai-
land was then called) had established a frontier line running w=ll
south of the Dangrek range of mountains, across the Cambodian
plain. Since the effect of the 1904 treaty settlement was to shift
the frontier to the north, and to place it along the general line of
the Dangrek range, it follows that, by this settlement, Thailand
was giving up territory. As a consequence, there arises a presump-
tion In favorem ejus qui dat that Thailand did not relinquish any
territory she cannot be proved to have relinquished. This means that
in any conflict between a more northerly and a more southerly
frontier line in the region of Preah Vihear, the latter line must be
held to prevail, unless the former can be established. I agree with
the Court that the former (i.e. the more northerly) line can be,
and is, established, for the reasons given in the Judgment; but the
foregoing considerations require to be stated in order that the
significance of the conclusion may be fully apparent.

The matter is brought into relief in another way. Throughout
these proceedings Thailand has contended that, there never having
been (as she maintains) any effective delimitation of the frontier
in the eastern sector of the Dangrek range, as required by Article 3



of the Treaty of 1904, the result (by virtue of Article 1) is automati-
cally to cause the frontier to run along the line of the watershed
as ascertained by scientific survey. An interpretation even more
favourable to Thailand would however be that, in the absence of
the delimitation required by Article 3, in completion of Article 1,
the latter provision could not have taken any practical effect, so
that no new frontier line under the Treaty of 1904 would have
come into existence at all, and the frontier would have remained
as it was immediately previous to 1904, with the Temple area in
Thailand. Since both these interpretations are favourable to Thai-
land, and either would have been decisive if the Court had not
held that Thailand had in any event, subsequently, and inde-
pendently, accepted a frontier placing the Temple in Cambodia,
it was not necessary to choose between them.

durable.

Considerations of a topographical,
historical and cultural character

The Court has dismissed these in a sentence, as not being legally
decisive. I agree that they are not; but I think it desirable to say
why, since these considerations occupied a prominent place in
the arguments of the Parties. Such matters may have some legal
relevance in a case about territorial sovereignty which turns on
the weight of factual evidence that each party can adduce in
support of its claim, and not on any more concrete and positive
element, such as a treaty. In the present case it is accepted, and
indeed contended by both Parties, that their rights derive from the
treaty settlement of 1904, and on the subsequent events relative to
or affecting that settlement. In consequence, extraneous factors
which might have weighed with them in making that settlement,
and more particularly in determining how the line of the frontier
was to run, can only have an incidental relevance in determining
where today, as a matter of law, it does run.

Although I do not dissent from what the Judgment says under
this head, I think many of the facts are so conjectural that it
is exceedingly difficult to draw any sure conclusions from them.
Various inferences may be more or less reasonable and warranted,
but when all is said and done the only certain thing is that the
Annex I map was produced in Paris by French topographical
officers in November 1907, and was never, as such, seen (much
less approved or adopted) by the Mixed Commission, which indeed
appears to have ceased to function entirely after about February
of that year—or at any rate it did not, after January, hold any
meeting of which there is any record. Whether the map was based
on any instructions that the Commission had given, or on rough
sketches approved by it, must, in the absence of any evidence,
remain a matter of surmise. It seems to me therefore that Thailand
succeeds on this part of the case, about which it is hardly
necessary to say more than that, however respectable the



provenance of the map was, it must be held to have been a purely
unilateral production, not in any way binding on Thailand at the
moment of its communication to her, and subject entirely, at that
time, to her acceptance or rejection, either in whole or in part.

Thailand's acceptance by conduct of the Annex I line

Had the matter ended with the production of the map; or if
the map had never been officially communicated to Thailand;
or had been communicated in such a way, or in such circumstances,
that no adverse conclusion could be drawn from her failure to react;
or had been communicated but rejected, either as a whole, or in
relation to Preah Vihear; then Thailand would, in my opinion,
have been entitled to a finding in her favour, since I personally
consider that there is little reasonable doubt that, in this particular
region, the true line of the watershed runs, and ran in 1904, along
the line of the escarpment. (Moreover, I could not myself regard
the deviation from the line of the watershed at Preah Vihear as
being covered by any discretionary powers of adaptation which
the Mixed Commission might have possessed; but this matter is
not in any event material, since it was not the Mixed Commission
as such which made or approved the map.)

The crucial issue in this case is therefore whether Thailand, by
her conduct in 1908, and thereafter, in fact accepted the Annex I
map line as representing the outcome of the work of delimitation
provided for by the Treaty of 1904, knowing how it had been pro-
duced; or, more simply, whether Thailand just accepted the line
as being the frontier line, accepting also the risk of its possible
inaccuracy.

The Judgment of the Court answers these questions in the affir-
mative, on grounds in which I fully concur. In doing so, I am not
unmindful of the fact that acceptance by conduct alone, of an obliga-
tion in the nature of a treaty obligation, is not lightly to be pre-
sumed ; especially where a frontier is in question; and even more
so where the frontier line thus said to be accepted involves a
departure from the delimitary criterion indicated by the relevant
treaty. But if the plea of error or misapprehension is excluded, as
I think it has to be (see below), I can place no other interpretation
on Thailand’s conduct, considered as a whole, than that she ac-
cepted this particular line as representing the frontier in this region.
Moreover, even negative conduct—that is to say failure to act,
react or speak, in circumstances where failure so to do must imply
acquiescence or acceptance—is, in my opinion, quite sufficient for
this purpose, if the facts are clear.

The Court has dealt very fully with this matter, but it is so
central to the whole issue in this case that I desire to make some
additional remarks about it.

In the interests of the stability of contracts, the principle of
error as vitiating consent is usually applied somewhat strictly; and
I consider that this approach is also the correct one in international
law, in the interests of the stability of treaties, and of frontier
lines established by treaty or other forms of agreement. That there
was (as I think) an error in the map by reference to the true water-
shed line does not necessarily mean that Thailand was herself
under any misapprehension, nor that, if she was, she can, in law,
now plead the fact. The Siamese authorities, in 1908 and thereafter,
cannot possibly have failed to realize that the Annex I map showed
Preah Vihear as being in Cambodia, since it so clearly did; and for
the reasons given in the Judgment of the Court, the fact that, at
this time, the Siamese authorities may have attached no importance
to the Temple, or may have failed to realize the importance it
would eventually assume for them, is legally quite irrelevant. This
could never, per se, be a legal ground for claiming frontier rectifi-
cation.


The explanation of all this, there can be no reasonable doubt, is
that, in effect, everyone on the Siamese side relied on the skill
and good faith of the French topographical officers producing the
maps. There can equally be no doubt that the latter acted in com-
plete good faith, used all their skill, and fully believed that the
watershed in the Preah Vihear region ran as indicated by the An-
nex I line. One may sympathize with Siam’s lack of topographical
and cartographical expertise at this time, but one is dealing with
sovereign independent States to whom certain rules of law apply;
and it remains the fact that, in the absence of any question of
lack of good faith, the legal effect of reliance on the skill of an
expert is that one must abide by the results—in short, a principle
akin to that of caveat emptor is relevant. This is so in all walks
of life. A man who consults a lawyer, doctor, architect, or other
expert, is held (in the absence of fraud or negligence—not here
in question) to accept the possibility that the expert may be
mistaken in the advice he gives, or less than perfect in the work
he does. Like all human beings, he is fallible. Except in cases in
which the doctrine of “absolute” risk or liability prevails, the law



as a general rule affords no remedy against errors made in good
faith and without negligence by duly qualified experts. The dangers
of giving expert advice could not otherwise be accepted. The
French officers in this case were of course fallible. They for instance
(and both Parties were agreed about this) made an error over the
course of the O”Tasem stream, which must have affected the whole
question of how the watershed line ran in the Preah Vihear region.
The authorities of French Indo-China were unaware of this error.
They accepted the map as correct. Equally, the Siamese authorities,
knowing the character and provenance of the map, being in a posi-
tion to consult their Commissioners who had received it, or experts
of their own choice, made no objection, and raised no query, in
relation to a line which was clearly intended to represent and con-
stitute the line of the frontier in this region, and which anyone
looking at it must have seen at once placed Preah Vihear on the
Cambodian side of the line. Today Thailand says the map was
erroneous and that she was under a misapprehension about it.
But the Siamese authorities of that date plainly accepted the risk
that just such an error as this might in time be discovered: and
whoever does that, must be held thereby also, and in advance, to
have accepted such errors as do in fact eventually come to light.


I also could not help being struck by the evidence of one of Thai-
land’s own expert witnesses—a patently honest and reliable one,
it seemed to me—to the effect that, in the course of a visit to this
region in July 1961, during which he spent eleven days in carrying
out a survey of the Temple area, he saw no sign of the inhabitants,
rice cultivations, or forestry or other activities, that figure sc
prominently in the evidence furnished by Thailand respecting the
period following on the treaty settlements of 1904-1908. This
witness, when cross-examined on behalf of Cambodia, was asked
whether he saw any people living between Preah Vihear and the
nearest village on the Thai side—a distance of 10-15 kilometres—
‘and he answered “No, there is [sc. he saw] nobody living there”.
When asked whether he saw any people on Mount Preah Vihear
itself, he said that, apart from the Thai police post, and one guard
at the Temple, he saw “occasionally a few visitors ... or tourists”.
When asked whether he saw any people cultivating rice, he said



“No. This area is covered by jungle forests and there is no rice
cultivation”. Asked whether he saw any woodcutters or foresters
about, he replied “During the eleven days I stayed there I did not
see anybody”. In re-examination on behalf of Thailand, no questions
were put to the witness on these points.

It is obviously not permissible from this evidence, particularly
on the basis of so short a stay, to draw any definite conclusion as to
the situation existing at the earlier period. But even in eleven
days it is possible to see if, in a restricted area, there are any habi-
tations, cultivations, forestry work in progress, and so on. It seems
therefore reasonable to infer—taking the scale of Siamese activity
in this area, in the period following on the treaty settlement, to
have been as indicated in the evidence furnished by Thailand—
that it must since have undergone a notable diminution.

Cambodia however claimed another effect for the Treaties of
1925 and 1937, namely that by confirming the frontiers as already
established, they imparted a new and independent treaty basis
to the Annex I line, thereby validating it, even if it was not valid
before. I do not think this contention well-founded. Such a con-
firmation of the existing frontiers no doubt implied that frontiers
did exist, and possibly also that they existed and were complete
at all points of contact between the two countries; but this could
not, by itself, say anything at all as to what these frontiers were,
or how exactly they ran. A confirmation only confirms what is;
it cannot per se alter, add to, or detract from the latter, which must
be ascertained ab extra—in this case by reference to the previous
treaty settlements and the events relevant to them. The confirma-
tion was evidence of the importance the Parties attached to the
frontiers, but otherwise it left matters as they were, whatever they
were.

The principle of preclusion and estoppel

The Court has applied this principle in the present case to the
effect that even if there could be any doubt as to whether Thailand did
originally accept the Annex I map and line, so as to become bound
by it, she is precluded by her subsequent conduct from now assert-
ing her non-acceptance. With this conclusion I agree (it being postu-
lated, for reasons already given. that no error or misapprehension
can be pleaded). But the Court only glances at the matter, which
needs a good deal of development.

The principle of preclusion is the nearest equivalent in the field
of international law to the common-law rule of estoppel, though
perhaps not applied under such strict limiting conditions (and it
1s certainly applied as a rule of substance and not merely as one
of evidence or procedure). It is quite distinct theoretically from the
notion of acquiescence. But acquiescence can operate as a preclu-
sion or estoppel in certain cases, for instance where silence, on an
occasion where there was a duty or need to speak or act, implies
agreement, or a waiver of rights, and can be regarded as a represen-
tation to that effect (see the cases, and the quotation from an
Opinion of the British Law Officers, cited in Dr. D. W. Bowett’s
article, “Estoppel before international tribunals and its relation to
acquiescence”, in the British Year Book of International Law for
1957, at pp. 197-201; and see also Lord McNair’s Law of Treaties,
1961, p. 488). On that basis, it must be held in the present case that
Thailand’s silence, in circumstances in which silence meant ac-
quiescence, or acted as a representation où acceptance of the map



line, operates to preclude or estop her from denying such acceptance,
or operates as a waiver of her original right to reject the map line
or its direction at Preah Vihear.


There is of course no general rule whatever requiring that a
conflict of this kind should be resolved in favour of the map line,
and there have been plenty of cases (some of which were cited before
the Court) where it has not been, even though the map was one of
the instruments forming part of the whole treaty settlement (as
here), and not a mere published sheet or atlas page—in which case
it would, in itself, have no binding character for the parties. The
question is one that must always depend on the interpretation of



the treaty settlement, considered as a whole, in the light of the
circumstances in which it was arrived at. So considered in the
present case, I agree with the Court that, in this particular instance,
the question of interpretation must be resolved in favour of the
map line.
