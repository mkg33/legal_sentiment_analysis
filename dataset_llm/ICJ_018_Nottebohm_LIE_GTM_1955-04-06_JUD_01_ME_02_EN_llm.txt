I am unable to concur in the Judgment of the Court, which
holds that the claim submitted by the Principality of Liechtenstein
is inadmissible. It is, therefore, necessary for me to indicate my
conclusions as to the proper disposition of the plea in bar, and to
give my reasons. In doing so, I must examine certain of the grounds
which were relied on by Counsel, in the Pleadings and during the
Oral Proceedings, but which were not adopted as a basis for the
Judgment.

At the outset, I consider that the very nature of a plea in bar
controls the examination of the issues. The allowance of a plea
in bar prevents an examination by the Court of the issues of law
and fact which consitute the merits of the case. It would be unjust.
to refuse to examine a claim on the merits on the basis of findings
of law or fact which might be reversed if the merits were considered
and dealt with.

Accordingly, it is necessary, at this stage, to proceed upon the
assumption that all of Liechtenstein’s contentions on the merits,
fact and law, are well-founded; and that Guatemala’s contentions
on the merits may be ill-founded.

circumstances I am bound to proceed on the assumption that
Liechtenstein might be entitled to a finding of denial of justice,
if the case should be considered on the merits.

In view of this situation, I cannot overlook the fact that the
allowance of the plea in bar would ensure that justice would not
be done on any plane, national or international. I do not think
that a plea in bar, which would have such an gffect, should be
granted, unless the grounds on which it is based aré beyond doubt.

With these considerations in- mind, it is necessary to examine
the single issue that.the Court must decide in order to reject or
allow the plea in bar based on the ground of nationality. The issue
for decision is : whether, in the circumstances of this case and vis-à-vis
Guatemala, Liechtenstein is entitled, under the rules of international
law, to afford diplomatic protection to Mr. Nottebohm.

The first ‘¢round for holding that the claim is inadmissible, which
is contained in paragraph 2 (a) of the Final Conclusions of Guate-
mala, may be stated shortly : that Mr. Nottebohm did not acquire
Liechtenstein nationality in accordance with the law of the Prin-
cipality. While the Judgment of the Court does not rely on this
ground, I must state my position, in order to justify my conclusion
that the plea in bar as a whole should be joined to the merits.

Here, the production of the certificate of naturalization, and
the adoption of the claim by Liechtenstein, establish à prima facie
case. The Court can go back of the certificate and disregard it on -
proof of fraud in the application for or grant of the naturalization,
or in the obtaining or issuing of the certificate. But there has been
no such proof.

It has been argued that the Court can and should examine the
Liechtenstein law and the procedure followed by the Liechtenstein
authorities when the naturalization was granted. It has been
contended that they did not comply with the law and that, as a
result of their defaults, the naturalization granted was a nullity.

To begin with, it is necessary to take into account the juris-
prudence of the Permanent Court. Two principles of law have been
established. The judgment in The Mavrommatis Jerusalem Con-



cessions—Series A, No. 5, at page 30—settled the rule that the
burden of proof is on the party, that alleges the nullity of a legal
act under the national law, to prove it.

The other principle is to be found in a long series of decisions,
which applied the principle : that “municipal laws are merely facts
which express the will and constitute the activities of States’ and
that the Court does not interpret the national law as such.

In the present case, Guatemala has alleged the invalidity or
nullity of the legal act of naturalization under the national law.
The burden of proof is on Guatemala to prove it. But Guatemala
has not furnished any admissible evidence ; such as the testimony
of a jurist learned and experienced in Liechtenstein law, or an
opinion from the Highest Court in that country. The case has been
presented as if this Court was competent to interpret the Liechten-
stein law as such, and to pass upon its application to the special
circumstances of this case. It has been argued without consideration
of the provisions of the Liechtenstein law regarding the inter-
pretation of statutes or of the decisions of its courts.

Accordingly, the contention of the respondent Government, as
regards invalidity under the national law, fails through lack of
evidence to support it.

But this is not merely a case of failure of proof. Even if the
Liechtenstein Law of 1934 is interpreted without regard to the
rules of interpretation, procedure and administrative law in force
in that country, it is impossible to reach the conclusion that the
naturalization was a nullity. There is a fundamental error in the
method of interpretation adopted by Counsel, both in the Pleadings
and in the Oral Proceedings.

particular, it ignored a provision which is of crucial importance,
Article 21, which contains the following paragraph :



Section 21

“The Princely Government may, within five years from the date
of acquisition thereof, deprive a foreign national of the citizenship
of the Principality which has been granted to him, if it appears
that the requirements laid down in this law as governing the grant
thereof were not satisfied. It is entitled, however, at any time, to
deprive a person of the citizenship of the Principality if the acquisi-
tion thereof has come about in a fraudulent manner.”

It is clear that the naturalization of Mr. Nottebohm could have
been revoked at any time within five years of the grant, if it had
appeared that any of “the requirements laid down in this law were
not satisfied”. It is equally clear that, after the expiration of the
five-year period—i.e. in October 1944—the naturalization became
indefeasible, apart from fraud. In such circumstances, it is not
open to me, nearly sixteen years after the event and in the absence
of fraud, to find that the naturalization was invalid under the
Liechtenstein law.

The second ground for holding that the claim is inadmissible,
which is contained in paragraph 2 .(b) of the Final Conclusions of
Guatemala, may be stated shortly: that naturalization was not
granted to Mr. Nottebohm in accordance with the generally recog-
nized principles in regard to nationality.

Conclusion 2 (4) is obviously defective. The Court cannot deter-
mine “generally recognized principles” or decide cases on the basis
of such principles. Its competence is limited by the peremptory and
mandatory provisions of Article 38 of the Statute, to decision
“in accordance with international law”.

However, the position taken by Counsel makes it clear that the
Final Conclusion 2 (b) was intended to raise the issue of abuse of
right.

Abuse of right is based on the assumption that there is a right
to be abused. In the present case it is based upon the assumption
that Liechtenstein had the right under international law to natura-
lize Mr. Nottebohm, but that, in view of the special circumstances
and the manner in which the right was exercised, there was an
improper exercise of the right—an exercise so outrageous and
unconscionable that its result, i.e. the national status conferred on
Mr. Nottebohm, could not be invoked against Guatemala.

The doctrine of abuse of right cannot be invoked by one State
against another unless the State which is admittedly exercising
its rights under international law causes damage to the State
invoking the doctrine.

As this ground is not relied upon in the Judgment of the Court,
it is unnecessary for me to examine the particular grounds relied



on by Counsel. It is sufficient to point out that Liechtenstein
caused no damage to Guatemala, and that it is therefore necessary
to reject the Final Conclusion 2 (3).

The third ground for holding that the claim is inadmissible,
which is contained in paragraph 2 (c) of the Final Conclusions of
Guatemala, is based on fraud.

It is impossible to separate the aspects of fraud which are relevant
to the plea in bar from those which concern the merits. The greater
part of the evidence adduced in support of the charge of fraud was
contained in considerably more than one hundred documents.
From these documents a few were selected and brought to the
attention of the Court. The remaining documents were not placed
at the disposition of the Court.

In these circumstances, it is not possible for me to found any
conclusion based on fraud at this stage in the case. I am therefore
of the opinion that the Guatemalan Final Conclusion 2 (c) should
be joined to the merits.

There is another aspect of the question, which must be considered.
The Judgment of the Court is based upon the ground that the
naturalization of Mr. Nottebohm was not a genuine transaction.
It is pointed out that it did not lead to any alteration in his manner
of life ; and that it was acquired, not for the purpose of obtaining
legal recognition of his membership in fact of the population of
Liechtenstein, but for the purpose of obtaining neutral status and
the diplomatic protection of a neutral State.

This ground, to which I shall refer as the link theory, as it is
based on the quality of the relation between Mr. Nottebohm and
Liechtenstein, cannot be related to the Final Conclusions of Guate-
mala, or to the argument in the Pleadings and Oral Proceedings.

Accordingly, the matter is governed by the principle which was
applied by this Court in the Ambatielos case (Jurisdiction), Judg-
ment of July 1st, 1952, I.C.J. Reports 1952, at page 45 :

“The point raised here has not yet been fully argued by the
Parties, and cannot, therefore, be decided at this stage.”

Indirectly, some aspects were discussed as elements of abuse of
right, but not as a rule of international law limiting the power of a
sovereign State to exercise the right of diplomatic protection in
respect of one of its naturalized citizens.



As a Judge of this Court, I am bound to apply the principle of
international law, thus declared by this Court. I cannot concur in
the adoption of this ground—not included in the Conclusions and
not argued by either Party—as the basis for the allowance of the
plea in bar, and for the prevention of its discussion, consideration
and disposition on the merits.

To begin with, I do not question the desirability of establishing
some limitation on the wide discretionary power possessed by
sovereign States : the right, under international law, to determine,
under their own laws, who are their own nationals and to protect
such nationals.

Nevertheless, I am bound, by Article 38 of the Statute, to apply
international law as it is—positive law—and not international law
as it might be if a Codification Conference succeeded in establishing
new rules limiting the conferring of nationality by sovereign
States. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether there are any
rules of positive international law requiring a substantial relation-
ship between the individual and the State, in order that a valid
grant of nationality may give rise to a right of diplomatic pro-
tection.

Both Parties rely on Article 1 of The Hague Draft Convention of
1930 as an accurate statement of the recognized rules of interna-
tional law. Commenting on it, the Government of Guatemala
stated in the Counter-Memorial (p. 7) that “there can be no doubt
that its Article 1 represented the existing state of international
law”. It reads as follows :

“It is for each State to determine under its own law who are its
nationals. This law shall be recognized by other States in so far
as it is consistent with international conventions, international
custom, and the principles of law generally recognized with regard
to nationality.”

Applying this rule to the case, it would result that Liechtenstein
had the right to determine under its own law that Mr. Nottebohm
was its own national, and that Guatemala must recognize the
Liechtenstein law in this regard in so far as it is consistent with
international conventions, international custom, and the principles of
law generally recognized with regard to nationality. 1 shall refer to

I have mentioned that no ‘‘international conventions’ are
involved and that no ‘international custom has been proved”.
It has been conceded by Guatemala that ‘‘there is no system of
customary rules”, but the link theory is supported by the view
that certain international conventions suggest the existence of a
trend. I must deal with this point before considering whether the
firm view of the law on which the two Parties are in complete
agreement should be rejected.

The first international convention is Article 3 (2) of the Statute,
which deals with the problem of double nationality. It has nothing
to do with diplomatic protection and is not in any sense relevant
to the problem under consideration. It is true that it accepts as a
test in the case of double nationality the place in which the person
“ordinarily exercises civil and political rights’. Even if this test


4I NOTTEBOHM CASE (Drss. OPIN. OF JUDGE READ)

can be dragged from an entirely different setting and applied to
the present case, it does not contribute much to the solution.
Mr. Nottebohm has, in the course of the last fifty years, been
linked with four States. He was a German national during thirty-
four years, but exercised neither civil nor political rights in that
country. He was ordinarily resident in Guatemala for nearly forty
years, but exercised no political rights at any time in that country
and has been prevented from exercising important civil rights for
twelve years. He was a prisoner in the United States of America
for more than two years, where he exercised neither civil nor
political rights. Since his release, he has been'accorded full civil
rights in the United States and has exercised them freely, but he
has had no political rights in that country. He has had full civil
rights in Liechtenstein for nearly sixteen years, and has exercised
full political rights for nine. Article 3 (2) certainly does not weaken
the Liechtenstein position. ‘

The United States of America, between the years 1868 and 1928,
concluded bilateral conventions with about eighteen countries, not
including Liechtenstein, which limited the power of protectihg
naturalized persons who returned to their countries of origin. The
same sort of restriction on the opposability of naturalization was
incorporated in a Pan-American Convention concluded at Rio de
Janeiro in 1906. Liechtenstein was precluded from participation.
Venezuela refused to sign the Convention. Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico,
Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay signed the Convention but did not
ratify it. Brazil and Guatemala have both denounced its provisions.

The fact that it was considered necessary to conclude the series
of bilateral conventions and to establish the multilateral Convention
referred to above indicates that the countries concerned were not
content to rely on the possible existence of a rule of positive
international law qualifying the right of protection. Further, even
within that part of the Western hemisphere which is South of
the 49th Parallel, the ratifications of the multilateral Convention
were not sufficiently general to indicate consensus of the countries
concerned. Taking them together, the Conventions are too few
and far between to indicate a trend or to show the general consensus
on the part of States which is essential to the establishment of
a rule of positive international law.

application to this case of the principles adopted by arbitral
tribunals in dealing with cases of double nationality.



There have been many instances of double nationality in which
international tribunals have been compelled to decide between
conflicting claims. In such cases, it has been necessary to choose ;
and the choice has been determined by the relative strength of
the association between the individual concerned and his national
State. There have been many instances in which a State has
refused to recognize that the naturalization of one of its own
citizens has given rise to a right of diplomatic protection, or in
which it has refused to treat naturalization as exempting him
from the obligations incident to his original citizenship, such as
military service.

But the problems presented by conflicting claims to nationality
and by double nationality do not arise in this case. There can
be no doubt that Mr. Nottebohm lost his German nationality of
origin upon his naturalization in Liechtenstein in October 1939.
I do not think that it is permissible to transfer criteria designed
for cases of double nationality to an essentially different type of
relationship.

There are other difficulties presented by the link theory. In
the case of Mr. Nottebohm, it relies upon a finding of fact that
there is nothing to indicate that his application for naturalization
abroad was motivated by any desire to break his ties with the
Government of Germany. I am unable to concur in making this
finding at the present stage in the case. He had no ties with the
Government of Germany, although there is abundant evidence
to the effect that he had links with the country, as distinct from
the Government. There are substantial difficulties which need to
be considered.


origin. It is noteworthy that in the United Kingdom the policy
of recognizing the automatic loss of British nationality on natura-
lization abroad, which had been adopted in 1870, was abandoned
in 1948. Under the new British legislation, on naturalization
abroad, a British citizen normally maintains his ties with his
country of origin.

In the fourth place, I am unable to agree that there is nothing
to indicate that Mr. Nottebohm’s naturalization was motivated
by a desire to break his ties with Germany. There are three facts
which prove that he was determined to break his ties with Ger-
many. The first is the fact of his application for naturalization,
the second is the taking of his oath of allegiance to Liechten-
stein, and the third is his obtaining a certificate of naturalization

It is also suggested that the naturalization of Mr. Nottebohm was
lacking in genuineness, and did not give rise to a right of protection,
because of his subsequent conduct: that he did not abandon
his residence and his business activities in Guatemala, establish
a business in Liechtenstein, and take up permanent residence.
Along the same lines, it is suggested that he did not incorporate
himself in the body politic which constitutes the Liechtenstein
State.

In considering this point, it is necessary to bear in mind that
there is no rule of international law which would justify me in
taking into account subsequent conduct as relevant to the validity
and opposability of naturalization. Nevertheless I am unable to
avoid consideration of his conduct since October 1939.

I have difficulty in accepting the position taken with regard to
the nature of the State and the incorporation of an individual in
the State by naturalization. To my mind the State is a concept
broad enough to include not merely the territory and its inhabitants
but also those of its citizens who are resident abroad but linked
to it by allegiance. Most States regard non-resident citizens as
a part of the body politic. In the case of many countries such as
China, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the
non-resident citizens form an important part of the body politic
and are numbered in their hundreds of thousands or millions.
Many of these non-resident citizens have never been within the
confines of the home State. I can see no reason why the pattern
of the body politic of Liechtenstein should or must be different
from that of other States.

In my opinion Mr. Nottebohm incorporated himself in the non-
resident part of the body politic of Liechtenstein. From the instant
of his naturalization to the date of the Judgment of this Court,
he has not departed in his conduct from the position of a member
of the Liechtenstein State. He began by obtaining a passport
in October 193g and a visa from the Consulate of Guatemala. On
his arrival in Guatemala in January 1940, he immediately informed
the Guatemalan Government and had himself registered as a
citizen of Liechtenstein. Upon his arrest in October 1943, he obtain-
ed the diplomatic protection of Liechtenstein through the medium
of the Swiss Consul. On the commencement of the confiscation of
his properties, he obtained diplomatic protection from the same
source and channel. After his release from internment he was
accorded full civil rights by the Government of thé United States
of America and instituted and successfully maintained proceedings
and negotiations in Washington with a view to obtaining the


45. NOTTEBOHM CASE (DISS. OPIN. OF JUDGE READ)

release of assets which had been blocked, upon the ground that he
was a national of Liechtenstein. During the last nine years he has
been an active and resident member of the body politic of that
State.

Further, I have difficulty in accepting two closely related findings
of fact. The first is that the naturalization did not alter the manner
of life of Mr. Nottebohm. In my opinion, a naturalization which
led ultimately to his permanent residence in the country of his
allegiance altered the manner of life of a merchant who had hitherto
been residing in and conducting his business activities in Guatemala.



The second finding is that the naturalization was conferred in
exceptional circumstances of speed and accommodation. There are
many countries, beside Liechtenstein, in which expedition and
good will are regarded as administrative virtues. I do not think
that these qualities impair the effectiveness or genuineness of their
administrative acts.

*

The link theory has been based on the view that the essential
character of naturalization and the relation between a State
and its national justify the conclusion that the naturalization of
Mr. Nottebohm, though valid, was unreal and incapable of giving
rise to the right of diplomatic protection. I have difficulty in adopt-
ing this view and it becomes necessary to consider the nature of
naturalization and diplomatic protection and the juridical character
of the relationships which arose between Guatemala and Liech-
tenstein on Mr. Nottebohm’s return in 1940.

Nationality, and the relation between a citizen and the State
to which he owes allegiance, are of such a character that they
demand certainty. When one considers the occasions for invoking
the relationship—emigration and immigration ; travel ; treason ;
exercise of political rights and functions ; military service and the
like—it becomes evident that certainty is essential. There must
be objective tests, readily established, for the existence and recog-
nition of the status. That is why the practice of States has stead-
fastly rejected vague and subjective tests for the right to confer

It is suggested that Mr. Nottebohm obtained his naturalization
with the sole motive of avoiding the legal consequences of his
nationality of origin. He was a German and Germany was at war,
but not with Guatemala. There can be little doubt that this was
one of his motives, but whether it was his sole motive is a matter
of speculation.

There is apparently abundant evidence on this aspect of the
case to which I have not had access ; evidence which would prove
or disprove the contention that the naturalization was part of a
: fraudulent scheme. But it is not permissible for me to look at
that evidence in dealing with a plea in bar. I must proceed at
this stage on the assumption that the naturalization was obtained
in good faith and without fraud.

It has been complained that the purpose of the naturalization
was to avoid the operation of war-time measures in the event that
Guatemala ultimately became involved in war with Germany. In



October 1939, if Mr. Nottebohm read the newspapers—which is
highly probable—he knew that Guatemala, in concert with the
other Pan-American States, was making every effort to maintain
neutrality. It is far more likely that, remembering the experience
of Nottebohm Hermanos during the first World War, he was
seeking to protect his assets in the United States. The suggestion
that he foresaw Guatemalan belligerency is not supported by any
evidence and I cannot accept it.

Further, even if his main purpose had been to protect his
property and business in the event of Guatemalan belligerency,
I do not think that it affected the validity or opposability of the
naturalization. There was no rule of international law and no
rule in the laws of Guatemala at the time forbidding such a course
of action. Mr. Nottebohm did not conceal the naturalization and
informed the Government of Guatemala on the highest level on
his return to the country.

I do not think that I am justified in taking Mr. Nottebohm’s
motives into consideration—in the absence of fraud or injury to
Guatemala—but even if this particular motive is considered, it
cannot be regarded as preventing the existence of the right of
diplomatic protection.

In view of the foregoing circumstances it is necessary for me
to reach the conclusion that the two Parties before the Court
were right in adopting the position that the right of Liechtenstein
to determine under its own law that Mr. Nottebohm was its own
national, and the correlative obligation of Guatemala to recognize
the Liechtenstein law in this regard are limited not by rigid rules
