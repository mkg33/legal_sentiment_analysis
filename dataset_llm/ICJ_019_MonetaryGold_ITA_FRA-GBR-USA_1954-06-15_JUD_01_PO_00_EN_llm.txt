At the present stage of the case the Court must adjudicate upon
the validity of this Submission presented by Italy ; certain special
features of the proceedings, however, make necessary a preliminary
examination of the questions raised by the Submissions of the
United Kingdom.

Of the three respondent Governments, the Governments of the
French Republic and of the United States of America, without
going beyond certain general observations with regard to the solu-
tion of the questions now before-the Court, expressed a desire that
the Court should decide the merits of the case which had been
referred to it.

As regards the United Kingdom Government, it saw in the
challenge to the Court’s jurisdiction made by Italy a ground for
questioning the validity of the Application. Its main Submissions
seek a declaration by the Court that

“(1) in view of Italy’s objection on the ground of the alleged

lack of competence of the Court, her Application to the Court
of May 19th, 1953,

(a) does not conform to the conditions and intentions of the
Tripartite Washington Statement of April 25th, 1951, or

alternatively

(b, has been in effect withdrawn or cancelled by Italy, and is
therefore invalid and void ;

(2) Italy is, in the circumstances, to be deemed not to have
made any application to the Court within the meaning and for
the purposes of the Tripartite Washington Statement.”

With these Submissions of the United Kingdom there should
be contrasted the last Italian Submission formulated by Counsel
for the Italian Government at the hearing on May 13th, 1954:



“That the Court, whatever may be its decision on the question
of jurisdiction referred to above, is without jurisdiction to adju-
dicate upon the claims contained in No. 1 and No. 2 of the Submis-
sions of the Government of the United Kingdom, dated March 26th,

1954.”

In its Observations and Submissions on the Preliminary Question,
the United Kingdom Government asked the Court to find that,
in view of the Preliminary Objection raised by the Italian Govern-
ment, the Application did not conform or no longer conformed to
the conditions and intentions of the Washington Statement ; that
there was no longer any Application before the Court and that
Italy must be considered as not having made an Application,
in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Statement:
The second Submission was explicit :

“(2) That, in consequence, the United Kingdom is entitled by
the Tripartite Washington Statement to receive a transfer of the
gold in the same manner as if Italy, as well as Albania, had not
applied to the Court under the relevant provisions of the State-
ment.”

This Submission threw light upon the intention of the previous
Submission ; but it was not reproduced in the final Submissions,
and the Court is consequently not called upon to deal with it.

There remain, however, the United Kingdom's final Submissions
(x) and (2), of which the wording has been modified in relation
to the Submissions of the United Kingdom as stated in its written
Observations, though the sense and scope remain unchanged ; it
is therefore reasonable to assume that the third Italian final
Submission applies to the altered Submissions of the United
Kingdom.

The Italian Government contends that the Court has no juris-
diction to adjudicate upon these Submissions of the United King-
dom. The Court cannot consider itself as lacking jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon the validity, withdrawal or cancellation of an
application which has been submitted to it : to adjudicate upon
such questions with a view to deciding upon the effect to be given
to the Application falls within the purview of its judicial task.

It is indeed unusual that a State which has submitted a claim
by the filing of an Application should subsequently challenge the
jurisdiction of the Court to which of its own accord it has applied.
In the present case it is Italy which, after having seised the Court,
has raised an issue as to the Court’s jurisdiction. This is, however,
to be understood in the light of the circumstances of the case.
The three Governments which signed the Washington Statement
made a collective offer in respect of the present proceedings, and
Italy accepted that offer. It was in that Statement that the subject-
matter of the suit was pre-determined and it was in the same
Statement that the three Governments accepted as defendants



the jurisdiction of the Court. In these circumstances, Italy, after
having taken the initial step, felt some doubt as to whether the
subject-matter of the dispute was such that the Court could deal
with it. She finally raised the issue in the form of a genuine
Preliminary Objection.

Article 62 of the Rules is couched in terms which do not limit
to the Respondent the right to present preliminary objections.
This Article does not preclude the raising of a Preliminary Objection
by an Applicant in circumstances such as those in which the
present case has arisen. The Preliminary Objection of Italy is
therefore not contrary to the Rules or to the Statute.

The United Kingdom contends that in consequence of Italy's
objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, her Application does
not conform to the conditions and intentions of the Washington
Statement. In support of this contention, the Agent of the United
Kingdom Government advanced certain arguments: First, the
unequivocal acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction by Italy is one
of the conditions in the Washington Statement ; in view of her
preliminary objection, her acceptance of jurisdiction could not
be considered as unequivocal. Second, another condition in the
Washington Statement is that Italy could only make an application
for the determination of certain questions ; but Italy is now
suggesting that the Court should not determine those questions.
Third, under the Washington Statement, Italy's Application
should be a real one ; it is not real because of her objection to
jurisdiction.

The Court finds that Italy’s acceptance of jurisdiction is one
thing, while her raising of a legal issue on jurisdiction is quite
another. It cannot be inferred from the making of the Preliminary
Objection that Italy's acceptance of jurisdiction has become less
complete or less positive than was contemplated in the Washington
Statement. She continues to hold herself out as being subject to
the Court’s jurisdiction in these proceedings after the raising of
the Preliminary Objection as much as she did before taking that
step. The same considerations apply to her request for the deter-
mination of the questions submitted in her Application. She has
requested the Court to settle the problem of jurisdiction before
determining those questions. This does not mean that she is asking
the Court not to determine those questions under any circum-
stances. As to the real character of Italy’s Application, the Court
has only to observe that her Application, once properly deposited,
must be considered as real and as remaining real unless it is
formally withdrawn.

Consequently, the Court cannot accept the contention of the
United Kingdom regarding non-conformity of the Application
with the conditions and intentions of the Washington Statement.



Nor can the Court accept the contention in final Submission
No. 1 (b) of the United Kingdom that the Application has been
in effect withdrawn or cancelled by Italy. Article 69 of the Rules
deals with the case where, in the course of proceedings instituted
by an Application, the Applicant informs the Court in writing
that it is not going on with the proceedings; in this event the
provisions of Article 69 apply. The raising of the Preliminary
Question by Italy cannot be regarded as equivalent to a dis-
continuance.

As to the Submission that the Italian Application should be
held to be “invalid and void”, it is enough to state that the
Application, if not invalid at the time when it was filed, cannot
subsequently have become invalid by reason of the preliminary
question which Italy raised with regard to the Court’s jurisdiction
in this case.

The Court accordingly finds that it has been validly seised of
the Application and that this Application, contrary to the sub-
missions of the United Kingdom Government, still subsists. There-
fore, the Court must now proceed to consideration of the Prelim-
inary Objection of Italy in order to decide whether it can adju-
dicate upon the merits of the claims set forth in the Application.

The Preliminary Objection raised by Italy assumes precise form
in the main Submission by which the Court is asked

“To adjudge and declare:

That the Statement to accompany publication of the Agreement
between the Governments of the French Republic, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of Ameriea for the submission to an arbitrator of certain
claims with respect to gold looted by the Germans from Rome in
1043 is not a sufficient basis upon which to found the jurisdiction
of the Court to deal with the merits of the claim set forth under
No. 1 of the Submissions of the Application submitted to the Court
by the Government of the Italian Republic on May 1gth, 1953;

That the Court is consequently without jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the merits of the said claim.”

On the other hand, the United Kingdom Government, in its
alternative Submission, asks the Court to adjudge and declare

“that, if the Court holds, contrary to the contentions of the United
Kingdom, that the Italian Application is still valid and subsisting,
the Court has jurisdiction to determine on their merits the questions
put to the Court in the Italian Application”.



The Italian Government, in making its Application, stated that
it was relying on the provisions of paragraph (b) of the Washington
Statement. The subject-matter of the suit is the same as that
defined in the Statement. The Parties against whom the suit was
brought, namely France, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America, are those who have declared that they accept
the jurisdiction of the Court for the purpose of the determination
of Italy’s Application. The three States have not named any
other Party in the Statement “for the determination of the
question” relating to Italy’s claim to the delivery of the gold.
The Court notes therefore that in respect of the relations between
these three States and Italy the Application is in conformity
with the offer made in the Washington Statement.

The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America, and the Government of Italy, by their
separate and successive acts—the adoption of the Washington
Statement, in the one case, and in the other case, the deposit
on May 19th, 1953, of the Declaration of acceptance of the
jurisdiction of the Court and the filing of the Application—have
referred a case to the Court within the meaning of Article 36 (1)
of its Statute. They have thus conferred jurisdiction on the Court
to deal with the questions submitted in the Application of the
Italian Government.

The Court must, however, examine whether this jurisdiction
is co-extensive with the task entrusted to it. The Agent of the
United Kingdom Government stated during the oral proceedings
that :

“Albania’s consent is not, in our view, necessary to the deter-
mination of the questions affecting Italy under head (b) of the
Washington Statement, because the only issue raised under that
head—a decision on which by the Court would be binding on the
Parties to it—is the question of whether Albania’s share should
go to the United Kingdom or to Italy ; and both those countries,
as well as the two remaining Washington Governments, have
given their consent and are before the Court.”

This seems to be an over-simplification of the problem with which
the Court is confronted. The Court is not merely called upon to
say whether the gold should be delivered to Italy or to the United
Kingdom: It is requested to determine first certain legal questions
upon the solution of which depends the delivery of the gold.

By the first claim in the Application the Court is requested to
decide that the three respondent States ‘should deliver to Italy any
share of the monetary gold that might be due to Albania under
Part ITI of the Paris Act of January 14th, 1946, in partial satisfaction
for the damage caused to Italy by the Albanian law of January 13th,
1945”. The Washington Statement specified in advance one of the



purposes of Italy’s Application, namely, the “determination of the
question whether, by reason of any right which she claims to possess
as a result of the Albanian law of 13th January, 1945, or under the
provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, the gold should be delivered
to Italy rather than to Albania”. The Court will not deal with the
Italian Peace Treaty since its provisions have not been invoked
during the present proceedings.

The first Submission in the Application centres around a claim by
Italy against Albania, a claim to indemnification for an alleged
wrong. Italy believes that she possesses a right against Albania for the
redress of an international wrong which, according to Italy, Albania
has committed against her. In order, therefore, to determine whether
Italy is entitled to receive the gold, it is necessary to determine
whether Albania has committed any international wrong against
Italy, and whether she is under an obligation to pay compensation
to her ; and, if so, to determine also the amount of compensation.
In order to decide such questions, it is necessary to determine
whether the Albanian law of January 13th, 1945, was contrary to
international law. In the determination of these questions—ques-
tions which relate to the lawful or unlawful character of certain
actions of Albania vis-a-vis Italy—only two States, Italy and
Albania, are directly interested. To go into the merits of such ques-
tions would be to decide a dispute between Italy and Albania.

The Court cannot decide such a dispute without the consent of
Albania. But it is not contended by any Party that Albania has
given her consent in this case either expressly or by implication. To
adjudicate upon the international responsibility of Albania without
her consent would run counter to a well-established principle of
international law embodied in the Court’s Statute, namely, that the
Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a State with its consent.

It has been suggested that Albania might have intervened. The
provisions of Article 62 of the Statute give to a third State, which
considers that it “has an interest of a legal nature which may be
affected by the decision in the case”, the right to request permission
to intervene. It has been contended that the inclusion of the provi-
sions for intervention indicate that the Statute contemplates that
proceedings may continue, notwithstanding that a third State may
have an interest of a legal nature which might enable it to intervene.
It is argued that the fact that a third State, in this case Albania,
may not choose to intervene should not make it impossible for the
Court to give judgment on rights as between the Parties.

Albania has not submitted a request to the Court to be permitted
to intervene. In the present case, Albania’s legal interests would
not only be affected by a decision, but would form the very
subject-matter of the decision. In such a case, the Statute cannot
be regarded, by implication, as authorizing proceedings to be
continued in the absence of Albania.



It is also contended that any decision of the Court on the ques-
tions submitted by Italy in her Application will be binding only
upon Italy and the three respondent States, and not upon Albania.
It is true that, under Article 59 of the Statute, the decision of the
Court in a given case only binds the parties to it and in respect of
that particular case. This rule, however, rests on the assumption
that the Court is at least able to render a binding decision. Where,
as in the present case, the vital issue to be settled concerns the inter-
national responsibility of a third State, the Court cannot, without
the consent of that third State, give a decision on that issue
binding upon any State, either the third State, or any of the
parties before it.

The Court accordingly finds that, although Italy and the three
respondent States have conferred jurisdiction upon the Court, it
cannot. exercise this jurisdiction to adjudicate on the first claim
submitted by Italy.

*
* *

The Court will now consider whether it can adjudicate upon the
second claim in the Italian Application. This claim, which is also
based on the Washington Statement, is that “Italy’s right to receive
the said share of monetary gold must have priority over the claim
of the United Kingdom to receive the gold in partial satisfaction of
the Judgment in the Corfu Channel case”.

It might seem that the second claim, unlike the first, only con-
cerns Italy and the United Kingdom, both of whom have already
accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. According to the Washington
Statement, however, the question of priority between the claim of
Italy and that of the United Kingdom will only arise when it has
been decided that, as between Italy and Albania, the gold should
go to Italy. For the words ‘“if this issue [the issue of priority] should
arise” used in the Statement could only mean that the issue of
priority would call for a decision only if the Court had already
decided that Italy had a valid claim to the gold in question against
Albania, thus creating, in the minds of the three Governments, a
competitive claim with the claim of the United Kingdom.

The dependence of the second claim upon the first is confirmed
by the Italian Submission itself. When the Italian Government
speaks of ‘’Italy’s right to receive the said share of monetary gold”,
it is not referring to any hypothetical right : it must be referring to
a right which it believes it possesses and which, by the first Submis-
sion in its Application, it requests the Court to uphold.

This dependence is further borne out by the statements made by
the Parties in the course of the written and oral proceedings. In the
document deposited on October 30th, 1653, in which the Italian
Government raised the Preliminary Question, it is stated that the



second question submitted in its Application will only arise in the
event that the Court has decided on the merits of the first question,
as requested by the Italian Government. The United Kingdom
Government, in its Observations and Submissions on the Prelimi-
nary Question, also said that the priority issue could only arise if
the Court went into the question of Italy’s claim against Albania,
and decided that in favour of Italy. At the hearings, Counsel for
the Italian Government and the Agent of the United Kingdom
Government both spoke in a similar vein.

Counsel for the Italian Government added, however, that “if the
Court considers that the question of priority between the respective
rights of the United Kingdom and Italy can be examined in a hypo-
thetical form, independently of the examination of the first Italian
claim, the Italian Government, for its part, would have no objec-
tion”. Apart from the fact that this statement, which is conditional
in form, can hardly be construed as a formal request for consider-
ation by the Court of the second claim on a hypothetical basis, it
would, in any event, constitute a new proposition which is not based
on the Washington Statement and to which the respondent States
have not expressed agreement. It is evident that the Court could
not act upon such a proposition.

The Court accordingly finds that inasmuch as it cannot adjudicate
on the first Italian claim, it must refrain from examining the ques-
tion of priority between the claim of Italy and that of the United
Kingdom.

For these reasons,

THE COURT,
unanimously,

finds that the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the common
agreement of France, the United Kingdom, the United States of
America and Italy does not, in the absence of the consent of Albania,
authorize it to adjudicate upon the first Submission in the Applica-
tion of the Italian Government ;

by thirteen votes to one,

finds that it cannot adjudicate upon the second Submission in
the Application of the Italian Government.

Sir Arnold McNaIr, President, after voting for the Judgment,
made the following declaration :

I concur in the finding of the Court that it is unable to adjudicate
upon the two questions submitted to it by the Application of the
Italian Government, but the reasons which have led me to this
conclusion are different from those stated in the judgment of the
Court. In my opinion, there is a fundamental defect in the Applica-
tion and in the constitution of these proceedings. The Court is asked
to adjudicate upon an Italian claim against Albania arising out of
an Albanian law of January 13th, 1945. Albania is therefore an
essential respondent. But these proceedings are not brought against
Albania, nor does the Application name Albania as a respondent,
although there is nothing in the Washington Statement which could
preclude the Italian Government from making Albania a respondent.
I cannot see how State A, desiring the Court to adjudicate upon its
claim against State B, can validly seise the Court of that claim
unless it makes State B a respondent to the proceedings—however
many other States may be respondents.



Judge READ, availing himself of the right conferred on him
by Article 57 of the Statute, appends to the Judgment a statement
of his individual opinion.

Judge Levi CARNEIRO, availing himself of the right conferred
