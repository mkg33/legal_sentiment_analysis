In addition to the joint declaration, which reflects my disagreement
with the grounds which led the Court to conclude that it had no jurisdic-
tion in the instant case, I deem it necessary to elaborate further on some
aspects. At the outset, I would like to emphasize that regardless of the
conclusion that the Court reaches on the issue of jurisdiction, and not-
withstanding the fact that the Judgment is confined to deciding on juris-
diction, the Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,
is always called upon to uphold the law of the Charter. The Court, how-
ever, confined its conclusion in the instant case to noting, in para-
graph 128 of the Judgment, that:

“When, however, as in the present case, the Court comes to the
conclusion that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the claims made
in the Application, it can make no finding, nor any observation
whatever, on the question whether any such violation has been com-
mitted or any international responsibility incurred.”

On this point I am inclined to favour the balance reached by the Court in
the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, where it held that:

“55. There is a fundamental distinction between the acceptance
by a State of the Court’s jurisdiction and the compatibility of par-
ticular acts with international law. The former requires consent. The
latter question can only be reached when the Court deals with the
merits, after having established its jurisdiction and having heard full
legal argument by both parties.

56. Whether or not States accept the jurisdiction of the Court,
they remain in all cases responsible for acts attributable to them that
violate the rights of other States.” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.
Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 456.)

1. The Court finds that it has no jurisdiction in this case because the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)! did not have access to the Court
at the time it filed its Application. The first ground upon which the
Court makes this finding is Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
Court.

2. Article 35, paragraph 1, provides that “[t]he Court shall be open to
the States parties to the present Statute”. Under Article 93, paragraph 1,
of the United Nations Charter, all “Members of the United Nations are
ipso facto [States] parties”. The Court holds that the FRY was not a
State party to the Statute because the FRY was not a Member of the
United Nations at the time it filed its Application in the instant case, and
therefore, in the view of the Court, the Court was not “open” to the
FRY. Because, in my view, the FRY was a Member of the United
Nations when it filed its Application, I disagree.

4, The FRY came into being on 27 April 1992. On that date, a joint
session of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia and the
Assembly of the Republic of Montenegro proclaimed a new constitution
of the “Federal Republic of Yugoslavia”, and also adopted a Declara-
tion. The preamble of the Declaration claimed to reflect the common will
of the citizens of Serbia and Montenegro “to stay in the common State of
Yugoslavia”, and also provided that:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continuing the state, inter-
national, legal and political personality of the [Socialist Federal
Republic] of Yugoslavia, shall strictly abide by all the commitments
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed interna-
tionally.

and institutions whose member it is, the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia shall not obstruct the newly formed states to join these organi-
sations and institutions, particularly the United Nations and its
specialised agencies.”

6. In September 1992, the Security Council and the General Assembly
each adopted a resolution declaring “that the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the mem-
bership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the
United Nations” 4. These resolutions did not suspend the membership of
the FRY in the United Nations in accordance with Article 5 of the Char-
ter. Nor did either resolution have the effect of expelling the FRY from
the United Nations in accordance with Article 6 of the Charter. Earlier,
the Council, on 30 May 1992, had adopted a resolution® imposing eco-
nomic and other sanctions on the FRY — meaning that the conditions
for invoking the provisions of Article 6 existed — yet the FRY was not
expelled.

7. This fact was recognized by the United Nations Legal Counsel, who
on 29 September 1992, addressed a letter to the Permanent Representa-
tives of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which the “considered

view of the United Nations Secretariat regarding the practical conse-


“While the General Assembly has stated unequivocally that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot
automatically continue the membership of the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations and that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should
apply for membership in the United Nations, the only practical
consequence that the resolution draws is that the Federal Repub-
lic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall not participate
in the work of the General Assembly. It is clear, therefore, that
representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) can no longer participate in the work of the General
Assembly, its subsidiary organs, nor conferences and meetings con-

vened by it.
On the other hand, the resolution neither terminates nor suspends
Yugoslavia’s membership in the Organization . . . The resolution

does not take away the right of Yugoslavia to participate in the
work of organs other than Assembly bodies.” $

10. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY), when it also considered the question whether the FRY was a
member of the United Nations during this period, reached the same con-
clusion. It held that:

“Resolution 47/1 did not deprive the FRY of all the attributes of
United Nations membership: the only practical consequence was its
inability to participate in the work of the General Assembly, its sub-
sidiary organs, conferences or meetings convened by it. Apart from
that, it continued to function as a member of the United Nations in
many areas of the work of the United Nations . . . Thus, while the
FRY’s membership was lost for certain purposes, it was retained for
others . . . The proper approach to the issue of the FRY membership
of the United Nations in the period between 1992 and 2000 is not
one that proceeds on a[n] a priori, doctrinaire assumption that its
exclusion from participation in the work of the General Assembly
necessarily meant that it was no longer a member of the United
Nations. As the FRY membership was neither terminated nor sus-
pended by General Assembly resolution 47/1, it is more appropriate
to make a determination of its United Nations membership in that
period on an empirical, functional and case-by-case basis.” 8

13. The Court has now characterized the FRY’s sui generis position as
one that “could not have amounted to its membership in the Organiza-
tion” (Judgment, para. 78) and held that the FRY’s admission to the
United Nations in 2000 “did not have and could not have had, the effect
of dating back to the time when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia broke up and disappeared” (ibid. ). This, in my view, lacks a solid
legal basis. Whereas the Security Council and General Assembly were
acting in a political capacity when the relevant resolutions were adopted,
the Court, throughout the various phases of the cases related to the
former Yugoslavia, should have consistently stated and applied the appli-

1. The FRY did not invoke Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s
Statute as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. The Court decided proprio
motu to address it!?, holding that the FRY, as a non-party to the Statute,
could not invoke a treaty which entered into force after the entry into
force of the Statute as a basis for access to the Court under Article 35,
paragraph 2. I have explained the reasons for my disagreement with the
Court’s conclusion that the FRY was not a Member of the United
Nations in 1999. However, assuming that it was a non-Member, I also
cannot agree that it would not have access to the Court under the pro-
visions of Article 35, paragraph 2.

4. In respect of the first question, I agree with the Court’s previous
finding that

“proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,
LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 19; emphasis added) !3.

7. Even assuming — without deciding # — that the Court is correct in
holding that the term “treaties in force” should be given a more restric-
tive interpretation than the interpretation it is given when it appears in
Articles 36 and 37, in my view the interpretation adopted by the Court —
limiting “treaties in force” to treaties in force at the time the Court’s
Statute came into force — is unduly restrictive.


11. By analogy, in the context of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War, the
Genocide Convention can be considered a treaty connected with the
peace settlement. Barely a year after the end of the war, there was already
a General Assembly resolution!” mandating the Economic and Social
Council to prepare a draft convention prohibiting genocide as a crime
against international law. The Convention was the first post-war treaty in
the area of human rights and was considered to be the United Nations’

1. The Court found that the FRY did not have access to the
Court and the Court did not therefore consider it necessary to decide
whether the FRY was or was not a party to the Genocide Convention
at the time it filed its Application. In my view, the FRY did have access
to the Court under the provisions of Article 35 and I shall proceed to

examine the Genocide Convention as a basis for the Court’s jurisdic-

of Treaties. Article 17, paragraph 1, provides that

“a newly independent State may, by a notification of succession,
establish its status as a party to any multilateral treaty which at the
date of the succession of States was in force in respect of the terri-
tory to which the succession of States relates”.

Article 34 of the Vienna Convention, on the other hand, provides that

“[w]lhen a part or parts of the territory of a State separate to form
one or more States, whether or not the predecessor State continues
to exist:

(a) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect of the entire territory of the predecessor State continues
in force in respect of each successor State so formed[, and]

(b) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect only of that part of the territory of the predecessor State
which has become a successor State continues in force in respect
of that successor State alone”.

tomary [international] law” (Gabëikovo-Nagymaros Project ( Hungary!
Slovakia), Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1997, p. 62, para. 99)3 and recent
State practice, for instance in respect of the successors of Czechoslovakia
and the SFRY, lends support to this proposition in respect of the rules
of succession. This is all the more true in cases involving succession
to human rights treaties. In the words of my learned colleague
Judge Weeramantry,

“[it] . . . seems to me to be a principle of contemporary international
law that there is automatic State succession to so vital a human
rights convention as the Genocide Convention . . . [The] reasons [for
applying the principle of automatic succession] apply with special
force to treaties such as the Genocide Convention . . . leaving no
room for doubt regarding automatic succession to such treaties.”
(Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment

However, because I consider that the Court does not have jurisdiction
ratione materiae, 1 find myself in agreement with the dispositif contained
in paragraph 129 of the Judgment, which states that the Court “//Jinds
that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the Application
filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999”. 1 was therefore able
to vote in favour of the Judgment.
