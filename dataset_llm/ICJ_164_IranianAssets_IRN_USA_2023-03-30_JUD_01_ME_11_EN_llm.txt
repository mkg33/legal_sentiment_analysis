      1. I agree with much of the Court’s reasoning in this case. In this separate opinion, I address
two questions on which I differ from the majority.

       2. When discussing Iran’s claims concerning unlawful expropriation under Article IV,
paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity, the Court’s analysis is premised on sound criteria: that the
bona fide non-discriminatory exercise of regulatory powers with a legitimate public welfare purpose
does not give rise to compensation, and that such regulatory powers are not unlimited (Judgment,
para. 185). Yet the Court does not then apply the criteria that it heralds and that are commonly applied
in international practice. Instead, it turns its attention to an enquiry into the unreasonableness of the
United States’ measures. I have no doubt that “[r]easonableness is one of the considerations that limit
the exercise of the governmental powers” (Judgment, para. 186). It does not follow, however, that
(un)reasonableness should displace the elaborate criteria for the assessment whether State regulation
amounts to unlawful expropriation.

       3. The Court relies simply on the breach of Article IV, paragraph 1, to find a breach of
Article IV, paragraph 2. In a few lines in paragraph 186, the Court explains that a finding of breach
in the context of the obligation against unreasonable measures suffices for the conclusion that the
obligation against unlawful expropriation has also been breached. In my view, it is not obvious that
the applicable standard under the two obligations is identical, nor that breach of one will necessarily
entail breach of the other. As the Court acknowledges in its discussion of the claim under Article IV,
paragraph 1, reasonableness is highly contextual (Judgment, para. 146).

       4. I note that international jurisprudence tends to recognize that the domestic regulator is vested
with a measure of discretion in this connection. In the case of Philip Morris v. Uruguay, for example,
the tribunal’s finding that the impugned measures were adopted in good faith, directed at the
legitimate public welfare aim of public health protection and capable of contributing to its
achievement, was sufficient to defeat a claim of unlawful expropriation 1. It is up to Iran to
demonstrate that the United States’ measures “‘crosse[d] the line’ that separates valid regulatory
activity from expropriation” 2. In my view Iran has not done so here.

      5. I am also unable to agree with the Court’s finding that a series of measures adopted by the
United States violated its obligations under Article X, paragraph 1.

     6. Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity provides: “Between the territories of the two
High Contracting Parties there shall be freedom of commerce and navigation.” I share the Court’s

endorsement of the broad interpretation of Article X, paragraph 1, adopted in Oil Platforms
(Judgment, para. 212). I would add that this provision prohibits not only acts impeding commerce
but also any act that would impede the freedom of commerce 3.

       7. The Court has also, however, identified limits on the scope of Article X, paragraph 1. In the
merits phase of Oil Platforms, the Court insisted that there be evidence of “an actual impediment
[une entrave effective] to commerce or navigation” 4. It rejected the United States’ claim of a breach
of that provision for lack of evidence that there were actual breaches of commerce or navigation
between the territories of the United States and Iran.

      8. Following the same approach in this case, the question is whether the United States’
measures created an actual impediment to commerce between the Parties. The Court points to three
instances of legal interference with commerce between the Parties: Executive Order 13599’s
blocking of property and interests in property; the FSIA’s subjection to attachment and execution of
the assets of any Iranian company in which the State holds an interest; and the enforcement
proceedings with respect to contractual debts in the telecommunications industry and in the credit
card services sector (Judgment, paras. 220-222).

       9. In my view, however, Iran did not produce adequate evidence to establish its claim. Many
types of governmental action will affect the conduct of commerce in a multitude of ways. Article X,
paragraph 1, cannot be taken to preclude activities that are a regular feature of commercial life, such
as the enforcement of judgment debts. It can also not be taken to preclude any regulatory measure
that may have indirect or incidental effects on commerce. As the Court held in the preliminary
objections phase of the present case, “freedom of commerce cannot cover matters that have no
connection, or too tenuous a connection, with the commercial relations between the States Parties to
the Treaty” 5.

       10. For that reason, I am not convinced by the Court’s terse finding that Executive Order 13599
and Section 1610 (g) (1) of the FSIA constituted actual impediments to commerce “by [their] own
terms” (Judgment, paras. 220-221). As my votes show, I think that the enactment of these measures
violated other provisions of the Treaty of Amity. It does not follow, however, that those measures
were also in breach of Article X, paragraph 1.
