1. Pakistan's attitude with regard to the Court’s jurisdiction has under-
gone a progressive change.

At the meeting of the ICAO Council on 18 October 1971, the Chief
Counsel of Pakistan, Mr. Pirzada, maintained that “the Appeal by India
in respect of our Complaint filed under Section 1 of Article II of the
Transit Agreement is incompetent” and that his Government reserved
the right “to raise these issues and objections as to competency thereof

Appeal relating 10 the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council.



before the International Court of Justice at the appropriate time”
(Rejoinder of Pakistan, para. 40). Such an objection has not been raised.

In the Counter-Memorial, Pakistan claims that Article 36 of the Statute
is irrelevant, in view of the reservation in the Government of India’s
declaration accepting the Court’s jurisdiction, concerning disputes with
States members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Pakistan also claims
that the appeal brought by India against the Council's decision is inad-
missible because it is Section | and not Section 2 of Article Il of the Agree-
ment which should be applied (Counter-Memorial of Pakistan, paras.
24 and 25).

In the Rejoinder of Pakistan, some of India’s assertions are disputed,
but on the jurisdiction of the Court it is confined to a simple affirmation
that “the decision of the Council on any matter relating to a Complaint
is not subject to appeal” (Rejoinder, para. 40).

It was at the public sitting of 27 June 1972 that Pakistan's Chief Coun-
sel before the Court, Mr. Bakhtiar, denied that the Court had jurisdic-
tion to determine India’s appeal against the decision of the Council on
its own jurisdiction. Up to that point, Pakistan had disputed the pos-
sibility of appeal against the Council's decision with regard to the
Transit Agreement (Art. IT, Sec. 1), but had not advanced any argument
against the possibility of appeal against the Council’s decision concerning
the dispute indicated in Pakistan’s Application, to the extent that that
dispute related to the Convention (Art. 84).

Despite this procedural irregularity, the Court must deal explicitly with
its own jurisdiction since this has been called in question.

2. Appeal does not lie against a complaint based on Section 1 of Ar-
ticle IT of the Agreement, because it does not lead to a decision of the
Council, but to consultations and recommendations to the parties and—
if the contracting State concerned unreasonably fails to take suitable
corrective action—to possible recommendations to the Assembly. But
appeal does lie against the Council's decision on its own jurisdiction to
deal with a disagreement concerning the Transit Agreement, because
Pakistan based its claims, in reply to India’s objection, on Article 84 of
the Convention and Article IT, Section 2, of the Agreement.

India’s preliminary objection, by its very nature, prevented the Com-
plaint being dealt with on the basis of Section 1 of Article IT of the Agree-
ment. What was argued was not the action taken by India, but the Coun-
cil’s jurisdiction to examine such action. It thus follows that in the Coun-
cil the discussion was centred on the interpretation of treaties in general,
and that of the Convention and the Agreement in particular (see the
remarks of Mr. Pirzada, Annex E to the Memorial of India, (b), Dis-
cussion, paras. 25 ff., (c), Discussion, paras. 28 ff.). In Pakistan’s reply
to India’s preliminary objections, the following passages may be found:


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 118

“There exists a disagreement between India and Pakistan relating
to the interpretation or application of the Convention and the Tran-
sit Agreement” (Annex D to the Memorial of India, para. 11 (a)).

“Pakistan's Application is within the scope of Article 84 of the
Convention, Article II (2) of the Transit Agreement and Article 1
(1) of the Rules” (ibid., paras. 25 and 26; see also para. 18).

“The Council has jurisdiction to entertain and decide any dis-
pute regarding the interpretation and/or application of the Con-
vention and the Transit Agreement and to make appropriate findings
and recommendation under the Transit Agreement” (ibid., para. 39

(d)).

The question which was argued in the Council, and decided by it, is
the question of its jurisdiction to interpret the Agreement, taking into
account the objection raised by India !. Once India had raised an objec-
tion, Pakistan's Complaint could not be dealt with under the special
procedure laid down for complaints (Arts. 23 et seq, of the Rules for
the Settlement of Differences). India’s objection changes the nature of
the question laid before the Council. It no longer concerns action taken
by India under the Agreement (Art. II, Sec. 1): from that moment there
is a disagreement as to the possibility of applying the Agreement, as to
its termination or its suspension, and that disagreement implied a further
disagreement as to its interpretation (Art. II, Sec. 2).

that Article 37 is a transitory provision of the Statute, which speaks of
‘‘as between the parties to the present Statute”; but the Statute was pro-
mulgated before Pakistan came into existence (C.R. 72/6, p. 39). In
support of this argument counsel for Pakistan quoted various Judgments
of the Court (/.C.J. Reports 1959, pp. 139, 140, 142; I.C.J. Reports 1961,
pp. 27-32, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 602).

But the expression ‘‘as between the parties to the present Statute’ also
occurs in Article 36, paragraph 5. This provision relates to declarations
made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court, deemed to
be acceptances of the compulsory jurisdiction of the present Court. Ar-
ticle 37 however concerns treaties or conventions in force providing for
reference of a matter to the Permanent Court (the case of Article 84 of
the Convention and Article II, Section 2, of the Agreement).

The Judgments of the Court which Pakistan has quoted relate to the
application of Article 36, paragraph 5, of the Statute, and not Article 37.
The Court’s doctrine on Article 37 is contrary to the argument of Pakis-
tan. The Court, as it has itself stated, cannot ‘accept the dissolution of
the Permanent Court as a cause of lapse or abrogation of any of the juris-
dictional clauses concerned, [and] it must hold that the date at which the
Respondent became a party to the Statute is irrelevant” (I.C.J. Reports
1964, p. 34). “It was not the primary purpose to specify one tribunal
rather than another, but to create an obligation of compulsory adjudi-
cation. (Such an obligation naturally entailed that a forum would be
indicated.) (Ibid., p. 38.) On the dissolution of the Permanent Court,
“another tribunal the [International Court of Justice]... is supplied by the
automatic operation of some ... instrument [the Statute of the Court] by
which both parties are bound”. (Zbid., p. 39.)

Nothing in the argument of Pakistan could justify the Court's reversing
its previous rulings on this point.

4. The kernel of the whole new argument of Pakistan is its interpreta-
tion of Article 84 of the Convention. On this interpretation, the Article
should be applied to final decisions or decisions on the merits—the deci-
sions contemplated by Article 15 of the Rules for the Settlement of Dif-
ferences—, but it does not apply to decisions on preliminary objections,
against which therefore appeal does not lie.

(a) This interpretation is based first of all on the letter of Article 84.
Attention is drawn to the fact that the Article mentions *‘the decison”
of the Council and not “any decision” of the Council; and that “the
word ‘settlement’ ought to mean that when the matter could not be settled
by negotiation then it ought to be decided by the Council” (C.R. 72/6, p.
25). If appeal were allowed—so the argument continues—from any Order
of the Council “that will defeat the very purpose of the Convention”
(ibid., p. 26). However, a reading of Article 84 without any preconceived
view leads us to give it a different meaning. It refers to ‘‘any disagreement”
which cannot be settled by negotiation. It does not of course refer to every
kind of disagreement which could be resolved by an Order. It refers to
disagreements which could be settled by negotiation and which relate to


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP, DE CASTRO) 120

the interpretation or application of the Convention. The number of
possible disagreements is limited, and decisions on these do not include
any kind of Order whatsoever. They must be important decisions, and
decisions of a certain general interest. Decisions on questions of jurisdic-
tion cannot therefore be excluded from this category without specific
reason. Against the over-restrictive interpretation of Article 84 advanced
by Pakistan, it may be observed that Article 86, under the heading “Ap-
peals”, tells us that, apart from decisions on the operation of international
airlines, “on any other matter, decisions of the Council shall, if appealed
from, be suspended”. How can it be conceived that questions relating to
the jurisdiction of the Council were to be excluded from these “other
matters’!? A decision by the Council on its jurisdiction is not just any
sort of Order (comparable, for example, to an Order on the admission
of evidence). It is a final decision and one of general importance if it deals
with a question of interpretation of the Convention. In the Pakistan v.
India case, if the Council upholds India’s preliminary objection, the
procedure is terminated, with the result that Pakistan is finally non-
suited with regard to its Application and Complaint 2.

The disagreement as to the jurisdiction of the Council can be settled
by decision of the Council or by negotiation. The Secretary General of
ICAO, when informing the parties of the Council's decision of 29 July
1971, said that he desired “once more to draw your attention [i.e., the
Parties’ attention] to the Council's resolution of 8 April 1971 in which the
Parties were invited to negotiate” (Annex II to the Counter-Memorial of
Pakistan * *).

(bh) Pakistan’s argument is also based on certain articles of the Coun-
cil’s Rules for the Settlement of Differences. The reasoning may be
summarized as follows: Article 5, on preliminary objections, makes
no mention of appeal. Thus a decision on a preliminary objection is not
a decision against which an appeal lies under Article 18. The decisions

! See also the Note by the Secretary General of ICAO alrcady quoted above
{Annex C to the Reply, footnote).

2 1 see no reason why preliminary objections relating to jurisdiction should be
treated differently according to the decisions taken upon them or why the appeal
should be upheld only when jurisdiction is denied. Such a distinction has no foun-
dation in law. Moreover, a party may have an interest, worthy of protection, in
appealing from the decision dismissing the objection. It may be added that decisions
on objections to jurisdiction are also of general interest since, as judicial decisions,
they may become a source of law.

* Although the jurisdiction of a court is not subject to the will of the parties to
a case, there are possibilities for negotiations concerning jurisdiction. A State may
waive a preliminary objection to jurisdiction, either explicitly or tacitly (forum
prorogatum}, and this may happen as a result of negotiations.

* The phrase in Article 84 ‘Any contracting State may . . . appeal” must be in-
terpreted as giving to ‘‘any contracting State involved in this dispute” the right to
appeal. An appeal is open to the parties to a dispute. Intervention, which is governed
by Article 19 of the Rules, is another matter.


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 121

decision of the Council upholding its own jurisdiction was not provided
for in the Convention: “The reason is the universally established rule
of international law that every international tribunal has the jurisdiction
to determine its own jurisdiction” (C.R. 72/6, p. 28).

But the question of the compétence de la compétence arises when there
are no rules laying down an appeal procedure. When there are rules as
to appeal, the court (or arbitrator) cannot itself decide whether or not it
is possible to appeal against its own decision. Interpretation of the extent
of the rule as to appeal falls within the jurisdiction of the higher court.
The lower court cannot deprive the appeal court of its jurisdiction,
by arrogating to itself the power to give its own interpretation of the rule
as to appeal; its jurisdiction is limited by the possibility of appeal. It is
the higher court which has the jurisdiction to decide on its own jurisdic-
tion, to say on appeal whether, in a given case, it is possible to appeal
against the decision of the lower court.

The Council could not, and did not, give a decision denying India’s
right of appeal to this Court. It is this Court which has jurisdiction to
interpret Article 84 of the Convention, and consequently to say whether or
not India can validly appeal from the Council's decision.


1. It is observed in the Memorial of the Indian Government that
disagreements between States pertaining to the Convention or the Transit
Agreement may arise in one of four ways: (1) disagreements as to inter-
pretation, (2) disagreements as to application, (3) disagreements arising
from action taken under the Convention or the Agreement, and (4)
disagreements pertaining to termination or suspension of the Conven-
tion or the Transit Agreement by one State as against another (Me-
morial of India, para. 72). India then contends that only the first two types
of disagreement can be considered by the Council under the terms of the
Convention, and only the first three types of disagreement can be con-
sidered by the Council as far as the Agreement is concerned. According
to India, the Council is not competent to consider the fourth type of
disagreement, which is concerned with termination or suspension of the
Convention or the Transit Agreement (ibid., para. 73).

As the chief counsel of India said in his address to the Council, this
distinction “is the crux of the case” (Memorial of India, Annex E, (a),
Discussion, para. 7). His argument is that since the text of the treaties
does not use the expressions “suspension” and “termination”, which
have very clear meanings, it must follow that the Council has no juris-
diction in this connection.

India’s argument is based on an incorrect premise, namely, that the
four causes of disagreement are of the same kind, whereas in fact they
are of different kinds.


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 125

Interpretation is a general function and one to be carried out as a
preliminary step. It signifies the search for and ascertainment of the true
meaning of the Convention and the Agreement, with reference to any
action, any situation or any fact. For example, it involves ascertaining
whether the application effected is or is not a correct one, classifying
the actions of States, determining whether they have carried out their
duties or committed any breach of their obligations, and whether the
established reservations in favour of State sovereignty have been re-
spected.

The basic postulate underlying the Indian objections is that the Con-
vention and the Agreement have been terminated or suspended with
regard to Pakistan; Pakistan’s conduct, according to India, implies a
breach of the obligations undertaken by Pakistan, and it is this which is
the cause of the termination or suspension. But to reach such a conclusion
one has to interpret the Convention and the Agreement. To ascertain
whether Pakistan has committed a breach of its obligations towards
India, one needs to know what those obligations are; to ascertain whether
a breach of this category or that gives rise to termination or suspension,
it is necessary to know what are the appropriate sanctions for such a
violation, and what the relevant procedure is for those sanctions to be
imposed. The answer to these questions depends on the meaning (inter-
pretation) of the rules to be applied (the Convention and the Agreement).

In the preliminary objections made by India before the Council (28
March 1971), it is explained that the “policy of political confrontation
bordering on hostility” on the part of Pakistan, and “the hijacking of
an Indian aircraft” were the cause of the termination or suspension of
the Convention and the Agreement, the conduct of Pakistan amounting
“to the very negation of all the aims and objectives, the scheme and
provisions, of the Convention . . . and of the . . . Agreement” (Memorial
of India, Annex C, paras. 5 and 6) 1.

It is apparent that India is offering its own interpretation of the
Convention and the Agreement, that it is putting Pakistan’s conduct in
a particular category, by regarding it as contrary to the aims and objec-
tives, the scheme and provisions, of each of these instruments. As soon
as this interpretation differs from that advanced by Pakistan, there is a
disagreement as to the interpretation of the Convention and the Agree-
ment (Art. 84 of the Convention, Art. IL, Sec. 2, of the Transit Agreement).

The form of words by which jurisdiction is conferred on a body to
settle disputes the subject of which is the interpretation, or the inter-

! It is also stated that “Pakistan by its conduct has repudiated the Convention
vis-a-vis India, since its conduct has militated against the very objectives under-
lying, and the express provisions of, the Convention . .. Pakistan's conduct also
amounts to a repudiation of the Transit Agreement vis-a-vis India. In the circum-
stances, India has accepted the position that the Convention and the Transit Agree-
ment stand repudiated, or in any event suspended, by Pakistan vis-à-vis India”
(Memorial of India, Annex C, para. 22).


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 126

pretation and the application, of a treaty, confers on that body juris-
diction to interpret “all or any provisions [of the Treaty], whether they
relate to substantive obligations” or not (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 343),
which logically includes the legal consequences of the violation of such
obligations (pacta sunt servanda). This is a conclusion which is of general
application, whether the organ having jurisdiction is ICAO or an organ
of another organization 1.

The Indian argument is based on a narrow conception of the word
“interpretation”. “Where such a method of interpretation results in a
meaning incompatible with the spirit, purpose and context of the clause
or instrument in which the words are contained, no reliance can be
validly placed on it” (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 336).

India has advanced a supplemental argument based on the absurdity
of entrusting the settlement of legal questions to the Council. The
Council is composed of persons without legal training; it is composed
not of men but of States; it is an administrative or technical body. It
is therefore not equipped to carry out judicial functions, still less to
decide questions touching the rights of sovereign States. How then can
Article 84 of the Convention and Article II, Section 2, of the Agreement
be understood as conferring power on the Council to pass judgment as
to the termination or suspension of a treaty?

The impression that has thus been given to us of the Council’s functions
is not supported by the Chicago Convention.. The power which the Arti-
cles mentioned confer upon the Council apparently extends to all the
rules contained in the Convention; but the interpretation of the rules
contained in a convention is a legal function, not an administrative func-
tion. The Council have to decide disputes between States as to the inter-
pretation and application of the Convention and the Agreement. The

of the Convention and Article I, Section 2, of the Agreement are clauses
of special jurisdiction. The attitude of States at the Vienna Conference
cannot be relied on to limit the jurisdictional clauses in the Convention
and the Agreement. At Vienna, apart from the particular circumstances of
the time, which are well known, the hesitation of States is to be explained
by their fear of writing a blank cheque for treaties of all kinds. In the
Convention, on the other hand, the objective of the jurisdictional clause is
concrete and clearly defined.

The observation that States would not welcome a judgment upholding
the Council's jurisdiction seems to be entirely contradicted by the actual
attitude of the States, or representatives of the States, at the time of the
vote taken in the Council. The interpretation given by the Council to the
jurisdictional clause is not contrary to sound principles, but is a step in the
right direction, which is to strengthen international organizations.

To ascertain the true meaning of a clause, one must not play with
words. When jurisdiction is conferred on a body to intepret a treaty,
jurisdiction is given above all to say whether or not the treaty is in force,
that is to say whether or not it has been terminated or suspended. The
question which has arisen is not whether a State has the right to suspend or
terminate a treaty under general rules of international law, but whether it
may do so under the rules of the treaty. The question is this: does breach
by one party of its contractual obligations entitle the other to declare its
own obligations at an end? It must not be overlooked that it is categorizing
the conduct of the parties as lawful or otherwise which enables one to say
whether there has been a breach of the Convention by one party or by
both, and if there has been a breach, what are the proper sanctions.
To do this one has to interpret the Convention and the Agreement.

For example, one would certainly need to interpret Article 89 of
the Convention in order to ascertain whether a certain State had acted
lawfully, in accordance with the Convention, if in 3 situation of hostility,
of acute confrontation, of cold war, it took the view that it had freedom of
action to do away with the privileges granted by the Convention, and
perhaps even to declare the effects of the Convention suspended vis-a-vis
another State.

But it does not appear to be correct to interpret the jurisdictional
clause as conferring the possibility of saying: I may, as and when I


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 129

It is not correct that the principle laid down in Article 60 of the Vienna
Convention is dehors the Chicago Convention. On the contrary, it is a
principle which follows from the contractual nature of treaties. There is
no frontier between treaties and international law; there is no frontier
which leaves the content of treaties outside international law. On the
contrary, it is thanks to international law that treaties have a legal signi-
ficance. The rules of international law are not outside treaties, they give
legal force to treaty rules. The principle pacta sunt servanda (Vienna
Convention, Art. 26) is not dehors treaties; it is this principle which makes
it possible to call for performance in good fatth of contractual obligations.
Article 60 is a complement and the sanction of the principle pacta sunt
servanda. It is the breach of rights or obligations having their source in
the agreement which lies at the root of the exceptio non adimpleti.

3. A fundamental point in the argument put forward in the Memorial
of India, to the effect that the Convention and Agreement are terminated
or suspended vis-a-vis Pakistan, 1s based on the application of Article 60
of the Vienna Convention and on certain observations of the Court in its
Advisory Opinion on Namibia (I.C.J. Reports 1971, pp. 47 and 49).
Perhaps one of the sources of the error in the construction of the Indian
argument may be found here: it does not take into account the differing
nature of treaties.

The draftsman of the Vienna Convention did not conceive of Article
60, paragraph 1, as imperative and general; quite the contrary. There
must be taken into account, above all, the rules peculiar to each treaty,
not only because of the principle pacta sunt servanda (Arts. 26, 56 and 58),
but also because of the reservations made in Article 42, paragraph 2,
and Article 60, paragraph 4. The differences between bilateral and multila-
teral treaties, and those which give rise to an international organization,
must also be taken into account.

The Vienna Convention “applies to any treaty which is the constituent
instrument of an international organization and to any treaty adopted
within an international organization without prejudice to any relevant
rules of the organization” (Art. 5).

In the course of the discussions at the Vienna Conference, emphasis
was laid on the need for the utmost respect for the peculiarities of inter-
national organizations. The States did not wish to weaken the growing
achievements and the effectiveness of international organizations®. In
any treaty creating an organization a distinction is to be drawn between:
(1) the constituent instrument of the organization, which is subject to the
lex generalis on the coming to birth of treaties, and (2) the constitution
which sets up the lex specialis or rules to govern the life and functioning

! See in this sense, Article 20, paragraph 3, of the Vienna Convention. See also
the report of the International Law Commission 1966, on Article 17 (Yearbook of
the I.L.C., 1966, Vol. ii, pp. 202-208, particularly para. 20).


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 130

of the organization. It is this special aspect which is responsible for the
classification of this type of treaty by writers among ‘‘treaty-laws” or
“Vereinbarungen”.

From the moment of its creation, an international organization is a
new juridical reality. It is an entity having its own rights and obligations,
its own purposes and functions, and thus a certain legal personality
(I.C.J. Reports 1949, pp. 179-181). It has the tie of legal personality,
which excludes the autonomy of its several members (/.C.J. Reports 1970,
p. 34, para. 40).

Whatever the nature of its legal personality may be, each organization
has a constitution which provides it with a general rule to which all its
members are subject. Their rights and obligations towards each other flow
from this constitution. Et is the fact that the organization is a legal person
which prevents the legal relationships between its members being con-
sidered as governed by a series of independent bilateral treaties. The life
of the organization is not governed disjunctively by an accumulation of
bilateral treaties. Members of the organization are linked together by the
constitution, and their relationships are governed by the. constitution.
Such relationships are those resulting from the status of member of the
organization, and not the status of a party to bilateral treaties. This is of
the very essence of organizations; it is required by the common interest,
and is a necessity for their functioning and effectiveness.

The State which is in breach of those of its obligations or duties which
derive from this constitution, towards another member State of the orga-
nization, is not in breach of a single bilateral treaty between them, it is
in breach of the constitution of the organization. The effects of such a
breach are governed by that constitution. It is only in a supplementary
way that the general rules of international law, those enshrined in the
Vienna Convention, may be applied *.

! India has referred to the Advisory Opinion given by the Court in the Namibia
case (I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 47), and drawn the conclusion that Article 60 of the
Vienna Convention applies generally to all treaties, and thus to the Convention and
the Transit Agreement. But the observations to be found in the Opinion must not
be taken out of context. In the Advisory Opinion it was said that “‘[the] General
Assembly . . . determines that . . . material breach had occurred in this case” (p. 47,
para. 95) and the 1962 Judgment was cited to the effect that *‘this Mandate, like
practically all other similar Mandates” was ‘‘a special type of instrument compo-
site in nature and instituting a novel international régime. It incorporates a definite
agreement . . .” (I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 46, para. 94). The Court, here as elsewhere,
had in contemplation the very particular nature of the Mandate. In a mandate or
a trust, the power of revocation is regarded as implicit. The Mandator, the League
of Nations, grants the mandate for the benefit of the people under trusteeship. The
United Nations, the successor to the League of Nations, has the right and the obli-
gation to withdraw the mandate, trust or guardianship, in any case where the man-
datory, the trustee or the guardian commits a breach of his obligations towards the
people of whom he was appointed trustee.

The Advisory Opinion in the Namibia case does not support India’s contention.
This is yet another example of the fact that the nature of each treaty must be taken
into account for the purposes of application of Article 60.


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 131

Therefore in order to ascertain the consequences of the breaches of
which India accuses Pakistan, one must above all take into account
the constitutional significance of the Convention and the Transit Agree-
ment.

ICAO is one of the most perfected international organizations. [ts
legal personality is clear, as is also its legal independence with regard to
its members. In the Convention, it was sought to bring out the full
juridical personality of the Organization for the exercise of its functions
in the territory of each State. subject to the sole reservation of the laws
of the State concerned (Art. 47).

The Organization has its own aims and objects, which are independent
of the particular interests of each member State, namely those of the
international community (Preamble and Art. 93bis); and each contrac-
ting State agrees not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent
with the aims of the Convention (Art. 4).

The Convention lists the rights and obligations of the members of the
Organization; it set up organs (the Assembly and the Council) to ensure
their implementation, and even provides for sanctions against States
which do not comply with their decisions (Arts. 84 to 88 of the Conven-
tion; Art. IT of the Agreement). It was in order to facilitate the achieve-
ment of the objects and principles of the Organization, it was to facilitate
its functioning, that a system was set up for settlement of disputes between
States as to the exercise or the breach of their rights and obligations (Art.
84 of the Convention; Art. I of the Agreement).

Two further groups of provisions may be mentioned which throw
light on the system of the Organization.

In the first place there are those provisions which fay down the prin-
ciple of non-discrimination between member States. In the solemn enume-
ration of the objectives of the Organization, one objective is to “avoid
discrimination between contracting States” (Art. 44 (g)). In the very
preamble to the Convention, there is mention of “equality of opportunity”,
and in several other articles stress in laid on the prohibition of any dis-
tinction between the aircraft of contracting States (Arts. 9, 11, 35). Still
with a view to avoiding special relationships between States which are
preferential or discriminatory, it was laid down that “the Contracting
States accept this Convention as abrogating all obligations and understan-
dings between them which are inconsistent with its terms, and undertake
not to enter into any such obligations and understandings” (Art. 82 of the
Convention).

Secondly, there are the provisions governing the way in which States’
obligations come to an end. Article 95 lays down the rules for denunci-
ation of the Convention. that is to say, for leaving the Organization. It
does not recognize the possibility of denunciation vis-à-vis a single member
State. This would seem to be inadmissible as contrary to the principles of
non-discrimination and legal personality. Are these principles the raison
d'être of Article 89? In case of war, the provisions of the Convention do
not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States con-


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 132

cerned, whether as belligerents or as neutrals; the same principle is applied
when a contracting State declares a state of national emergency. It should
be observed that even a state of war does not involve the termination of
the Convention between the contracting States; the point is that there are
no bilateral treaties between them. It is the Convention itself, which is
still in force, which confers upon the States concerned freedom of action
with regard to the obligations undertaken by them.
It would seem that the following conclusions may be drawn:

(1) Treaties creating organizations are subject to special rules, and not
to the rule laid down in Article 60 of the Vienna Convention.

(2) The rules of the Chicago Convention do not recognize the possibility
of a State declaring the Convention at an end vis-a-vis one other State.

(3) The special rules of the Convention and the Transit Agreement
exclude any possibility of applying the rule laid down in Article 60
of the Vienna Convention.

(4) The interpretation of Article 84 of the Convention, and Article TI
of the Transit Agreement, advanced by India, is contrary not only to
the letter and to the purpose of those Articles, but also to the system
of ICAO as an international organization.

4. India contends further—and this is the last point in its argument—
that it had power to put an end to its obligations toward Pakistan by
unilateral declaration. This argument has been advanced in a somewhat
unusual way. The chief counsel for India explains it thus:

Article 52 of the Convention states that “decisions by the Council shall
require approval by a majority of its members”. But Article 66 (b)
provides that “Members of the .. . Council who have not accepted...
the Transit Agreement . . . shall not have the right to vote on any ques-
tions referred to the .. . Council under the provisions of the . . . Agree-
ment’. In view of the object and spirit of these Articles, they must be
interpreted in the sense that decisions on questions raised under the
Agreement must be taken by a majority of the members entitled to vote.
The abstentions of the members of the Council which are not signatories
to the Agreement, or have not accepted it, should not be counted in
calculating the majority, because one can only talk of abstentions with
reference to those who are able to vote.

A rule of law may not be interpreted in a way which leads to an absurd
result (reductio ad absurdum). Can the abstentions (which are required
by Art. 66) of the members of the Council which have not signed or
accepted the Agreement, prevent decisions on questions relating to the
Agreement being taken, even if the members which have signed and
accepted the Agreement have voted unanimously for such decisions?

4. India argues further that the Council’s decision is vitiated because
the proposals put to the vote by the President were neither introduced
nor seconded by any member of the Council, as required by Rules 4! and
46 of the Rules of Procedure.

This objection seems to be the result of a misunderstanding. The
President did not in this case put forward any proposal; he put to the
vote the questions raised by India in its preliminary objections.

5. At the very last moment, towards the end of the public hearing of
23 June 1972, India made a fresh objection to the validity of the Council’s
decision !, and referred to the text of the decision, as reported in the
Pakistan Counter-Memorial (Annex IT). Article 15 of the Rules for the
Settlement of Differences states that the decision of the Council shall

! Is India’s objection contrary, on that account, to the procedural rules? This
is not a question of jurisdiction on which the Court would have to take a decision
proprio motu.

Is it possible on appeal to argue that the Council's decision was invalidated on
a ground which was not advanced before the lower tribunal?

Is not India’s silence throughout the whole of the proceedings until the hearing
of 23 June a case of acquiescence?


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 137

be in writing and shall contain “(v) the conclusions of the Council
together with its reasons for reaching them’. But the decision does not
give any reasons, and it is argued that this invalidates the decision.

The criticism thus made by India is ambiguously expressed. If one
compares the text of the decision with Article 15, referred to above, it
1s apparent that the text does not comply with any of the formal require-
ments of the Article. What we have before us is not a decision within the
meaning of Article 15, it is the official notification of a resolution adopted
by the Council.

The problem of the validity of the Council’s decision is thus not the
problem raised by India. India claims that the decision is invalid for breach
of a formal requirement, but what we are concerned with is not a decision
within the meaning of Article 15.

The problem is thus whether a decision within the meaning of Article
IS is necessary for a valid settlement of the preliminary issue raised by
India. India has not brought any evidence of the Council's practice in
similar cases, and has not addressed any thorough legal argument to the
Court on the point. India simply states that according to Article S, if
a preliminary objection is raised, the Council shall decide, and that ac-
cording to Article 15, decisions must contain the conclusions with reasons,
whereas the Council has given no reasons.

It is somewhat startling that the Secretary General and Legal Officers
of ICAO, the members of the Council, and even the Representative of
India, did not point out that the Council had not really taken any deci-
sion, that in fact nothing valid had been done, since there had been a
failure to take account of Article 15.

Without being an expert in the procedure of ICAO, it seems to me
that we may find in the Rules for the Settlement of Differences a satis-
factory explanation for the Council's conduct.

It would seem that in those Rules a distinction is made between two
procedures. One is governed by Article 5; it is a procedure which might
be regarded as interlocutory, short and simple, by which, after the parties
have been heard, a decision is taken, yes or no, to proceed or not to
proceed with the application. The preliminary issue raised by the preli-
minary objection is not governed by Chapter IV, which applies to or-
dinary proceedings. Chapter IV contemplates a more formal and com-
plicated procedure. It is this procedure which is terminated by the deci-
sion provided for in Article 15; this is a true judgment, a final decision
which presupposes the close of the proceedings; the decision is given
“after the close of the proceedings” (Art. 15, para. 4), and it must respect
formal requirements which are not necessary when it is the preliminary
issue which has to be decided. The decision under Article 15 puts an end
to the case for the Council. The decision dismissing the preliminary
objection, on the other hand, means that the procedure can continue,
and this explains why the Council at this stage continues to invite the
parties to the dispute to engage in negotiations.

There is no doubt as to the nature of the Note of 30 July 1971 on the


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 138

preliminary objections of India (Annex II to the Counter-Memorial
of Pakistan). It is a communication by which Pakistan (and there was no
doubt an identical communication to India) was informed that on 29 July
1971 the Council had decided not to uphold the preliminary objections,
and that accordingly the time-limit set for delivery of the Counter-
Memorial began to run as from 29 July. The Secretary General drew the
attention of the parties to the Council’s resolution of 8 April 1971 in which
they were invited to negotiate.

it is apparent that we are here in the frame of reference of Article 5,
and not at all in that of Article 15.

Furthermore it cannot be said, as India has done (C.R. 72/5, p. 45),
that the Rules of Procedure are statutory rules, having the same force
as the constituent instrument of the Council. The Rules for the Settle-
ment of Differences were not adopted by vote of the Parties to the Con-
vention, or of the members of the Assembly; it was the Council which
approved them on 9 April 1967. It is not the constituent instrument of
the Council, but something which the Council itself has produced. The
Council reserves to itself powers over the procedure (Art. 28), and
Article 33 tells us that “the present Rules may, at any time, be amended
by the Council”.


India has contended that the question of overflights of its territory by
aircraft of Pakistan is not governed by the Convention and Transit
Agreement, but by the Special Agreement of 1966 (which has been sus-
pended) between India and Pakistan. The consequence is thus that the
ICAO Council has no jurisdiction to take a decision on a question which
is outside the Convention and Transit Agreement.

India’s argument does not seem to take into account Article 82 of the
Convention, and Articles 30, paragraph 4, and 41, paragraph I, of the
Vienna Convention. In the case of a multilateral treaty, and a fortioriin
the case of the constituent instrument of an international organization,
two of the parties to the treaty can only conclude an agreement to modify
the treaty as between themselves if the possibility of such a modification
is provided for by the treaty, or the modification is not prohibited and is
not incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.
The Convention, in Article 82, imposes an obligation on all contracting

! In the sense of what has been called an ‘‘interprétation institutionnelle”.


ICAO COUNCIL (SEP. OP. DE CASTRO) 139

States not to contract obligations or understandings which are inconsis-
tent with the terms of the Convention.

The 1966 Agreement may be interpreted in two ways. One can either
hold that it contains provisions incompatible with the Convention, or
that its provisions are compatible with the Convention.

On the first hypothesis (incompatibility), it was not possible for the
Council to consider these provisions, because, being contrary to the
obligations undertaken by India and Pakistan, they are null and void
(contra legem).

On the other hypothesis (compatibility), the 1966 Agreement respected
all the imperative provisions of the Convention. It could not, therefore,
exclude the rules in the Convention concerning the jurisdiction of the
Council to take decisions on the interpretation or the application of the
Convention and Agreement, so that the Council has jurisdiction to state
whether India has or has not committed a breach of its obligations
towards Pakistan under the Convention, or the Transit Agreement, and
to state also, if appropriate, whether the provisions of the 1966 Agreement
are, or are not, compatible with those of the Convention !.
