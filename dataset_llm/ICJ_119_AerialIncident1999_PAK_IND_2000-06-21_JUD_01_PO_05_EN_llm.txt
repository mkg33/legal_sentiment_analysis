Obliged to dissent from the reasoning in the Judgment of the Court and its
conclusion, but in agreement with paragraphs 51 to 55 thereof — Effect of the
Indian Independence Act and Independence ( International Arrangements) Order
1947, dividing British India into two independent States, India and Pakistan,
both were successor States — General Act of 1928 devolved upon India and
Pakistan — Between 1947 and 1999 India and Pakistan settled their disputes
(i) by negotiations, (ii) through mediation of third parties, (iii) through judi-
cial tribunals and (iv) had agreed to have access to the International Court of
Justice if no other forum was available and filed appeal or application before the
International Court of Justice — India’s conduct covered by doctrine of estoppel
— India's Commonwealth reservation is aimed at Pakistan only and is obsolete,
discriminatory and is invalid under Article 39 of the General Act — Common-
wealth reservation is severable from the Indian declaration — India’s commu-
nication of 18 September 1974 was sent to counter the declaration of Pakistan
of 30 May 1974 that it was bound by the General Act and having regard to the
pleas raised by Pakistan before the ICJ in the Trial of Pakistani Prisoners of
War case, the Indian communication was not sent in good faith and cannot be
treated or deemed to be a denunciation of the General Act, among others, it did
not comply with Article 45 of the General Act — Analysis of the decisions of the
International Court of Justice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Supreme
Court of India — The Court has jurisdiction, among others, under Article 17 of
the General Act and, in view of the allegations of Pakistan that India, by shoot-
ing down Pakistan’s aircraft inside Pakistan's airspace and killing 16 trainees,
committed breaches of obligations of customary international law not to use
force and not to violate the sovereignty of another State — The Court's task is
to ensure respect for international law as its principal guardian — Judicial cau-
tion and restraint, but principles of constructive creativity and progressive real-
ism could be evolved — The Court ought to have rejected India’s preliminary
objection to the jurisdiction and ought to have entertained the Application filed
by Pakistan — The Parties are under obligation to settle in good faith their
disputes including the dispute regarding the State of Jammu and Kashmir and in
particular the dispute arising out of the aerial incident of 10 August 1999 — Let
India and Pakistan keep in view the ideals of Quaid-e-Azam Mohamed Ali Jin-
nah and Mahatma Gandhi and take effective measures to secure peace, security
and justice in South Asia.

Indian Independence Act

4. Section 1 (1) of the Indian Independence Act 1947 reads: “As from
the 15th day of August 1947, two Independent Dominions shall be set up
in India’ to be known respectively as India and Pakistan.” (Emphasis
added.)

The then British Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, stated before the House
of Commons:

“With regard to the status of these two Dominions, the names
were not meant to make any difference between them. They were
two successor States and both of them would be Dominions in the
fullest sense of the term.” (A. N. Aiyar, Constitutional Laws of India
and Pakistan, 1947 ed., p. 53.)

On 14 July 1947, dealing with the defence of the North West Frontier,
the British Prime Minister said:

“This is a matter that is very much in the minds of the Members
of both Successor Governments, and there is a Joint Defence Coun-
cil to consider it. I should not like to go further than to say that the
Government would be perfectly willing to go into discussions with
the Successor Government on any matter of common defence.”
(Official Report No. 440 C 127; emphasis added.)

The words with the Successor Government refer to Pakistan as the
North West Frontier is within its territory.


Estoppel

13. In June 1947, when British India was to be partitioned and two
independent Dominions — India and Pakistan — were to be established,
the British Government considered questions about judicial forums to
deal with the various problems arising out of partition and also with the
demarcation of the boundaries of the two States. The British Foreign
Office examined the issues whether the matters could be referred to the
International Court of Justice. Reference to the Court was ruled out for
the following reasons:

{a) Boundaries in such a case are not a question of international law to
which the Court is confined.

(hb) The Court can only decide disputes “between Parties already recog-
nized internationally as States” (The Transfer of Power, H.M. Sta-
tionery Office, Vol. XI, No. 71, p. 135.)

Eventually it was decided to establish an Arbitral Tribunal to deal with
the problems arising out of partition. Mr. Jinnah (Pakistan) suggested
that the Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal should be a member of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Pandit Nehru (India) suggested
that three Judges of the Federal Court of British India should constitute
the Arbitral Tribunal (ibid, p. 328). In the end there was agreement
that the Arbitral Tribunal should be composed of Sir Patrick Spens as
Chairman and two High Court Judges, one Muslim and one Hindu, as
members (ibid., p. 853).



So far as demarcation of boundaries was concerned, a Tribunal con-
sisted of five members, two from India, two from Pakistan, and Sir Cyril
Radcliffe as Chairman. India and Pakistan, both, were dissatisfied with
the awards, but accepted them.

14. On 23 June 1948 an Agreement relating to air services was
signed between India and Pakistan. Article XI, paragraphs (A) and (B),
provide:

“(A) If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating
to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement,
the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to
settle it by negotiation between themselves.

(B) If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotia-
tion,

(i) they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to an arbi-
tral tribunal appointed by agreement between them or to
some other person or body; or

(ii) if they do not so agree or if, having agreed to refer the dis-
pute to an arbitral tribunal, they cannot reach agreement
as to its composition, either Contracting Party may submit
the dispute for decision to any tribunal competent to
decide it which may hereafter be established within the
International Civil Aviation Organization or, if there is no
such tribunal, to the council of the said Organization, or
failing that, to the International Court of Justice.” (United
Nations, Treaty Series, Vol. 28, 1949, 1, No. 423, p. 158.)

At that time, both were Dominions and members of the Common-
wealth, but it was agreed that the dispute could be referred to the Inter-
national Court of Justice if no forum is available.

15. In 1950, Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, the former Prime Minister of
Pakistan urged India to refer the Canal Water Dispute to the Interna-
tional Court of Justice. He said:

“Under the Optional Clause the Government of India have agreed
to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court on the applica-
tion of countries which are not members of the Commonwealth. The
exception doubtless contemplated that there would be Common-
wealth machinery equally suited to the judicial settlement of disputes.
While such Commonwealth machinery is lucking it would be anoma-
lous to deny to a sister member of the British Commonwealth the
friendly means of judicial settlement that is offered by India to coun-
tries outside the Commonwealth.” (Letter dated 23 August 1950
from Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan to Shri Nehru.) (R. P. Anand, Compul-



sory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, p. 239; empha-
sis added.)

“though India admitted her Canal Water dispute with Pakistan to be
a justiciable dispute, she preferred to refer the dispute in the first
place to a tribunal consisting of two judges from India and two
judges from Pakistan. If such tribunal came to be deadlocked, she
proposed to settle those parts of the dispute which would not be
finally decided through negotiations, and failing that, to submit
them to arbitration or even to the International Court of Justice.”
(Letter dated 27 October 1950, from Mr. Nehru, Prime Minister of
India, to the Pakistan Prime Minister.) (/hid., p. 255.)

Act of 1928 since its Independence.

54. The said Communication was sent by India to counter the Com-
munication of Pakistan of 30 May 1974 whereby Pakistan expressed its
intention to be bound by the General Act. Such plea had already been
raised by Pakistan before the Court in the case Trial! of Pakistani Pris-
oners of War of 1973.

Pakistan has rightly urged about the Indian Communication:

“The first is that it is declaratory — and declaratory only. It is a
statement made in 1974 that as from an event in 1947 — that is to
say, 27 years previously, India’s independence — India was not a
party to the General Act ‘it is not and never has been’.

The second point follows closely from the first. It is that India’s
concern to make the position absolutely clear ‘. . . so that there is no
doubt in any quarter’, was merely a statement of its own view of the
legal position. It was a subjective statement which might or might
not have had objective validity (though, in so far as relevant, Paki-
stan says that it had no objective validity). Moreover, it was not a
denunciation of the General Act — and this was so for two reasons.
First, in India’s view there was no General Act to denounce. Second,
even if there was, India did not formally denounce it in the manner
provided for in Article 45 of the General Act . . . Consistent with the
logic of its position, India did not use words of denunciation because
that would have implied that India regarded itself as committed to
the General Act at the time of the denunciation, which it denied.
India could have done, if it had wished to denounce the General Act,
it could have done as both France and Britain did and denounced
the General Act formally, but it chose not to do so.” (CR 2000/1,
p. 54 (Lauterpacht).)

55. The assertions made by India in the said Communication are erro-
neous, misconceived and illegal. The said Communication cannot be
deemed to be a denunciation. There is no material before the Court that
any State party to the General Act treated India’s Communication as
denunciation. The Communication does not comply with the provisions
of Article 45 of the General Act. In the joint dissenting opinion in the
case of Nuclear Tests, dated 20 December 1974, reference was made to
India’s letter of 24 June 1973 (mentioned in paragraph 22 above) and
Pakistan’s declaration, but no notice was taken of India’s Communica-
tion of 18 September 1974:

“In the case concerning Trial of Pakistani Prisoners of War, by a
letter of 24 June 1973 India informed the Court of its view that the
1928 Act had ceased to be a treaty in force upon the disappearance




of the organs of the League of Nations. Pakistan, however, expressed
a contrary view and has since addressed to the Secretary-General a
letter from the Prime Minister of Pakistan affirming that she consid-
ers the Act as continuing in force. Again, although the United King-
dom, in a letter of 6 February 1974, referred to doubts having been
raised as to the continued legal force of the Act and notified the Sec-
retary-General of its denunciation of the Act in conformity with the
provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 45, it did so in terms which do
not prejudge the question of the continuance in force of the Act.

Moreover, it is axiomatic that the termination of a multilateral
treaty requires the express or tacit consent of all the parties, a
requirement which is manifestly not fulfilled in the present instance.”
(Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
1974, p. 344, para. 70.)

Reference may also be made to the practice of the Secretary-General of

the United Nations with regard to multilateral treaties:

“The International Law Commission in 1966 described this prac-
tice as follows:

‘In the absence of any clause on reservations in agreements con-
cluded after the General Assembly resolution on reservations to
multilateral conventions, the Secretary-General adheres to the
provisions of that resolution and communicates to the States con-
cerned the text of the reservation accompanying an instrument of
ratification or accession without passing on the legal effect of such
documents, and “leaving it to each State to draw legal conse-
quences from such communications”. He transmits the observa-
tions received on reservations to the States concerned, also with-
out comment. A general table is kept up to date for each
convention, showing the reservations made and the observations
transmitted thereon by the States concerned. A State which has
deposited an instrument accompanied by reservations is counted
among the parties required for the entry into force of the agree-
ment.” (Official Records, Twenty-first Session, Supplement No. 9
(A/6309/Rev.D), p. 37.)” (I.C.J. Pleadings, Trial of Pakistani
Prisoners of War, pp. 87, 88.)

56. The Government of India must have known the notifications of

France and the United Kingdom. The language of the notifications was
clear and categorical and specific mention therein was made about denun-
ciation. The omission thereof from the Indian Communication was not
cogently and plausibly explained by India.

Professor Rosenne states that “where the right of denunciation is

reserved, the State concerned must take a positive step to exercise it”
(Shabtai Rosenne, The Law and Practice of the International Court of
Justice, Vol. II, p. 82).




57. Further, the applicable rule is, as approved by the Court in the

North Sea Continental Shelf case, when an agreement or other instru-
ment itself provides for the way in which a given thing is to be done, it
must be done in that way or not al all (I. C.J. Reports 1969, para. 28).

58. Mere affirmation by India that it was not bound by the General

Act, which is denied by Pakistan, is unilateral and its validity cannot be
determined by the Court at the preliminary stage. Reference may be
made to the finding of the Court in the Appeal by India against Pakistan,
re: ICAO, which is res judicata.

“The Court considers however, that for precisely the same order
of reason as has already been noticed in the case of its own jurisdic-
tion in the present case, a mere unilateral affirmation of these con-
tentions — contested by the other party — cannot be utilized so as
to negative the Council’s jurisdiction. The point is not that these
contentions are necessarily wrong but that their validity has not yet
been determined. Since therefore the Parties are in disagreement as
to whether the Treaties ever were (validly) suspended or replaced by
something else; as to whether they are in force between the Parties
or not; and as to whether India’s action in relation to Pakistan over-
flights was such as not to involve the Treaties, but to be justifiable
aliter et aliunde; — these very questions are in issue before the
Council, and no conclusions as to jurisdiction can be drawn from
them, at least at this stage, so as to exclude ipso facto and a priori
the competence of the Council.” (Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction
of the ICAO Council, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1972, p. 64, para. 31.)

59. I am therefore of the opinion that the General Act of 1928 has not

been validly denounced by India and it continues to be bound by the said

Act.

EFFECT OF THE GENERAL ACT OF 1928 oN INDIA’S RESERVATION

60. The 1928 Act contains a strict code of rules regulating the making

of reservations. This aspect has been dealt with in paragraph 82 of the
joint dissenting opinion in the Nuclear Tests case:


“In the present instance, this objection is reinforced by the fact
that the 1928 Act contains a strict code of rules regulating the
making of reservations, whereas no such rules govern the making of
reservations to acceptances of the Court’s jurisdiction under the
optional clause. These rules, which are to be found in Articles 39, 40,
41, 43 and 45 of the Act, impose restrictions, inter alia, on the kinds



of reservations that are admissible and the times at which they may
be made and at which they will take effect. In addition, a State
accepting jurisdiction under the optional clause may fix for itself the
period for which its declaration is to run and may even make it ter-
minable at any time by giving notice, whereas Article 45 (1) of the
Act prescribes that the Act is to remain in force for successive fixed
periods of five years unless denounced at least six months before the
expiry of the current period. That the framers of the 1928 Act delib-
erately differentiated its régime in regard to reservations from that of
the optional clause is clear; for the Assembly of the League, when
adopting the Act, simultaneously in another resolution drew the
attention of States to the wide possibilities of limiting the extent of
commitments under the optional clause ‘both as regards duration
and as regards scope’. Consequently, to admit that reservations
made by a State under the uncontrolled and extremely flexible sys-
tem of the optional clause may automatically modify the conditions
under which it accepted jurisdiction under the 1928 Act would run
directly counter to the strict system of reservations deliberately pro-
vided for in the Act.” (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judg-
ment, LC.J. Reports 1974, p. 349, para. 82.)

1. The reservations made by India to Article 17 of the General Act

are prohibited by that Act and are without legal effect because the opera-
tion of Article 17 of the General Act is subject to Article 39.


Article 39 provides:

“]. In addition to the power given in the preceding article, a
Party, in acceding to the present General Act, may make his accept-
ance conditional upon the reservations exhaustively enumerated in
the following paragraph. These reservations must be indicated at the
time of accession.

2. These reservations may be such as to exclude from the pro-
cedure described in the present Act:

(a) disputes arising out of facts prior to the accession either of the
Party making the reservation of or any other Party with whom
the said Party may have a dispute;

{b) disputes concerning questions which by international law are
solely within the domestic jurisdiction of States;

(ce) disputes concerning particular cases or clearly specified subject-
matters, such as territorial status, or disputes falling within
clearly defined categories.

3. If one of the parties to a dispute has made a reservation, the
other parties may enforce the same reservation in regard to that
Party.


4. In the case of Parties who have acceded to the provisions of the
present General Act relating to judicial settlement or to arbitration,
such reservations as they may have made shall, unless otherwise
expressly stated, be deemed not to apply to the procedure of con-
ciliation.”

The reservations made by India do not fall under the permissible
reservations exhaustively set out in Article 39 of the General Act.

62. 1 would also draw the attention to Article 41 of the General Act
which reads as follows:

“Disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the
present General Act, including those concerning the classification
of disputes and the scope of reservations, shall be submitted to the
Permanent Court of International Justice.”

This jurisdiction is saved to the present Court by virtue of Article 37 of
the Statute. Consequently, since questions of interpretation and applica-
tion of the General Act have arisen, including those concerning the scope
of reservations and their admissibility, the International Court of Justice
has jurisdiction to determine the matter.

63, The Court has jurisdiction under Article 17 of the General Act,
notwithstanding India’s reservation as was held by the Court in the
Appeal relating to the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council, Judgment, LCJ.
Reports 1972, p. 53 and, in view of the observations made in this behalf in
the joint dissenting opinion in the case concerning Nuclear Tests ( Australia
v. France), I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 253, paras. 91, 94, 95 and 97.

64. In any case, there is lack of good faith on the part of India. In the
case of Cameroon v. Nigeria, the Court has set out the principle of good
faith:

“The Court observes that the principle of good faith is a well-
established principle of international law. It is set forth in Article 2,
paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations; it is also embod-
ied in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of
23 May 1969.” (Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon
and Nigeria, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 296, para. 38.)

65. In view of these considerations, I am of the opinion that the Court
is competent to exercise jurisdiction under Articles 17, 39 and 41 of the
General Act, read with Article 36, paragraph 1, and Article 37 of the
Statute.

Without prejudice to the above, the following observations may be
made.




RESERVATIONS
General Observations

66. Some general remarks may be made as to the reservations. The

observations made by two distinguished former Presidents of the Court
may be reproduced.


Dr. Nagendra Singh (India):

“Over the years however, States have come to attach more and
more exceptions and reservations and exclusions to their declara-
tions of acceptance until today the declaration of India, for example,
contains eleven separate reservations one of which is subdivided into
five subsections . . .

Yet when such an acceptance is so whittled away, or hedged
around with reservations and exclusions, that the actual kernel of
jurisdiction remaining is minimal, the effect of such a gesture can
hardly be regarded as encouraging . . . the apparent simplicity of the
optional clause, a simplicity which appears to have been intended by
its creators, has disappeared under the shadow of a thicket of over-
lapping and interconnecting reservations, making the task of the
Court based on optional clause jurisdiction in some cases an
extremely difficult one.” (Judge Nagendra Singh, The Role and
Record of the International Court of Justice, pp. 19, 20.)

Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan (Pakistan):

“In other words, and this is the point which it is worth stressing,
as the composition of the United Nations has become wider, the idea
of compulsory judicial settlement, which was favoured by so many
of the States gathered at San Francisco in 1945, has also found
increased acceptance, but at a markedly slower rate. The system of
compulsory judicial settlement was of course not built in as an inte-
gral part of the United Nations peace-keeping machine; but it is to
be feared that widespread hesitation in the acceptance of that system
may betray certain reserve with regard to the general principle of
judicial settlement of disputes, which, as we have seen, was built into
the United Nations system.

Another discouraging tendency, the seeds of which were sown in
1946, is that of depositing declarations of acceptance of the Courts
compulsory jurisdiction subject to reservations. Reservations of this
kind have been before the Court on more than one occasion, and
have been the subject of severe criticism. Nevertheless, although in
recent years there has been some improvement in this respect, there
are still deposited with the Secretary-General, and not withdrawn,
declarations of this kind which, as recognitions of jurisdiction, are
no more than the shadow without the substance.” (/hid., p. 294.)



In view of the observations aforesaid, validity of India’s reservations is
open to question.

ARTICLE 36, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT

AND THE INDIAN RESERVATION

67. Pakistan has tried to establish that a reservation which is not per-
missible under Article 36, paragraph 3, of the Statute has no legal effect
when objection is taken to it by the applicant State. Such a reservation
has been described as ultra vires of Article 36 of the Statute or an extra-
statutory reservation.

68. During the oral submissions Pakistan pleaded:

“(a)

... the Commonwealth reservation which India claims to invoke,
lies outside the range of reservations which are permitted by
Article 36, paragraph 3, of the Statute. The language of this
paragraph is clear. Declarations shall be made either uncondi-
tionally or upon two possible conditions: reciprocity or for a
certain time. I shall refer to reservations which fall outside the
permitted scope as ‘extra-statutory’. 1 shall submit that an
extra-statutory reservation made by a defendant State may be
applied by the Court against a plaintiff State only if there is
something in the case which allows the Court to conclude, and
I emphasize to conclude, that the plaintiff has accepted the
reservation. Such acceptance can be inferred in two situations.
One is where the plaintiff State has itself made the same or a
comparable reservation. The other is when the plaintiff, being
confronted by the invocation of the reservation by the defend-
ant State, has shown itself willing to join issue on the interpre-
tation of the content of the reservation, without challenging its
opposability to itself. But if the plaintiff challenges the appli-
cability of the reservation, and I emphasize this, then the
Court must decide, by reference to its content and the circum-
stances, whether it is applicable or opposable as against the
plaintiff.” (CR 2000/1, pp. 17-18 (Munshi).)

“The obvious answer — an answer Pakistan is now challenging —
is that the State practice has modified the express terms of Article 36,
paragraph 3, and people generally have come to believe that any
kind of reservation is permissible with the possible exception, per-
haps, of reservations which seek to deprive the Court of the right to
determine questions relating to its own jurisdiction — the so-called
automatic reservations.

The first comment to be made on this is that the number of States




concerned is limited. One hundred and eighty-five States are parties
to the Statute of the Court. Sixty States are parties to the optional
clause. Of these, 23 have signed without any extra-statutory reserva-


69. Pakistan’s pleas may be examined in the context of the Judgments

of the Court. In the recent case concerning Fisheries Jurisdiction ( Spain
v. Canada), the Court gave effect to a Canadian reservation to the
optional clause relating to fisheries conservation and management
matters. That reservation apparently fell outside the ambit of reserva-
tions permitted by Article 36, paragraph 3. The Court described Spain’s
position regarding the relevant reservation as follows:

“Spain appears at times to contend that Canada’s reservation is
invalid or inoperative by reason of incompatibility with the Court’s
Statute, the Charter of the United Nations and with international
law. However, Spain’s position mainly appears to be that these
claimed incompatibilities require an interpretation to be given to para-
graph 2 (d) of the declaration different from that advanced by
Canada.” (Fisheries Jurisdiction ( Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of
the Court, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1998, p. 451, para. 40.)

Having referred to the Spanish arguments, which showed that Spain’s

main dispute with Canada related to the interpretation of the reservation,
the Court stated:


“Accordingly, the Court concludes that Spain contends that the
‘interpretation’ of paragraph 2 (d) of its declaration sought for by
Canada would not only be an anti-statutory interpretation, but also
an anti-Charter interpretation and an anti-general international law
interpretation, and thus should not be accepted. The issue for the
Court is consequently to determine whether the meaning to be
accorded to the Canadian reservation allows the Court to declare


that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute brought before
it by Spain’s Application.” (LC.J. Reports 1998, pp. 451-452,
para. 41.)

70. The Court therefore did not examine the validity or applicability
of the Canadian reservation by noting that both States recognized “a
wide liberty in formulating their declarations”.

In the case concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru
v. Australia) (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 1992,
p. 240), Australia, as defendant, invoked the terms of its reservation
excluding disputes “in regard to which the parties thereto have agreed or
shall agree to have recourse to some other method of peaceful settle-
ment”. That was a reservation evidently outside the terms of Article 36,
paragraph 3. The Court rejected the argument on the ground that no
relevant alternative existed. The Court noted that Nauru’s declaration
also contained a similar reservation and thus assumed willingness on the
part of the two countries to accept and give effect to the reservation.

71. In the Nicaragua case, the Court merely interpreted the second
type of condition permitted under Article 36, paragraph 3, i.e. “for a
certain time”. It stated:

“In particular, it [a declarant State] may limit its effect to disputes
arising after a certain date; or it may specify how long the declara-
tion itself shall remain in force, or what notice (if any) will be
required to terminate it.” (Military and Paramilitary Activities in
and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America),
Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1984, p. 418,
para. 59.)

The Court, in explaining the kind of reservations that may be made,
limited itself to examples which fall clearly within the range permitted by
Article 36, paragraph 3.

72. Reference can also be made, in this context, to the decisions of the
Court in the cases of Certain Norwegian Loans and the Interhandel. The
validity or applicability of the automatic reservation was not adjudicated
upon. In the words of Professor lan Brownlie:

“In principle this form of reservation is incompatible with the
Statute of the Court, since it contradicts the power of the Court to
determine its own jurisdiction and is not a genuine acceptance of
jurisdiction ante hoc. (Footnote: The Court has avoided the issue
when it has been raised, as in the Case of Certain Norwegian Loans,
ICJ Reports (1957), 9; and the Interhandel case, ibid. (1959), 6.
However, a number of judges have held the reservation to be illegal;
see ICJ Reports (1957), 42(f. (Lauterpacht), 68-70 (Guerrero);
ibid. (1959), 55-9 (Spender), 76-8 (Klaestad), 92-4 (Armand-Ugon),
97ff.)” (Professor lan Brownlie, Principles of Public International
Law, 5th ed., p. 723.)

73. The comments of Professor Rosenne may also be mentioned:




“The Norwegian Loans, Interhandel and Right of Passage (Pre-
liminary Objections) cases are three principal instances of judicial
discussion of the validity of a reservation. In each of those instances
it was argued that a particular reservation was incompatible with the
optional clause, so that the whole declaration was ineffective to
establish the compulsory jurisdiction. Although the parties argued
the cases on the basis of the compatibility of the reservation with the
system of the compulsory jurisdiction, the Court did not place itself
on the same basis.

This leads to the conclusion that if, in principle and in practice,
reservations other than those envisaged in Article 36, paragraph 3,
of the Statute are not in themselves inadmissible, the validity of any
specific reservation is a matter to be decided in each case.” (Shabtai
Rosenne, The Law and Practice of the International Court, 1920-
1996, Vol. 11, Jurisdiction, pp. 770, 771.)

74. Pakistan’s contentions as to inapplicability and/or lack of oppos-

ability to Pakistan of India’s Commonwealth reservation are not incon-
sistent with the decisions of the Court involving anti-statutory reserva-
tions. Moreover, views expressed by some of the Judges of the Court
in their opinions in the Fisheries Jurisdiction case (reproduced hereafter
in paragraphs 89-91) support the contention of Pakistan. Reference may
also be made to the following:


“The expectation was that a general system of compulsory juris-
diction would be generated as declarations multiplied. The concep-
tion was sound enough, but the conditions in which the system has
functioned have reduced its effectiveness. The negative factors are
generally the lack of confidence in international adjudication on the
part of governments, the practice accepted by the Court, of making
declarations, subject to various reservations and conditions, fre-
quently arbitrary in extent, and ambiguous in form, and the tactical
advantages of staying out of the system.” (Professor lan Brownlie,
Principles of Public International Law, p. 721.)

R. P. Anand, the well-known Indian writer, states:

“As we have said earlier, the Optional Clause does not stand by
itself. It is an integral part of the Statute and adherence to the
Optional Clause means adherence to the whole of the Statute. It
does not appear to be open to states in their unilateral declarations
to make their acceptance of jurisdiction conditional upon non-appli-
cation of constitutional provisions of the Court’s Statute. The Court
is required, both by Article 92 of the Charter and Article 1 of the
Statute, to function in accordance with the Statute. Indeed, the old
Court, even though it was not bound by such an express injunction
to observe the Statute, held in the Free Zones case that it had no
power to depart from the terms of the Statute on the proposal of the



parties to a case. The Optional Clause, therefore, although it leaves
to an individual state large discretion as to the terms on which it
accepts the compulsory jurisdiction, does not permit a state to make
a declaration which is incompatible with the fixed constitutional
provisions of the Court’s Statute.” (R. P. Anand, Compulsory Juris-
diction of the International Court of Justice, p. 189.)

Declarations

applicable to the circumstances of the case:

“It may be first noted that the multilateral treaty reservation could
not bar adjudication by the Court of all Nicaragua’s claims, because
Nicaragua, in its Application, does not confine those claims only to
violations of the four multilateral conventions referred to above
(paragraph 68). On the contrary, Nicaragua invokes a number of
principles of customary and general international law that, accord-
ing to the Application, have been violated by the United States. The
Court cannot dismiss the claims of Nicaragua under principles of
customary and general international law, simply because such prin-
ciples have been enshrined in the texts of the conventions relied upon
by Nicaragua.” (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against
Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction
and Admissibility, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1984, pp. 423, 424, 425,
paras. 71, 74.)

THE COURT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN REJECTED

97. For the reasons set out above, my view is that the Court ought to
have rejected the preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court



by the Government of India and ought to have entertained the Applica-
tion filed by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on 21 September 1999.
