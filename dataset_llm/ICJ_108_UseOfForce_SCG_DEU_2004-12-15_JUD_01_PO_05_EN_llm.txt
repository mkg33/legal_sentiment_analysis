1. The Court finds that it has no jurisdiction in this case because the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)! did not have access to the Court
at the time it filed its Application. The first ground upon which the
Court makes this finding is Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
Court.

2. Article 35, paragraph 1, provides that “[t]he Court shall be open to
the States parties to the present Statute”. Under Article 93, paragraph 1,
of the United Nations Charter, all “Members of the United Nations are
ipso facto [States] parties”. The Court holds that the FRY was not a
State party to the Statute because the FRY was not a Member of the
United Nations at the time it filed its Application in the instant case, and
therefore, in the view of the Court, the Court was not “open” to the
FRY. Because, in my view, the FRY was a Member of the United
Nations when it filed its Application, I disagree.

tively (United Nations doc. A/RES/49/19B) and 0.060, 0.034 and 0.026 per cent for the

Court under the conditions laid down by the Statute.” (Application

Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of

clusion. It held that:

“Resolution 47/1 did not deprive the FRY of all the attributes of
United Nations membership: the only practical consequence was its
inability to participate in the work of the General Assembly, its sub-
sidiary organs, conferences or meetings convened by it. Apart from
that, it continued to function as a member of the United Nations in
many areas of the work of the United Nations . . . Thus, while the
FRY’s membership was lost for certain purposes, it was retained for
others . . . The proper approach to the issue of the FRY membership
of the United Nations in the period between 1992 and 2000 is not
one that proceeds on a[n] a priori, doctrinaire assumption that its
exclusion from participation in the work of the General Assembly
necessarily meant that it was no longer a member of the United
Nations. As the FRY membership was neither terminated nor sus-
pended by General Assembly resolution 47/1, it is more appropriate
to make a determination of its United Nations membership in that
period on an empirical, functional and case-by-case basis.” 8

13. The Court has now characterized the FRY’s sui generis position as
one that “could not have amounted to its membership in the Organiza-
tion” (Judgment, para. 76) and held that the FRY’s admission to the
United Nations in 2000 “did not have and could not have had, the effect
of dating back to the time when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia broke up and disappeared” (ibid. ). This, in my view, lacks a solid

1. The FRY did not invoke Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s
Statute as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. The Court decided proprio
motu to address it!?, holding that the FRY, as a non-party to the Statute,
could not invoke a treaty which entered into force after the entry into
force of the Statute as a basis for access to the Court under Article 35,
paragraph 2. I have explained the reasons for my disagreement with the
Court’s conclusion that the FRY was not a Member of the United
Nations in 1999. However, assuming that it was a non-Member, I also
cannot agree that it would not have access to the Court under the pro-
visions of Article 35, paragraph 2.

finding that

“proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,
LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 19; emphasis added) !3.

Court” (ibid.). The Court now holds, however, that “treaty in force”
means a “treaty in force at the time that the Court’s Statute came into
force”, and therefore concludes that the Genocide Convention, having
come into force after the Court’s Statute, does not give the FRY access
to the Court under Article 35, paragraph 2.

11. By analogy, in the context of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War, the
Genocide Convention can be considered a treaty connected with the

1. The Court found that the FRY did not have access to the
Court and the Court did not therefore consider it necessary to decide
whether the FRY was or was not a party to the Genocide Convention
at the time it filed its Application. In my view, the FRY did have access
to the Court under the provisions of Article 35 and I shall proceed to

“Without prejudice as to whether or not the principle of ‘auto-
matic succession’ applies in the case of certain types of international
treaties or conventions, the Court does not consider it necessary, in
order to decide on its jurisdiction in this case, to make a determina-
tion on the legal issues concerning State succession in respect to trea-
ties which have been raised by the Parties.” (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II),

V. CONCLUSION

The FRY had every right to claim the continuity of the legal person-
ality of its predecessor with respect of the territory of Serbia and Mon-
tenegro. In the FRY’s case, however, the competent United Nations

in paragraph 115 of the Judgment, which states that the Court “//Jinds
that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the Application
filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999”. 1 was therefore able
to vote in favour of the Judgment.
