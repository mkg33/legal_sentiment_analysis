                         1. In the present case, the Court has used the three‑stage approach to
                      establish the maritime boundary between Somalia and Kenya in the
                      exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf within 200 nautical
                      miles. Although this methodology has been applied in a number of cases
                      since the Black Sea Judgment (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea
                      (Romania v. Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 61), as this case
                      demonstrates, the question whether its methodological approaches are
                      suitable for all types of maritime delimitation cases requires review.

                         2. The relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on
                      the Law of the Sea (hereinafter “UNCLOS” or the “Convention”) on the
                      maritime delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and the continental
                      shelf are contained in Articles 74 and 83. As the Court points out in the
                      Judgment, they are of “a very general nature and do not provide much by
                      way of guidance for those involved in the maritime delimitation exercise”
                      (Judgment, para. 121). In such an exercise, all that is required to do under
                      these provisions is to achieve an equitable solution, either through nego-
                      tiations or by a third‑party settlement. In other words, there is no manda-
                      tory methodology provided for under the Convention. This is certainly
                      not an omission, but a deliberate and well‑considered choice on the part
                      of the States parties.
                         3. Historically, there were two main schools of thought among States
                      on the principles for the maritime delimitation of continental shelf: one is
                      the principle of equidistance as expressed in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the
                      1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, the other the equita-
                      ble principles. Positions taken by States on these two schools varied
                      greatly, given the geographical circumstances of the maritime area in
                      which States find themselves; the equidistance method worked well in
                      some cases, producing an equitable solution, while in others it did not.
                      Therefore, it came as no surprise that the equidistance method was never
                      accepted as a rule in international law that applies to maritime delimita-
                      tions.

                         4. In the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the Court, for the first
                      time, was requested to pronounce on the applicable principles and rules
                      of international law for the delimitation of continental shelf. The Court
                      rejected the claims of Denmark and the Netherlands to apply the equidis-
                      tance method (North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/
                      Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J.
                      Reports 1969, pp. 45‑46, para. 82) and stated that delimitation was to be

                      effected in accordance with equitable principles (North Sea Continental
                      Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Ger‑
                      many/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 46‑47, para. 85).
                      Among the three parties concerned in the joint cases, their coastlines were
                      comparable in length and equally treated by nature, but they were not
                      straight lines. If the equidistance method were adopted to draw the
                      boundary lines, it would not produce an equitable result. The Court con-
                      sidered that, in doing so, one of the States should enjoy continental shelf
                      rights considerably different from those of its neighbours merely because
                      in the one case the coastline was roughly convex in form and in the other
                      it was markedly concave, although those coastlines were comparable in
                      length (ibid., p. 50, para. 91). To overcome the distorting effect caused by
                      such irregular situations, the Court considered that a balancing was called
                      for in the delimitation. It stated that

                            “the element of a reasonable degree of proportionality which a delim-
                            itation effected according to equitable principles ought to bring about
                            between the extent of the continental shelf appertaining to the States
                            concerned and the lengths of their respective coastlines, — these being
                            measured according to their general direction in order to establish the
                            necessary balance between States with straight, and those with mark-
                            edly concave or convex coasts, or to reduce very irregular coastlines
                            to their truer proportions” (ibid., p. 52, para. 98).
                         5. The equitable principles enunciated by the Court in the North Sea
                      Continental Shelf Judgment thus became the guiding principles for mari-
                      time delimitation. Subsequently, these principles were reflected in Arti-
                      cles 74 and 83 of UNCLOS, according to which the exercise of delimitation
                      must achieve an equitable solution. A maritime boundary that is estab-
                      lished by bilateral negotiations is deemed equitable, as the States con-
                      cerned agree to accept it as such. In the third‑party settlement, how to
                      achieve an equitable solution very much depends on the methodology
                      used. In the ensuing years, the Court through judicial practice has gradu-
                      ally formulated some methodological approaches in the maritime delimi-
                      tation, taking into account various geographical circumstances. In the
                      Romania v. Ukraine case, these approaches were synthesized into a gen-
                      eral delimitation methodology, which is conveniently called “the three-
                      stage approach” (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v.
                      Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, pp. 101‑103, paras. 115‑122). By
                      going through three stages, the Court will first construct a provisional
                      equidistance line on the base points that are selected on strictly geometri-
                      cal criteria on the basis of objective data. It will then “consider whether
                      there are factors calling for the adjustment or shifting of the provisional
                      equidistance line in order to achieve an equitable result” (ibid., p. 101,
                      para. 120, referring to Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon
                      and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea intervening), Judg‑
                      ment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 441, para. 288). Such factors, referred to as

                      314 	              maritime delimitation (decl. xue)

                      “relevant circumstances”, are left to the Court to determine, although
                      those accepted so far are mostly geographical circumstances. Finally, the
                      Court will subject the depicted line, adjusted or otherwise, to a dispropor-
                      tionality test to check whether there is any marked disproportion between
                      the ratio of the length of the relevant coasts of the parties and the ratio of
                      the respective shares of the relevant area apportioned by the depicted line
                      to the parties. This test is designed to ensure the equitableness of the out-
                      come of the delimitation.

                         6. The three-stage approach, notwithstanding its methodological cer-
                      tainty and objectivity, is a practice‑based method. At each stage, geo-
                      graphical circumstances of each case are determinative for the purpose of
                      delimitation. For example, what base points should be chosen, and what
                      factors constitute relevant circumstances, must be “case specific”, to be
                      determined by the Court in the context of each case (Arbitration between
                      Barbados and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Award of 11 April
                      2006, Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XXVII,
                      p. 215, para. 242). The three‑stage approach is intended to develop objec-
                      tive criteria and standard techniques for the maritime delimitation, but in
                      practice, such criteria and techniques should not be applied mechanically.
                         7. In the first stage, in order to construct the provisional equidistance
                      line, the first and essential step is to identify the parties’ coasts whose
                      seaward projections overlap (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea
                      (Romania v. Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, pp. 96‑97,
                      para. 99). By the Court’s jurisprudence, the coast that generates projec-
                      tions overlapping with projections from the coast of the other party is
                      considered as relevant (ibid.; Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab
                      Jamahiriya), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1982, p. 61, para. 75). In the pres-
                      ent case, the coastline of the Parties in the area is simply straight, without
                      any particular maritime features or indentations. Being adjacent to each
                      other, the coasts of the Parties are both seaward, abutting the same mari-
                      time area and the same continental shelf. In identifying the relevant
                      coasts, the Court, using radial projection, measures that the relevant
                      coast of Somalia extends for approximately 733 km and that of Kenya
                      extends for approximately 511 km. As sketch‑map No. 8 in the Judgment
                      (p. 256) illustrates, a substantial portion of the relevant coast of Somalia
                      does not generate entitlements that actually overlap with those from the
                      Kenyan coast. Although radial projection is normally used to identify the
                      relevant coasts, it is questionable to use it under the present circumstances.
                      It overstretches the length of the relevant coasts, particularly that on the
                      Somali side. In the Costa Rica v. Nicaragua case, some segments of the
                      relevant coast on the Costa Rican side in the Pacific Ocean, namely, from
                      Punta Herradura to Punta Salsipuedes, seem also left out of the identified
                      relevant area (Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific
                      Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Land Boundary in the Northern
                      Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      2018 (I), pp. 210‑214, paras. 181, 184, 185). An examination of

                      315 	               maritime delimitation (decl. xue)

                      the facts, however, tells a different story. Those segments, first of all, fall
                      within approximately 200 nautical miles from the starting-point of the
                      boundary between the parties. The total length of the relevant coast of
                      Costa Rica is measured as 416.4 km. That means there are genuine
                      ­overlapping ­entitlements generated from that coast. Second, the reason
                       why it does not abut the relevant area is due to the geographical circum-
                      stance of the Nicoya Peninsula. Given the geographical circumstances of
                      that case, the radial projection is the most appropriate methodology to be
                      used.

                         8. Under the circumstances of the present case, both Parties’ coasts are
                      properly seaward, without geographical irregularities. There is no reason
                      to leave out any segments of the coasts unless they do not produce any
                      overlapping entitlements, in which case they should not be identified as
                      the relevant coast in the first place. In the Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire case
                      (Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Atlantic Ocean (Ghana/
                      Côte d’Ivoire), Judgment, ITLOS Reports 2017, p. 4), the coastal situa-
                      tion between the parties for the maritime delimitation possesses many
                      similarities with that in the present case. The coastline of Ghana and Côte
                      d’Ivoire, two adjacent States, is almost as straight as that of Somalia and
                      Kenya, extending a substantial distance on each side from the land
                      boundary terminus. With regard to Côte d’Ivoire’s relevant coast, Côte
                      d’Ivoire claimed that its entire coast was relevant, but Ghana contended
                      that it should extend from the land boundary terminus until the vicinity
                      of Sassandra, a point which is about 350 km west of the land boundary
                      terminus. In explaining its position, Ghana stated:


                            “west of [Sassandra] point, the Ivorian coastline is almost entirely
                            beyond 200 M from the maritime entitlements claimed by Ghana . . .
                            there is no overlap with any Ghanaian entitlement with any projec-
                            tions emanating from the western segment of the Ivorian coast, and
                            therefore that western part of Côte d’Ivoire’s coast cannot be relevant
                            to the delimitation” (ibid., p. 104, para. 365).
                      According to Ghana, the relevant coast for Côte d’Ivoire is 308 km, and
                      that for Ghana is 121 km.
                        9. The Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of
                      the Sea (hereinafter the “ITLOS Chamber” or “Chamber”), using the
                      equidistance/relevant circumstances methodology, found that
                            “[t]he Côte d’Ivoire coast from [the land boundary terminus] until
                            Sassandra generate[d] . . . projections into the maritime area to be
                            delimited. The projections of this part of the coast of Côte d’Ivoire
                            overlap[ped] with projections of the Ghanaian coast and accord-
                            ingly this part of the Ivorian coast [was] relevant” (ibid., p. 106,
                            para. 377).


                      316 	              maritime delimitation (decl. xue)

                      With regard to Côte d’Ivoire’s coast west of Sassandra, the Chamber was
                      of the view that that part of the coast did not have a projection to the sea
                      in a way that overlapped with the disputed area, and therefore did not
                      constitute part of the relevant coast (see Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire case (Delim‑
                      itation of the Maritime Boundary in the Atlantic Ocean (Ghana/Côte
                      d’Ivoire), Judgment, ITLOS Reports 2017, p. 107, sketch‑map No. 2,
                      reproduced below, p. 317). It emphasized that “what the relevant coast
                      is — or, in other words, which seaward projection of the coast creates an
                      overlap — is determined by the geographic reality of that coast” (ibid.,
                      p. 106, para. 378; emphasis added). Accordingly, the Chamber decided
                      that the length of the relevant Ghanaian coast was approximately 139 km
                      and that of Côte d’Ivoire 352 km (ibid., para. 379). On the basis of this
                      identification, the Chamber determined the relevant area (see ibid., p. 109,
                      sketch‑map No. 3, reproduced below, p. 318). This finding of the Cham-
                      ber, in my view, properly reflects the technical nexus between the relevant
                      coasts and the relevant area for the purposes of the delimitation. It should
                      be the geographic reality and genuine overlapping entitlements that deter-
                      mine which part of a coast is relevant.
                         10. The problem with the radial projection in this case also exists in the
                      relevant area identified by the Court, which, in my view, does not encom-
                      pass the entire potential overlapping entitlements of the Parties in this
                      case. In their submissions to the Court, both Parties have requested the
                      Court to determine the complete course of the maritime boundary
                      between Somalia and Kenya in the Indian Ocean, including in the conti-
                      nental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. Based on its finding that both Par-
                      ties had made submissions on the limits of the continental shelf beyond
                      200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf
                      (hereinafter the “CLCS”) in accordance with Article 76, paragraph 8, of
                      UNCLOS, before the present proceedings and, as the matter stands, nei-
                      ther of them questions the existence of the other Party’s entitlement to a
                      continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles or the extent of that claim,
                      the Court decides to proceed to the delimitation of the continental shelf
                      beyond 200 nautical miles. With regard to the absence of the recommen-
                      dations of the CLCS on the establishment of the outer limits of the con-
                      tinental shelves, the Court emphasizes that “the lack of delineation of the
                      outer limit of the continental shelf is not, in and of itself, an impediment
                      to its delimitation between two States with adjacent coasts” (Judgment,
                      para. 189). However, this decision of the Court is not reflected in the rel-
                      evant area identified by the Court, which does not comprise the potential
                      overlapping entitlements of the Parties beyond 200 nautical miles.

                         11. Once the Court decides to go ahead with the delimitation of the
                      boundary in the outer continental shelf, even with care, it means that the
                      relevant area should include the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
                      miles. With the radial projection methodology, it is difficult to proceed to
                      identifying the relevant coasts and the relevant area that includes the
                      potential overlapping entitlements in the continental shelf beyond





8 Ord_1229.indb 224                                                                                   5/12/22 08:27

                      200 nautical miles, as its outer limits are not yet determined. On the iden-
                      tification of the relevant coasts for the outer continental shelf, there are
                      two additional decisions for reference: one is the Judgment rendered by
                      the ITLOS in Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Bay of Bengal
                      (Bangladesh/Myanmar) and the other is the award of the Bay of Bengal
                      Maritime Boundary Arbitration (Bangladesh v. India). In the latter case,
                      the parties requested the Arbitral Tribunal to delimit the full course of
                      their maritime boundary, including the continental shelf beyond 200 nau-
                      tical miles. With regard to the relationship between the relevant coasts of
                      the continental shelf within 200 nautical miles and those of the continen-
                      tal shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, the Arbitral Tribunal observed that
                      “the coast is relevant, irrespective of whether that overlap occurs within
                      200 nm of both coasts, beyond 200 nm of both coasts, or within 200 nm
                      of one and beyond 200 nm of the other” (Award of 7 July 2014, RIAA,
                      Vol. XXXII, p. 93, para. 299). That is to say, the relevant coasts for the
                      delimitation within 200 nautical miles are the same as those for the
                      delimitation beyond 200 nautical miles (ibid., p. 94, paras. 300‑302;
                      ­
                      Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/
                      Myanmar), Judgment, ITLOS Reports 2012, pp. 58‑59, paras. 200‑205). It
                      follows that in the present case, the coasts identified are relevant irrespec-
                      tive of whether the continental shelf is within 200 nautical miles or
                      beyond. Notwithstanding that identification, nevertheless it remains
                      problematic to use radial projection to identify the relevant area.

                         12. In the present case, it is evident that all the overlapping entitle-
                      ments of the Parties could be generated from the coasts of the Parties
                      within 200 nautical miles. If frontal projections were used, the relevant
                      coasts of the Parties would extend on each side of the land boundary
                      terminus for a 200‑nautical‑mile distance and the relevant area would
                      extend south-­eastward perpendicular to the relevant coasts to the limit of
                      200 nautical miles, and further down to the limit of 350 nautical miles as
                      claimed by Kenya. In the south, the relevant area is confined by the per-
                      pendicular line and the boundary agreed between Kenya and Tanzania,
                      and extends along the boundary until the 350‑nautical‑mile limit as
                      claimed by Kenya (see sketch‑map below, p. 321). In my opinion, the
                      area thus identified would better present the potential overlapping entitle-
                      ments of the Parties. Regardless of the fact that the Court does not pos-
                      sess the necessary information of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
                      miles, its decision to extend the adjusted equidistance line beyond 200
                      nautical miles could be sustained only if the outer continental shelf is
                      presumed to exist. One may argue that this approach may deviate from
                      the conventional practice of the Court, but the approach taken by the
                      Court itself is not “conventional”. To omit the continental shelf beyond
                      200 nautical miles from the relevant area would not enable the Court to
                      conduct a meaningful assessment of the proportion between the ratio of



                         13. The second important aspect that I would like to raise is the con-
                      sideration of the relevant circumstances. As the Court states in the Judg-
                      ment, the concept of relevant circumstances is not provided in the
                      Convention but developed through judicial practice (Judgment,
                      para. 124). The reason why, so far, there is no exhaustive list of relevant
                      circumstances that have been developed by the Court in maritime delimi-
                      tation is not difficult to explain. Geographical, economic and social situ-
                      ations of States differ greatly. There may be historic rights or special
                      interests to be preserved or protected by international law. Maritime
                      delimitation is not just about the sharing of a maritime area. The underly-
                      ing interests often rest at the heart of the dispute between the parties.
                      When the equidistance method alone cannot fulfil the objective of achiev-
                      ing an equitable solution in all circumstances, the equitable principles
                      should come into play. In essence, the second stage is a crucial means to
                      ensure the equitableness of the final result of the delimitation. If anything,
                      this should be the strength of the three‑stage approach.

                         14. The Court, as the adjudicator, is obliged to take all the relevant
                      circumstances into consideration, on the basis of the evidence and docu-
                      ments adduced by the parties. What circumstance is relevant and what is
                      not must be appreciated by the Court in the context of a specific case.
                      They cannot be predetermined or preset by certain criteria. As Judge
                      Weeramantry pointed out, “one can never foretell what circumstances
                      may surface or achieve importance in the unknown disputes of the future”
                      (Maritime Delimitation in the Area between Greenland and Jan Mayen
                      (Denmark v. Norway), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1993, separate opinion
                      of Judge Weeramantry, p. 261, para. 182). The Court might be easily
                      criticized for “excessive subjectivity” in its judgment of such circum-
                      stances, but there are good reasons for the Court to maintain its appre-
                      ciation of the subject‑matter. For judicial settlement, even if it cannot be
                      precluded that there are situations where the parties may use the

                                                               Relevant coasts and relevant area



                       open‑endedness of the concept to make excessive claims, it is up to the
                       Court to consider the circumstances and determine what factors to be
                       taken into account in accordance with the equitable principles. So far, the
                       Court has attached legal relevance primarily to geographical circum-
                       stances — such as cut‑off effect, concavity and convexity, special insular
                       features — which could produce distorting effects on the maritime delim-
                       itation. Non‑geographical factors have seldom been accepted by the
                       Court as relevant circumstances, although in principle they are not pre-
                       cluded in the jurisprudence of the Court. This tendency in practice, if
                       continued, would likely render the second stage into a purely geometrical
                       exercise, with a few fixed geophysical factors for the Court to consider,
                       thus reducing the discretion of the Court in its appreciation of the situa-
                       tion. Eventually, the three‑stage approach would in effect evolve into a
                       substitute of the equidistance method and the equitable principles would
                       vanish from the process of delimitation.

                        15. The fear that the boundless proliferation of relevant circumstances
                      would open up a risk of assimilating judgments based on law to those
                      rendered ex aequo et bono, in my view, is unfounded, because the notion
                      of relevant circumstances itself is judicially developed and applied. As the
                      Court stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, “when mention is
                      made of a court dispensing justice or declaring the law, what is meant is
                      that the decision finds its objective justification in considerations lying not
                      outside but within the rules” ((Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark;
                      Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      1969, p. 48, para. 88). The margin of appreciation is to be exercised by the
                      Court, not the parties. Coupled with that discretion, of course, is the
                      responsibility of the adjudicating organ, court or arbitral tribunal, to act
                      reasonably and fairly in the delimitation in accordance with the equitable
                      principles.

                         16. In the present case, Kenya has raised five factors as the relevant
                      circumstances for the adjustment of the equidistance line, including sig-
                      nificant cut‑off effect, regional practice of using parallels of latitude to
                      delimit maritime boundaries, vital security interests, long‑standing con-
                      duct of the Parties in relation to oil concessions, naval patrols and fishing
                      activities, and the impact on the local fisherfolk. The Court rejects all the
                      factors but cut‑off effect. Here I fully concur with the reasoning of the
                      Court with regard to the geographical circumstances in the region con-
                      cerned and the cut‑off effect produced by the equidistance line (Judgment,
                      paras. 162-171). Sketch-map No. 10 in the Judgment (p. 269) well illus-
                      trates the effect of the concavity of the coastline on the delimitation of the
                      maritime boundaries among the three States — Somalia, Kenya and Tan-
                      zania. This is a textbook case where the equidistance method could not
                      produce an equitable solution. The equidistance line between Kenya and
                      Tanzania and the equidistance line between Kenya and Somalia both
                      work to the disadvantage of Kenya and, as a result, the Kenyan coast
                      could not produce its effect to a significant extent in terms of its maritime
                      entitlements. As the narrowing effect on Kenya comes from both the
                      northern and southern directions, it is reasonable to make an adjustment
                      in both directions. Such adjustment of the equidistance lines does not give
                      rise to the refashioning of geography. On the contrary, it will rectify the
                      unreasonableness of the equidistance lines, ensuring a fair sharing of
                      the disputed area, which serves the interests of the States concerned in the
                      long run. The maritime boundary agreed between Kenya and Tanzania,
                      as indicated on sketch-map No. 10 of the Judgment (p. 269), has over-
                      come the cut‑off effect to the extent the parties deem reasonable and
                      appropriate. With regard to the equidistance line between Somalia and
                      Kenya, it is for the Court to determine to what extent the line should be
                      adjusted.
                         17. Between Somalia and Kenya, if all the other factors presented by
                      Kenya are dismissed as non‑relevant, one may wonder, other than the
                      proportionality consideration, on what basis the Court could rely to

                      adjust the provisional equidistance line. With the cut‑off effect, I am quite
                      persuaded by, and satisfied with, the reasoning of the Judgment for the
                      necessity to adjust the equidistance line, but I am not contented with the
                      way in which the adjustment is done, which brings me to the last point I
                      wish to address.

                         18. In paragraph 174 of the Judgment, the Court decides to shift the
                      line northwards to an initial azimuth of 114°, in the view that this line
                      would offset the cut‑off effect produced by the concavity of the coastal
                      line. Without much explanation as to the reason for this adjustment, the
                      Court moves on to the last stage to verify the result. According to the
                      three‑stage methodology, at the final stage, the Court will check whether
                      the adjusted line leads to a significant disproportionality between the
                      ratio of the lengths of the Parties’ respective relevant coasts and the ratio
                      of the sizes of the relevant area apportioned by that line. According to the
                      Court’s calculation, the ratio of the relevant coasts between Somalia and
                      Kenya is 1:1.43 in favour of Somalia and the ratio of the apportioned
                      spaces is 1:1.30 in favour of Kenya. The Court is of the view that [a] com-
                      parison of these two ratios does not reveal any significant or marked dis-
                      proportionality” (Judgment, para. 176).

                         19. On the face of the figures, no one can seriously challenge the con-
                      clusion of the Court. However, if the identification of the relevant coasts,
                      as has been pointed out before, follows a different method, the propor-
                      tionality of the ratio of the coastal lengths of the Parties and the ratio of
                      the maritime areas apportioned to the Parties, respectively, will be differ-
                      ent. As the following sketch‑maps (p. 324) illustrate, the maritime areas
                      apportioned to the Parties in the maritime area within 200 nautical miles
                      are approximately equal, not so favourable to Kenya as stated by the
                      Court. The difference in size between the Parties is getting bigger in the
                      outer continental shelf, in favour of Somalia, provided the outer limits of
                      the continental shelves beyond 200 nautical miles as claimed by the Par-
                      ties are ultimately confirmed by the CLCS.

                         20. For years, international courts and tribunals did not reach agree-
                      ment on the term “a significant disproportionality”, a criterion that
                      assesses the equitableness of the outcome of maritime delimitation. Under
                      the three‑stage approach, the disproportionality test is designed to check,
                      ex post facto, the final result. According to the Court, the disproportion-
                      ality test is not in itself a method of delimitation; rather, it is a means of
                      checking whether the delimitation line arrived at by other means needs
                      adjustment because of a significant disproportionality in the ratios
                      between the maritime areas which would fall to one party or other by
                      virtue of the delimitation line arrived at by other means, and the lengths
                      of their respective coasts (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Roma‑
                      nia v. Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, pp. 99‑100, para. 110).
                      This distinct status and role of the disproportionality test is sound in
