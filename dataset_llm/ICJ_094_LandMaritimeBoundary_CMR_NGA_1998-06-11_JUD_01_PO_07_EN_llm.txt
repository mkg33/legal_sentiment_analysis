In its reply to the first preliminary objection by Nigeria that the Court
has not been invested with jurisdiction to entertain the Application by
Cameroon, as the condition precedent for the Applicant to invoke
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute had not been met, the Court, in
rejecting the objection, held that the manner in which Cameroon’s Appli-
cation was lodged was not contrary to Article 36 of the Statute, nor was
it made in violation of any right which Nigeria may claim under the Stat-
ute or by virtue of its Declaration; and that in any event it has jurisdic-
tion to pass upon Cameroon’s Application. Since I strongly disagree with
the holding that the manner of lodging the Application was consistent
with the mandatory requirements of Article 36 of the Statute, that it was
not made in violation of Nigeria’s rights under the Statute, and that in
any event the Court has jurisdiction to pass upon Cameroon’s Applica-
tion, I feel it incumbent upon me to set out the basis of my disagreement.

My view is that, in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, two mandatory requirements
must have been fulfilled. First, a State must have made a declaration that
it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in
relation to any other State accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction
of the Court in all legal disputes which fall under that provision. Second,
such a declaration should be deposited with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, who is obliged to transmit copies thereof to the parties
to the Statute and to the Registrar of the Court.

As stated earlier, the Court rejected this line of reasoning and reached
the conclusion that it has jurisdiction to pass upon Cameroon’s Applica-
tion. In reaching this conclusion, the Court overwhelmingly and substan-
tively relied on the Judgment it had rendered in the case concerning Right
of Passage over Indian Territory (Preliminary Objections, I. C.J. Reports
1957, p. 125).

While it is understandable that the Court should seek guidance from
its previous decisions, one of the disturbing aspects of the present Judg-
ment would seem to be the reluctance or disinclination on the part of the
Court to undertake a juristic and judicial enquiry or examination of the
meaning of Article 36 of the Statute — the meaning of which has been in
contention between the two Parties in this first preliminary objection. To
reinforce and justify its overwhelming reliance on the Right of Passage
case, the Court in turn cited those cases which had been decided on the
basis of the decision in the Right of Passage case, as justification for its
reasoning in the present case. I am not sure whether in fact much has
been gained in terms of legal clarity or in the dispensation of justice by
this method of judicial accretion, as a judicial response to this particular

Moreover, it is an important principle of this Court that it does not
recognize the principle of stare decisis — the principle of binding pre-
cedent does not apply in the Court. It is also part of the Court’s juris-
prudence that even when legal principles are accepted by the Court in a
particular case, they are not regarded as binding upon. other States or in
other disputes. The Court has the power and the duty to depart from pre-
vious decisions when this is necessary and in the interests of justice. To
my mind, the present case before it is just such a case.

With regard to this case, it should be recalled that Article 38 of the
Statute provides that the Court in deciding disputes should do so in
accordance with international law, and should apply:

“(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, estab-
lishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting States;

(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions . . . as
subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.”

In other words the Article establishes a hierarchy as to the application
of the law, and the Court is called upon to determine — to find out —
what the existing law is in respect of the dispute before it and to apply
that law. The Court has, on the whole, shown a tendency to develop the
law, to interpret the law and not to consider itself burdened or bound by
previous decisions.

It is a well-established principle of international law, and one accepted
by the Court’s jurisprudence, that the jurisdiction of the Court is based
on consent. In other words, a State may not be compelled to submit to
the jurisdiction of the Court without its consent. In this regard, for the
Court to assume jurisdiction on the basis of a declaration made under
Article 36 of the Statute, the Court has to ensure that jurisdiction has
been conferred on it; such conferment cannot be presumed. Article 36,
paragraphs 2 and 4, provide as follows:

“2. The States parties to the present Statute may at any time
declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without
special agreement, in relation to any other State accepting the same



obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concern-
ing:

(a) the interpretation of a treaty;

(b) any question of international law;

{c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
a breach of an international obligation;

(d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach
of an international obligation.

4. Such declarations shall be deposited with the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, who shall transmit copies thereof to
the parties to the Statute and to the Registrar of the Court.”

When this provision is interpreted and given its plain and natural
meaning, it follows that, for a State to be in a position to invoke the juris-
diction of the Court, under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute and to
seise the Court of a matter, it must first of all have made a declaration
recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court; such a declaration must have
been deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who
should have transmitted copies thereof to the parties to the Statute and to
the Registrar of the Court.

The Court, in attempting to distinguish the deposit and transmission of
a declaration pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 4, of the Statute from the
régime laid down for treaties by the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, stated that Article 78 of the Convention is only designed to lay
down the modalities according to which notifications and communica-
tions should be carried out; that the provision does not govern the con-
ditions in which a State expresses its consent to be bound and those
under which a treaty comes into force. This attempted distinction, it
would seem to me, missed the point of Nigeria’s contention with refer-
ence to that Article. Article 78 provides as follows:

“Except as the treaty or the present Convention otherwise pro-
vide, any notification or communication to be made by any State
under the present Convention shall:

(c) if transmitted to a depositary, be considered as received by the
State for which it was intended only when the latter State has
been informed by the depositary . . .”.



According to Nigeria, that rule “must apply to Cameroon’s Declara-
tion”.

Nigeria had argued that, since 1957, the trend in international law has
been that where a State makes a treaty-related communication to a
depositary for transmission to other States, those other States are only to
be considered to have received it when they have been informed of it by
the depositary acting in fulfilment of its obligation to inform other States
of such communications; and that, although a declaration made under
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute is not a treaty as such, to the
extent that both Parties are in agreement that such a declaration is to be
treated as a treaty, then Cameroon’s Declaration, made after the Vienna
Convention entered into force, is subject to that provision.

For the Court to dismiss this contention by saying that Article 78 (c)
does not govern the conditions in which a State expresses its consent to
be bound, and those under which a treaty comes into force, does not con-
stitute a proper response to the submission that, as the law has devel-
oped, other States are to be deemed as having received communications
relating to a treaty only if the obligation to transmit has been fulfilled. As
the Court is aware, consent to be bound by a treaty can be established
either upon the exchange of instruments between the States parties, on
their deposit with the depositary, or on their notification to the States
parties or to the depositary. In the case of multilateral treaties, to which
declarations made under the Statute can be likened in nature, the law as
it has developed is that transmission of a treaty cannot be deemed to
have taken place until the depositary has forwarded it to the other States.
It is for this reason that Articles 16 and 24 of the Vienna Convention
must be construed in the light of Article 78 (c) of the Vienna Convention
of the Law of Treaties of 1969 and the principles it enunciated. In other
words, declarations made under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of
the Court can only be deemed to have established the consensual link
between the relevant States for the purpose of the Court’s jurisdiction
after they have been transmitted by the Secretary-General.


Nigeria objected that Cameroon could not file an application before
the Court without allowing a reasonable period to elapse “as would . . .
have enabled the Secretary-General to take the action required of him in
relation to Cameroon’s Declaration of 3 March 1994”. Nigeria, in advan-
cing this view, had relied on the Court’s Judgment of 26 November 1984
in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against
Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), in which the Court
stated that a reasonable time is required for the withdrawal of declara-
tions under the Optional Clause. In that case the Court stated, inter alia,
that

“the right of immediate termination of declarations with indefinite
duration is far from established. It appears from the requirements of
good faith that they should be treated, by analogy, according to the
law of treaties, which requires a reasonable time for withdrawal
from or termination of treaties that contain no provision regarding
the duration of their validity.” (I. C.J. Reports 1984, p. 420,
para. 63.)

The Court considers that in this case “no time period is required” to
establish a consensual bond, as opposed to a withdrawal which would
bring such a bond to an end. This conclusion by the Court would seem to
be at variance with the evolution of the law. Nowadays, and in spite of
the Judgment in the Right of Passage case, international legal instru-
ments tend to impose a time period for them to take effect after they have
been ratified and deposited. Moreover, the conclusion of the Court when
examined closely does not appear to respond to the objection as formu-
lated. The objection was not that a reasonable time was required for the
establishment of a consensual bond, but that Cameroon should not have
filed its Application before the Court without allowing a reasonable
period “as would have enabled the Secretary-General to take action
required of him in relation to Cameroon’s Declaration of 3 March 1994”.
In other words, when could a State that has made a declaration under the
Optional Clause seise the Court? One would have thought that both
under the Statute and in conformity with legal principles, a reasonable
time period would be required before the Court could be seised. In the



first place, under the Statute itself, a reasonable time will be required to
enable the Secretary-General to transmit copies of the Declaration to the
other States parties to the Optional Clause as well as to the Registrar.
Secondly, if only to prevent the allegation of bad faith, a State would
surely not wish to be seen to be seising the Court so soon after it had
deposited its Declaration that the Secretary-General had not had time to
carry out his statutory duty.

Thirdly, if a reasonable time period is not to be required for the trans-
mission of a declaration before the filing of an action, the other States
parties to the Optional Clause would not be in a position of knowing that
such a deposit has been made, that the declarant State is entitled to exer-
cise its right, or that the other States parties to the Statute have had such
a right conferred on them and are entitled to exercise such a right as well.
Hence, in my view, both under the Statute and from a position of prin-
ciple, a reasonable time is required after the deposit of a declaration
before the Court may be seised. Related to this matter is Nigeria’s con-
tention that, even while continuing, during the first three months of 1994,
to maintain contacts with it on boundary questions, Cameroon was in
fact preparing to seise the Court. Such conduct, Nigeria contends,
infringes the principle of good faith and should not be accepted.

In answer to this contention, the Court stated, inter alia, and referred
to its dictum in the Right of Passage case, that “ ‘the principle of recipro-
city is not affected by any delay in the receipt of copies of the Declaration
by the Parties to the Statute’ (Right of Passage over Indian Territory,
Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 147” (Judg-
ment, para. 43).

Such response, with respect, does not seem to meet this particular
objection of Nigeria. As I understand it, the complaint is not about the
delay as such, but one of substance, namely, that reciprocity under the
Optional Clause should ensure jurisdictional equality. To the extent that
an application had been filed against a Party, but one which was not in a
position to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court had it felt the need to do
so — to that extent, the jurisdictional equality which should exist between
the two Parties had not existed. Nigeria claims that, until it was informed
by the Registrar of the Application filed by Cameroon, it was not in a
position to file a claim against Cameroon, as it could not have been
aware that Cameroon had become a party to the Optional Clause system.
It seems as if the proviso had envisaged this problem and solved it by
enjoining the Secretary-General to perform his statutory function of



transmitting a declaration, and, since this would allow for the receipt or
acceptance of that declaration, reciprocal equality between the Parties
would have thus been established.

It may be argued that the lapse of a reasonable time before a declara-
tion would be allowed to take effect would allow a State to modify its
declaration. The customary norm governing the modification is that a
declaration cannot be modified after a dispute has developed. According
to the Court, as stated in the Nottebohm case:

“At the time when the Application was filed, the Declarations of
Guatemala and of Liechtenstein were both in force. The regularity
of the seising of the Court by this Application has not been disputed.
The subsequent lapse of the Declaration of Guatemala, by reason of
the expiry of the period for which it was subscribed, cannot invali-
date the Application if the latter was regular: consequently, the lapse
of the Declaration cannot deprive the Court of the jurisdiction
which resulted from the combined application of Article 36 of the
Statute and the two Declarations.

An extrinsic fact such as the subsequent lapse of the Declaration
. . . by denunciation, cannot deprive the Court of the jurisdiction
already established.” (Nottebohm, Preliminary Objection, Judgment,
L C.J. Reports 1953, pp. 122-123.)

To sum up on this point, since Nigeria’s Declaration under Article 36,
paragraph 2, of the Statute was based on reciprocity, for there to have
been reciprocal equality with Cameroon, Nigeria should have been in a
position in which, had it wanted to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court at
the same time as Cameroon filed its Application, it would have been able
to do so. According to the material before the Court, it was not in a posi-
tion to exercise such a right had it wished to do so, hence the element of
reciprocal equality and mutuality was absent. The jurisdiction of the
Court cannot be imposed on a State against its clearly expressed will.

Nigeria, in its submissions, had also asked the Court to declare that the
claims brought by the Republic of Cameroon are inadmissible to the
extent specified in the preliminary objections an objection based on law
and fact; in other words for the Court to rule on the Application other
than on its ultimate merits.

In my view, while making such a ruling, one way or the other, the Court
should have resisted the temptation of what could be read as taking
a position on the merits of the matter, which is still in the preliminary
objection phase. As I understand the material presented to the Court, to
rule on whether the entire boundary between the countries is contested or
whether or not the Court is in a position to delimit the maritime bound-
ary when the rights of third countries could be involved would not have
required entering into the merits of the dispute. In paragraph 109 of the
Judgment the Court should have made it clear that the Court’s jurisdic-



tion cannot be established on the basis of a declaration made under
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, if such a declaration would be con-
trary to the provisions of or obligations undertaken in a prior treaty
otherwise than in conditions laid down in that treaty. On the other hand,
I am constrained to note that, by some of its holdings, the Court would
appear to have gone too far in taking positions which may appear preju-
dicial when it reaches the merits phase of the matter and would in that
regard have crossed the threshold on a matter which is still at the juris-
dictional and admissibility phase. There is a general recognition in the
jurisprudence of the Court that, during the preliminary phase of a matter
before it, the Court could not pre-empt — even in a remote way —
its order, judgment or advisory opinion on the merits of a case when
deciding questions of jurisdiction.
