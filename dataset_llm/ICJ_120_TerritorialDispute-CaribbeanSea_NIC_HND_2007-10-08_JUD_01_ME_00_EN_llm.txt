    THE COURT,
    composed as above,
    after deliberation,
    delivers the following Judgment :
  1. On 8 December 1999 the Republic of Nicaragua (hereinafter “Nicara-
gua”) filed in the Registry of the Court an Application dated the same day,
instituting proceedings against the Republic of Honduras (hereinafter “Hondu-
ras”) in respect of a dispute relating to the delimitation of the maritime areas
appertaining to each of those States in the Caribbean Sea.



   In its Application, Nicaragua seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on
the provisions of Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement,
officially designated, according to Article LX thereof, as the “Pact of Bogotá”
(hereinafter referred to as such), as well as on the declarations accepting the
jurisdiction of the Court made by the Parties, as provided for in Article 36,
paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court.
   2. Pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Registrar imme-
diately communicated a certified copy of the Application to the Government of
Honduras ; and pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article, all States entitled to
appear before the Court were notified of the Application.
   3. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of
Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the Pact of Bogotá the noti-
fications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court. In
accordance with the provisions of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of
Court, the Registrar moreover addressed to the Organization of American
States (hereinafter “OAS”) the notification provided for in Article 34, para-
graph 3, of the Statute. The Registrar subsequently transmitted to this organi-
zation copies of the pleadings filed in the case and asked its Secretary-General
to inform him whether or not it intended to present observations in writing
within the meaning of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court. The OAS
indicated that it did not intend to submit any such observations.
   4. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of
Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the United Nations Conven-
tion on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (hereinafter “UNCLOS”) the
notifications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute. In addi-
tion, the Registrar addressed to the European Union, which is also party to
that Convention, the notification provided for in Article 43, paragraph 2, of the
Rules of Court, as adopted on 29 September 2005, and asked that organization
whether or not it intended to furnish observations under that provision. In
response, the Registrar was informed that the European Union did not intend
to submit observations in the case.

   5. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
either of the Parties, each Party proceeded to exercise its right conferred by
Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the
case. Nicaragua chose Mr. Giorgio Gaja and Honduras first chose Mr. Julio
González Campos, who resigned on 17 August 2006, and subsequently Mr. San-
tiago Torres Bernárdez.
   6. By an Order dated 21 March 2000, the President of the Court fixed
21 March 2001 and 21 March 2002, respectively, as the time-limits for the filing
of the Memorial of Nicaragua and the Counter-Memorial of Honduras ; those
pleadings were duly filed within the time-limits so prescribed.
   7. At the time of filing of the Counter-Memorial, Honduras also filed two
sets of additional documents which were not produced as annexes thereto, but
were, according to Honduras, provided only for informational purposes. At a
meeting held by the President of the Court with the Agents of the Parties on
5 June 2002 both Parties agreed on the procedure to be followed with regard to
those additional documents. In particular, it was agreed that within three weeks
following that meeting, Honduras would inform the Registry which of the
additional documents it intended to produce as annexes to the said Counter-
Memorial under Article 50 of the Rules of Court, and that by 13 Septem-
ber 2002 Honduras would file those annexes in the Registry. In accordance



with the agreed procedure, by a letter of 25 June 2002, the Co-Agent of Hon-
duras provided the Registry with a list indicating which of the additional docu-
ments were to be produced as annexes. Those additional annexes to the Coun-
ter-Memorial of Honduras were duly filed within the time-limit agreed upon.
   8. By an Order of 13 June 2002, the Court authorized the submission of a
Reply by Nicaragua and a Rejoinder by Honduras, and fixed 13 January 2003
and 13 August 2003 as the respective time-limits for the filing of those plead-
