In addition to the joint declaration, which reflects my disagreement
with the grounds which led the Court to conclude that it had no jurisdic-
tion in the instant case, I deem it necessary to elaborate further on some
aspects. At the outset, I would like to emphasize that regardless of the
conclusion that the Court reaches on the issue of jurisdiction, and not-
withstanding the fact that the Judgment is confined to deciding on juris-
diction, the Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,
is always called upon to uphold the law of the Charter. The Court, how-
ever, confined its conclusion in the instant case to noting, in para-
graph 127 of the Judgment, that:

“When, however, as in the present case, the Court comes to the
conclusion that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the claims made
in the Application, it can make no finding, nor any observation
whatever, on the question whether any such violation has been com-
mitted or any international responsibility incurred.”

On this point I am inclined to favour the balance reached by the Court in
the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, where it held that:

1. The Court finds that it has no jurisdiction in this case because the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)! did not have access to the Court
at the time it filed its Application. The first ground upon which the
Court makes this finding is Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
Court.

2. Article 35, paragraph 1, provides that “[t]he Court shall be open to
the States parties to the present Statute”. Under Article 93, paragraph 1,
of the United Nations Charter, all “Members of the United Nations are
ipso facto [States] parties”. The Court holds that the FRY was not a
State party to the Statute because the FRY was not a Member of the
United Nations at the time it filed its Application in the instant case, and
therefore, in the view of the Court, the Court was not “open” to the
FRY. Because, in my view, the FRY was a Member of the United
Nations when it filed its Application, I disagree.

tively (United Nations doc. A/RES/49/19B) and 0.060, 0.034 and 0.026 per cent for the

“Resolution 47/1 did not deprive the FRY of all the attributes of
United Nations membership: the only practical consequence was its
inability to participate in the work of the General Assembly, its sub-
sidiary organs, conferences or meetings convened by it. Apart from
that, it continued to function as a member of the United Nations in
many areas of the work of the United Nations . . . Thus, while the
FRY’s membership was lost for certain purposes, it was retained for
others . . . The proper approach to the issue of the FRY membership
of the United Nations in the period between 1992 and 2000 is not
one that proceeds on a[n] a priori, doctrinaire assumption that its
exclusion from participation in the work of the General Assembly
necessarily meant that it was no longer a member of the United
Nations. As the FRY membership was neither terminated nor sus-
pended by General Assembly resolution 47/1, it is more appropriate
to make a determination of its United Nations membership in that
period on an empirical, functional and case-by-case basis.” 8

FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United Nations over the period
1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court”

govina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections ( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia

emphasis added).

2. Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute provides that:

“The conditions under which the Court shall be open to other
States shall, subject to the special provisions contained in treaties in
force, be laid down by the Security Council, but in no case shall such
conditions place the parties in a position of inequality before the
Court.”

3. There are two questions relevant to an Article 35, paragraph 2,
examination: first, whether a “treaty in force” may provide a basis for the
Court’s jurisdiction instead of, rather than in combination with, compli-
ance with the requirements laid down by the Security Council in its reso-
lution 9 of 1946; and second, whether the Genocide Convention can be
considered a “treaty in force”.

12 Although the Court is free to decide the issues submitted to it by the Parties for
reasons other than those advanced by the Parties, it is undesirable as a matter of judicial
policy for the Court to raise proprio motu a legal argument that is not determinative of
one of the Applicant’s submissions, unless there are “compelling considerations of inter-
national justice and of development of international law which favour a full measure of
exhaustiveness” on the matter. Compare Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.
United States of America), I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 232, para. 27, separate opinion of
Judge Higgins (“it is unlikely to be ‘desirable’ to deal with important and difficult matters,
which are gratuitous to the determination of a point of law put by the Applicant in its
submissions”) with Lauterpacht, The Development of International Law by the Interna-
tional Court, 1982, p. 37.



4. In respect of the first question, I agree with the Court’s previous
finding that

“proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,

might provide non-League Members access to the Court!”.

Court’s interpretation of “treaties in force” as encompassing only those
treaties which, like the Peace Treaties, were in force before the Statute of
the Court came into force”, a special, broader interpretation of the
expression is appropriate in a case which, like the present case, involves a
multilateral treaty of a universal character which is intended to remedy
violations of jus cogens. On this point, I subscribe to the view of Pro-
fessor Sienho Yee, that in cases involving jus cogens, there is a special
need

“to . . . resolv[e] disputes . . . as soon as possible. As treaties may not
override jus cogens?*, they should not hinder efforts to remedy vio-
lations of jus cogens. Accordingly, the phrase ‘treaties in force’
should be given the broadest scope so as to facilitate any consenting

23 The Court notes in paragraph 112 that, in the context of the present Court, there
were no such treaties in force prior to the Statute.

sovereign State to utilise the Court to resolve any disputes involving
jus cogens.”?5

16. Thus, even if the PCIJ drafters primarily had in mind the special
category of existing peace treaties, to the exclusion of all others, their
original intent should give way, in the context of the ICJ Statute, to a
broader interpretation of “treaties in force” that includes multilateral
treaties addressing jus cogens violations which have largely emerged in
the post-Second World War era.

17. Because of the overriding importance of such treaties to the pro-
gressive development of international law and the maintenance of peace,
they are, and should be, subject to a special interpretation. Cf. Article 60,
paragraph 5, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (non-
applicability of treaty termination rules to “provisions relating to the
protection of the human person contained in treaties of a humanitarian
character”); the Court’s Advisory Opinion on Reservations to the Geno-
cide Convention (limiting ability of States to enter reservations to the
Genocide Convention) (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports
1951, p. 24), and Order on counter-claims in the Application of the Geno-
cide Convention case (limiting applicability of reciprocity rules in context
of Genocide Convention) (Application of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Counter-Claims, Order of
17 December 1997, LC.J. Reports 1997, p. 258, para. 35).


“[Alfter the separation of parts of the territory of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (which became independent States), the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (as the Russian Federation) con-
tinued to exist as a predecessor State, and all its treaty rights and
obligations continued in force in respect of its territory. The same
applies to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Monte-
negro), which remains as the predecessor State upon separation of
parts of the territory of the former Yugoslavia. General Assembly
resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992, to the effect that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia could not automatically continue the
membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations . . . was
adopted within the framework of the United Nations and the con-
text of the Charter of the United Nations, and not as an indication
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was not to be considered a

of Treaties. Article 17, paragraph 1, provides that

“a newly independent State may, by a notification of succession,
establish its status as a party to any multilateral treaty which at the
date of the succession of States was in force in respect of the terri-
tory to which the succession of States relates”.

Article 34 of the Vienna Convention, on the other hand, provides that

“[w]lhen a part or parts of the territory of a State separate to form
one or more States, whether or not the predecessor State continues
to exist:

(a) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect of the entire territory of the predecessor State continues
in force in respect of each successor State so formed[, and]

(b) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect only of that part of the territory of the predecessor State
which has become a successor State continues in force in respect
of that successor State alone”.

5. Thus, there is a difference in international law between a newly
independent State and a successor State. A newly independent State is
required upon independence to clarify its legal position regarding treaties
in conformity with the “clean slate” doctrine codified in Article 17 of the
Vienna Convention. In the case of the separation of States, on the other
hand, the successor State automatically assumes the treaty obligations of
the predecessor.

6. This rule of succession to treaties applies to new States and is

the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), the Court left open the
question whether it accepted the automatic succession argument, and
confined its Judgment to noting that:

“Without prejudice as to whether or not the principle of ‘auto-
matic succession’ applies in the case of certain types of international
treaties or conventions, the Court does not consider it necessary, in
order to decide on its jurisdiction in this case, to make a determina-
tion on the legal issues concerning State succession in respect to trea-
ties which have been raised by the Parties.” (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II),
p. 612, para. 23.)

The time has come for the Court to answer this question and, in my view,
the answer should have been that:

(a) the FRY succeeded to the Genocide Convention on 27 April 1992,
and

in 1996 in respect to Bosnia, that

“[s]ince the Court has concluded that Bosnia and Herzegovina could
become a party to the Genocide Convention as a result of a succes-



sion, the question of the application of Articles XI and XIII of
the Convention does not arise” (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 612,
para. 24; emphasis added)

and made the same finding in respect of the FRY. The FRY became a
party to the Genocide Convention “as a result of a succession” and as a
result the Convention provides a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction ratione
personae.

V. CONCLUSION

The FRY had every right to claim the continuity of the legal person-
ality of its predecessor with respect of the territory of Serbia and Mon-
tenegro. In the FRY’s case, however, the competent United Nations
organs opted to disregard the law of the Charter. The legal consequences
of the FRY’s “sui generis” status vis-à-vis the United Nations — it was
excluded from participating in certain activities of specified organs but
was never expelled — were not, in my view, properly addressed by the
Court. As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court’s
function under Article 38 of its Statute is to decide disputes in accordance
with international law. It has been in a position more than once in the
last decade to set the record straight regarding the legal status of the
FRY’s membership in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.



Yet the Court, in holding that it “is led to the conclusion that Serbia and
Montenegro was not a Member of the United Nations . . . at the time of
filing its Application” did not address in a comprehensive manner “the
legal situation [regarding the FRY’s membership status], which was
shrouded in uncertainties” (Judgment, para. 78).

For this and other reasons set out in my opinion, I disagree with the
findings of the Court regarding the interpretation of Article 35, para-
graph 1, which the joint declaration correctly describes as being “at
odds” with the Court’s previous judgments and orders. I also do not
agree with the grounds chosen by the Court to reach its decision that
it lacks jurisdiction or its substantive conclusions on the scope of
Article 35, paragraph 2. Moreover I find that the approach adopted
by the Court casts an unnecessary shadow of doubt on the Genocide Con-
vention case which has been on the docket of the Court since 1993.

However, because I consider that the Court does not have jurisdiction
ratione materiae, 1 find myself in agreement with the dispositif contained
in paragraph 128 of the Judgment, which states that the Court “//Jinds
that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the Application
filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999”. 1 was therefore able
to vote in favour of the Judgment.
