       1. I have voted in favour of the adoption today, 24 September 2015, of the present Judgment
on Preliminary Objection in the case concerning the Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific
Ocean, between Bolivia and Chile, whereby the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has found that
it has jurisdiction to consider the claim lodged with it under Article XXXI of the 1948 American
Treaty on Pacific Settlement (Pact of Bogotá). Yet, there are certain aspects of the question
decided by the Court, to which I attribute importance for its proper understanding, which are not
properly reflected in the reasoning of the present Judgment. I feel thus obliged to dwell upon them,
in the present Separate Opinion.

       2. In particular, I find the treatment dispensed by the ICJ in the present Judgment, to the
jurisdictional regime of the Pact of Bogotá, and in particular to the basis of its own jurisdiction
(Article XXXI of the Pact) (paras. 37 and 54) as well as to the relevant provision (Article 79 (9)) of
the Rules of Court (paras. 52-53), far too succinct. In order to rest on a more solid ground, the
Court should, in my perception, have dwelt further upon those provisions, faced as it was with the
contention that the respondent State’s characterization of the subject-matter of the present dispute
would amount to a refutation of the applicant State’s case on the merits (para. 52).


       3. The ICJ should, in my perception, have devoted as much attention to Article XXXI of the
Pact and Article 79 (9) of the Rules of Court as it did as to Article VI of the Pact (paras. 24
and 38-50). In the present Separate Opinion, I deem it fit to stress the importance of the
aforementioned provisions, in relation to the factual context of the cas d’espèce and the handling of
the question lodged with the Court. To that effect I shall develop my considerations that follow. I
shall begin by addressing the reasoning, in search of justice, as to preliminary objections and the
merits.


       4. I shall next consider the relation between the jurisdictional basis and the merits in the
case-law of the Hague Court (PCIJ and ICJ), focusing, earlier on, on the joinder of preliminary
objections to the merits, and then on the not exclusively “preliminary” character of objections to
jurisdiction (and admissibility). I shall then dwell upon the relevance of general principles of
international procedural law, as related to the foundations of the international legal order, and on
their incidence, in contentious cases, on distinct incidental proceedings (preliminary objections,
provisional measures, counter-claims and intervention), on the joinder of proceedings, as well as on
advisory proceedings.


       5. After an assessment of the matter, I shall proceed to consider the general principles of
international law, Latin American doctrine and the significance of the 1948 Pact of Bogotá. Last
but not least, the way will then be paved for the presentation of my concluding observations on the
third way (troisième voie/tercera vía) devised by Article 79 (9) of the Rules of Court, namely, that
of the determination of an objection not of an exclusively preliminary character, leading to the
opening of further proceedings and moving into the merits of the case.


                      II. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS AND MERITS: REASONING
                                     IN SEARCH OF JUSTICE

       6. In effect, may I begin by pointing out that a clear cut separation between the procedural
stages of preliminary objections and merits reflects the old voluntarist-positivist conception of
international justice subjected to State consent. Yet, despite the prevalence of the positivist
approach in the era of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), soon the old Hague
Court reckoned the need to join a preliminary objection to the merits (cf. infra). A preliminary
objection to jurisdiction ratione materiae is more likely to appear related to the merits of a case
than an objection to jurisdiction ratione personae or ratione temporis1. I shall seek to clarify this in
my considerations that follow.


       7. In effect, to start with, the search for justice transcends any straight-jacket conception of
international legal procedure. In my Dissenting Opinion in the ICJ’s Judgment on Preliminary


            Cf., to this effect, F. Ammoun, “La jonction des exceptions préliminaires au fond en Droit international
public”, in Il processo internazionale  Studi in onore di G. Morelli, 14 Comunicazioni e Studi (1975) pp. 34 and 38,
and cf. p. 21.

                                                           -3-

Objections of 01.04.2011 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia versus Russian Federation), I laid
down in depth my criticisms of the voluntarist approach to the Court’s jurisdiction. As I do not
purport to retake here the consideration of this particular issue, I limit myself to refer to the
pertinent passages of my aforementioned Dissenting Opinion (paras. 37-63, 79-87, 140, 167
and 181) in this respect.


       8. Moreover, in the handling of this issue, the Hague Court (PCIJ and ICJ) has, throughout
its history, been attentive to the interests of the parties and the preservation of the equilibrium
between them in the course of the procedure. Hence the constant recourse by the Court to the
principle of the sound administration of justice (la bonne administration de la justice); the
acknowledgment of this principle, in the course of incidental proceedings of the ICJ, has further
had repercussion in contemporary expert writing2.

                             1. Joinder of Preliminary Objections to the Merits

       12. Early in its history, the old PCIJ decided to join preliminary objections to the merits of
the cases. It did so, for the first time, in the Administration of the Prince von Pless case (Order
of 04.02.1933), wherein it stated that the question before it concerned the merits of the case, and
thus it could not pass upon “the question of jurisdiction until the case ha[d] been argued upon the
merits” (p. 15); it decided to join Poland’s preliminary objection to the merits (p. 16).


      13. In the same decade, the PCIJ, in the cases Pajzs, Csáky and Esterházy (Order
of 23.05.1936), having found the questions raised in Yugoslavia’s objections “too intimately” and
“too closely interconnected” with Hungary’s submissions on the merits, ordered likewise the
joinder of those objections to the merits (p. 9). Likewise, shortly afterwards, in the Losinger (Order
of 27.06.1936), the PCIJ again ordered the joinder, having found that the plea to the jurisdiction
appeared as a “defence on the merits” (pp. 23-24). And the PCIJ, once more, ordered the joinder of
preliminary objections to the merits in the aforementioned Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway case
(Order of 30.06.1938, pp. 55-56).


      14. For its part, the ICJ, in the handling of subsequent cases, was soon also faced with
circumstances which led it to determine the joinder of a preliminary objection of the merits. Thus,
in the case of Certain Norwegian Loans (28.09.1956), the ICJ decided, on the basis of an
understanding between the parties, to join the preliminary objections to the merits (p. 74). Shortly
afterwards, in the case of the Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Judgment on Preliminary
Objections, of 26.11.1957), the ICJ pointed out that any evaluation of India’s fifth and sixth
preliminary objections would risk prejudging the merits; accordingly, it decided to join those
objections to the merits (pp. 150 and 152).


      15. Later on, in the case of Barcelona Traction (Judgment on Preliminary Objections,
of 24.07.1964), the Hague Court, recalling its case-law (PCIJ and ICJ) on the matter (pp. 41-42),
decided likewise to join Spain’s third and fourth preliminary objections to the merits (p. 46). In the
aftermath of its prolonged and cumbersome handling of the Barcelona Traction case (1964-1970),
the ICJ deemed it fit to introduce, in 1972, a change in the wording of the provision at issue of the
Rules of Court. The PCIJ Rules of Court (dating back to 1936) referred to the Court’s deciding on
the preliminary objection or joining it to the merits4. That provision survived in the ICJ Rules of
Court of 1946, and until the amendments introduced into the Rules in 1972 (cf. infra). The
provision then adopted in 1972 has been passed on to the Rules of Court of 1978 and 2000 (infra),
and remains the same to date.




             Paragraph 5 of Article 62 of the Rules of Court (of 1936) provided that:  “After hearing the Parties the

               “The present case is the first in which the Court has had occasion to exercise the
        power first provided for in the 1972 Rules of Court to declare that a preliminary
        objection ‘does not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an exclusively
        preliminary character’. It may therefore be appropriate to take this opportunity to
        comment briefly on the rationale of this provision of the Rules, in the light of the
        problems to which the handling of preliminary objections has given rise. In exercising
        its rule-making power under Article 30 of the Statute, and generally in approaching
        the complex issues which may be raised by the determination of appropriate
        procedures for the settlement of disputes, the Court has kept in view an approach
        defined by the [PCIJ]. That Court found that it was at liberty to adopt

                ‘the principle which it considers best calculated to ensure the
                administration of justice, most suited to procedure before an international
                tribunal and most in conformity with the fundamental principles of
                international law’ (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions [case], P.C.I.J.,
                [Judgment of 30.08.1924,] p. 16).

               Under the Rules of Court dating back to 1936 (which on this point reflected still
        earlier practice), the Court had the power to join an objection to the merits ‘whenever
        the interests of the good administration of justice require it’ (Panevezys-Saldutiskis
        Railway [case, Order of 30.06.1938, p. 56]), and in particular where the Court, if it
        were to decide on the objection, ‘would run the risk of adjudicating on questions
        which appertain to the merits of the case or of prejudging their solution’ (ibid.). If this
        power was exercised, there was always a risk, namely that the Court would ultimately
        decide the case on the preliminary objection, after requiring the parties fully to plead
        the merits,  and this did in fact occur ([in the] Barcelona Traction [case, Judgment
        of 1970, p. 3]). The result was regarded in some quarters as an unnecessary
        prolongation of an expensive and time-consuming procedure.




           Paragraph 7 of Article 69 of the Rules of Court (of 1972) provided that:  “After hearing the parties, the
Court shall give its decision in the form of a judgment, but which it shall either uphold the objection, reject it, or declare
that the objection does not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an exclusively preliminary character. If the Court
rejects the objection or declares that it does not possess an exclusively preliminary character, it shall fix time-limits for
the further proceedings”.
            Paragraph 7 of Article 79 of the Rules of Court (of 1978) had exactly the same content and phraseology of
Article 69 (7) of the previous Rules of Court (of 1972).
          Paragraph 9 of Article 79 of the current Rules of Court (of 2000) has likewise the same content and
phraseology of Article 79 (7) of the previous Rules of Court (of 1978).

                                                              -6-

              Taking into account the wide range of issues which might be presented as
       preliminary objections, the question which the Court faced was whether to revise the
       Rules so as to exclude for the future the possibility of joinder to the merits, so that
       every objection would have to be resolved at the preliminary stage, or to seek a
       solution which would be more flexible. The solution of considering all preliminary
       objections immediately and rejecting all possibility of a joinder to the merits had many
       advocates and presented many advantages. (...) However, that does not solve all
       questions of preliminary objections, which may, as experience has shown, be to some
       extent bound up with the merits. The final solution adopted in 1972, and maintained
       in the 1978 Rules, concerning preliminary objections is the following: the Court is to
       give its decision

                 ‘by which it shall either uphold the objection, reject it, or declare that the
                 objection does not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an
                 exclusively preliminary character. If the Court rejects the objection, or
                 declares that it does not possess an exclusively preliminary character, it
                 shall fix time-limits for the further proceedings’ (Art. 79, para. 7).

              (...) The new rule (...) thus presents one clear advantage: that it qualifies certain
       objections as preliminary, making it quite clear that when they are exclusively of that
       character they will have to be decided upon immediately, but if they are not, especially
       when the character of the objections is not exclusively preliminary because they
       contain both preliminary aspects and other aspects relating to the merits, they will
       have to be dealt with at the stage of the merits. This approach also tends to discourage
       the unnecessary prolongation of proceedings at the jurisdictional stage” (paras. 38-41).


       18. In this respect, at the time of change in 1972 of the Rules of Court, a former
Latin American Judge of the ICJ observed that, in face of the provision in Article 62 (5) of the
1946 Rules of Court as to the possible joinder of a preliminary objection to the merits, the ICJ was
worried with procedural delays, with “duplication of work” and “repetition of arguments”8. Hence
the amendments introduced the new provision of the Rules of Court, deleting the express reference
to the joinder, so as “to provide greater flexibility” and to avoid procedural delays, in sum, to
achieve a more orderly and expeditious and “a less onerous administration of international
justice”9.


       19. From the Court’s decision in the Nicaragua versus United States case (1984-1986,
supra) onwards, the ICJ has pursued this new outlook to the point at issue in its case-law. The
Court has thus moved on to further proceedings (on the merits) when the objections lodged before
it do not show to have a “preliminary” character. Thus, in its two Judgments on Preliminary
Objections (of 27.02.1998) in the Lockerbie cases, the Court saw it fit again to explain the changes
effected (in 1972) in its Rules of Court (the new Article 79). Article 79 (9) of the current Rules of
Court is clear, in that, if an objection seems to touch on the merits of the case, the Court may
declare that it does not possess an “exclusively preliminary character”, and move on to further
proceedings (on the merits). This amounted to a new outlook of what was earlier referred to10 as
joining the preliminary objection to the merits. In the Lockerbie cases, the Court pondered that




         E. Jiménez de Aréchaga, “The Amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the International Court of Justice”,
67 American Journal of International Law (1973) pp. 11 and 13.
          Ibid., pp. 21-22.
             Article 62 (5) of the previous Rules of Court.

                                                          -7-

             “The solution adopted in 1972 was ultimately not to exclude the power to
       examine a preliminary objection in the merits phase, but to limit the exercise of that
       power, by laying down the conditions more strictly” (paras. 48 and 49, respectively, of
       the two Judgments of 27.02.1998).


      20. This new outlook,  the ICJ proceeded,  presented the “clear advantage” of, once
finding that the character of the objections at issue was “not exclusively preliminary”, discouraging
the “unnecessary prolongation of proceedings at the jurisdictional stage”. The ICJ then found, in
the Lockerbie cases, that the respective objections of the United States and the United Kingdom did
not have “an exclusively preliminary character” within the meaning of Article 79 of the Rules, and
could only be considered when the Court reached the merits of the case (paras. 50 and 51,
respectively, of the two Judgments of 27.02.1998).


      21. In the same line of thinking, shortly afterwards, in the case of the Land and Maritime
Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Judgment on Preliminary Objections, of 11.06.1998),
the ICJ found that it could not give a decision on Nigeria’s eighth preliminary objection “as a
preliminary matter”, and that it had “of necessity (...) to deal with the merits of Cameroon’s
request” (para. 116). The Court concluded and declared that the eighth preliminary objection did
not have, in the circumstances of the case, “an exclusively preliminary character” (paras. 117-118).


       22. One decade later, in its Judgment on Preliminary Objections (of 18.11.2008) in the case
of the Application of the Convention against Genocide (Croatia versus Serbia), the ICJ, found that
Serbia’s second preliminary objection did not possess, in the circumstances of the case, “an
exclusively preliminary character” (paras. 130 and 146). Very recently, in its Judgment
of 03.02.2015, the ICJ at last delivered its Judgment on the merits of that case. We are here in a
domain wherein general principles of law play an important role, whether they are substantive
principles (such as those of pacta sunt servanda, or of bona fides), or procedural principles, to
which I turn attention now.


                    IV. RELEVANCE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL
                                      PROCEDURAL LAW

                               1. General Principles and the Foundations of
                                      the International Legal Order

       23. In my perception, recourse to general principles of international procedural law is in
effect ineluctable, in the realization of justice. General principles are always present and relevant,
at substantive and procedural levels. Such principles orient the interpretation and application of
legal norms. They rest on the foundations of any legal system, which is made to operate on the
basis of fundamental principles. Ultimately, without principles there is truly no legal system.
Fundamental principles form the substratum of the legal order itself11.


      24. May it here be recalled that, in another case, like the present one, opposing two other
Latin American States (Argentina and Uruguay), the case concerning Pulp Mills on the River
Uruguay (Judgment of 20.04.2010), I deemed it fit to call the Court’s attention, in my Separate
Opinion, to the fact that both contending parties, Argentina and Uruguay, had expressly invoked

general principles of law in the course of the contentious proceedings (para. 46). In doing so, I

       25. The ICJ has remained attentive to general principles (cf. supra) in the exercise of the
international judicial function. As master of its procedure, as well as of its jurisdiction, the Court is
fully entitled to determine freely the order in which it will resolve the issues raised by the
contending parties. And, in doing so, it is not limited by the arguments raised by the contending
parties, as indicated by the principle jura novit curia. The Court knows the Law, and, in settling
disputes, attentive to the equality of parties, it also says what the Law is (juris dictio, jus dicere).


                     2. General Principles in Distinct Incidental Proceedings

       26. Along the years, as one would expect, the principle of the sound administration of justice
(la bonne administration de la justice) has been resorted to in respect of distinct kinds of incidental
proceedings (Rules of Court, Articles 73-86), namely, preliminary objections, provisional
measures of protection, counter-claims and intervention. The aforementioned principle has marked
its presence, as already seen in the present Separate Opinion, in the handling of the incidental
proceedings of preliminary objections (cf. supra). Recourse has likewise been made to that
principle, in recent years, in the other incidental proceedings of provisional measures,
counter-claims and intervention. May I briefly refer to its incidence, as I perceive it, in these other
incidental proceedings.


       27. In so far as provisional measures of protection are concerned, in my Dissenting Opinion
in the case of Questions Relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or to Extradite (Belgium versus
Senegal, Order of 28.05.2009), I deemed it fit to recall that, in its case-law, the ICJ has ordered
provisional measures so as to contribute “to secure la bonne administration de la justice”
(para. 28). I pondered that “in the case-law itself of the ICJ there are already elements disclosing
the concern of the Court, when issuing Orders of provisional measures, to strive towards achieving
a good administration of justice” (para. 29). I further warned that, in the consideration of the cas
d’espèce, the Court should keep in mind that “the right to the realization of justice assumes a
central place, and a paramount importance, and becomes thus deserving of particular attention”
(para. 29).


       28. As to counter-claims, in my Dissenting Opinion in the case of Jurisdictional Immunities
of the State (Germany versus Italy, Order of 06.07.2010), I felt obliged to stress that

      “(...) Without Italy’s counter claim of reparations for damages arising of war crimes,
      the Court will now have a much narrower horizon to pronounce on Germany’s
      (original) claim of State immunity. The present decision of the Court made tabula
      rasa of its own previous reasonings, and of 70 years of the more enlightened legal
      doctrine on the matter, to the effect that counter-claims do assist in achieving the
      sound administration of justice (la bonne administration de la justice) and in securing
      the needed equilibrium between the procedural rights of the contending parties.

             In any case, as the Court’s majority decided summarily to discard the
      counter-claim as ‘inadmissible as such’,  with my firm dissent,  it should at least
      have instructed itself properly by holding, first, public hearings to obtain further
      clarifications from the contending parties. It should not have taken the present
      decision without first having heard the contending parties in a public sitting, for five
      reasons, namely: a) first, as a basic requirement ensuing from the principle of
      international procedural law of the sound administration of justice (la bonne
      administration de la justice); b) secondly, because counter-claims are ontologically
      endowed with autonomy, and ought to be treated on the same footing as the original
      claims, that they intend to neutralize (supra); c) thirdly, claims and counter-claims,

      with by the Court in the way it did, summarily rejecting the counter-claim”
      (paras. 29-30).


      29. And in so far as intervention is concerned, again in the case in the case of Jurisdictional
Immunities of the State (Germany versus Italy, intervention of Greece, Order of 04.07.2011), I

       54. The Pact of Bogotá served as basis of the ICJ’s jurisdiction in the case of the
1906 Arbitral Award by the King of Spain (Honduras versus Nicaragua, 1960), — but ever since,
until the mid-eighties, the Pact laid dormant, in so far as the ICJ jurisdiction is concerned.
Furthermore, the Pact of Bogotá, despite its few ratifications (only [fourteen])49, was to be
considered in the context of regional arrangements for conflict resolution in Latin America, given
the importance ascribed by Latin American States to the general principle of peaceful settlement of
international disputes50.


       55. After the aforementioned dismissed initiatives as to its eventual amendment (supra),
there occurred, from the late eighties onwards, a gradual revival of the Pact of Bogotá, as basis of
the ICJ’s jurisdiction, in disputes — like the one in the present case — opposing Latin American
States. Reference can be made to the Court’s Judgments in the cases, e.g., of Border and
Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua versus Honduras, 1988), Territorial and Maritime Dispute
between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (2007), Dispute regarding Navigational
and Related Rights (Costa Rica versus Nicaragua, 2009), Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay
(Argentina versus Uruguay, 2010), Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua versus Colombia,
2013), Maritime Dispute (Peru versus Chile, 2014). To these, one may add five other cases,

currently pending before the Court51. Yet, despite this recent revival of the Pact of Bogotá, I
suppose no one would dare to predict, or to hazard a guess, as to further developments in its
application in the future. After all, despite advances made, experience shows, within a larger
context, that the parcours towards compulsory jurisdiction is a particularly long one, there still
remains a long path to follow52...


       56. It should not pass unnoticed that, significantly, the legacy of Latin American doctrine
(supra) as to the enhancement of judicial settlement of international disputes was well captured and
sustained by the ICJ, e.g., in its Judgment of 20.12.1988 in the case concerning Border and
Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua versus Honduras). The ICJ held therein that Article XXXI
of the Pact of Bogotá enshrines an engagement which can in no way be amended by a subsequent
unilateral declaration. In the words of the Court itself, whenever such declaration is made, “it has
no effect on the commitment” resulting from Article XXXI of the Pact (para. 36). The States
Parties to the Pact have not linked together Article XXXI and such declarations (para. 40); that
commitment “is independent of such declarations” (para. 41).


       57. In sum, the Court’s jurisdiction is grounded on the provision of a treaty (the Pact of
Bogotá), and not on a unilateral declaration, as under the optional clause of Article 36 (2) of the ICJ
Statute. Article XXXI was intended to enhance the jurisdiction of the Court, ratione materiae and
ratione temporis (not admitting subsequent restrictions, while the Pact remains in force), as well as
ratione personae (concerning all States Parties to the Pact). In my own perception, the traditional
voluntarist conception (a derivative of anachronical legal positivism) yielded to the reassuring
conception of the jus necessarium, to the benefit of the realization of international justice.


       58. It was made clear by the ICJ, already in the case of Border and Transborder Armed
Actions, that Article XXXI amounts to a compromissory clause which sets forth the engagement,
by the States Parties to the Pact, as to the conventional basis of the jurisdiction of the ICJ, to settle
all “disputes of a juridical nature”, independently of the optional clause (Article 36 (2) of the ICJ
Statute). The Court stressed that it was “quite clear from the Pact that the purpose of the American
States in drafting it was to reinforce their mutual commitments with regard to the judicial
settlement. This is also confirmed by the travaux préparatoires” of the Pact, during which the
judicial procedure before the ICJ was regarded as “the principal procedure for the peaceful
settlement of conflicts between the American States” (para. 46). Furthermore, expert writing has
likewise acknowledged that Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá enhanced the procedure of judicial
settlement by the ICJ53.

       59. May I come to the remaining aspect that I purport to address in the present Separate
Opinion. In its Judgment of today, 24.09.2015, in the case concerning the Obligation to Negotiate
Access to the Pacific Ocean, the Court — as I have already pointed out (cf. paras. 2-3, supra) —
has very briefly referred to Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá and to Article 79 (9) of the Rules of
Court, in comparison with the attention it devoted to Article VI of the Pact. May it here be recalled
that, in the case of Nicaragua versus United States (merits, Judgment of 27.06.1986), the ICJ
elaborated on the scope of Article 79 of the Rules of Court, to the effect that the provision

      “presents one clear advantage: that it qualifies certain objections as preliminary,
      making it quite clear that when they are exclusively of that character they will have to
      be decided upon immediately, but if they are not, especially when the character of the
      objections is not exclusively preliminary because they contain both preliminary
      aspects and other aspects relating to the merits, they will have to be dealt with at the
      stage of the merits. This approach also tends to discourage the unnecessary
      prolongation of proceedings at the jurisdictional stage” (para. 41).


      60. This point was later reiterated by the ICJ in the Lockerbie cases (preliminary objections,
Libya versus United Kingdom and United States, Judgments of 27.02.1998, paras. 49 and 48,
respectively). Moreover, in the aforementioned case of Territorial and Maritime Dispute
(Nicaragua versus Colombia, preliminary objections, Judgment of 13.12.2007), it was also clarified
by the Court that, in principle, a party raising a preliminary objection (to jurisdiction or
admissibility) is entitled to have that objection answered at the preliminary stage of the proceedings
unless the Court “does not have before it all facts necessary” to decide the question raised, or else
the Court, in answering that objection, would prejudge the dispute, or some elements thereof, on
the merits (para. 51).


       61. Article 79 (9) of the Rules of Court is not limited to the ICJ deciding in one way or
another (upholding or rejecting) the objection raised before it in the course of the proceedings.
Article 79 (9) in effect contemplates a third way (troisième voie/tercera vía), namely, in its terms:

      “declare that the objection does not possess, in the circumstances of the case, an
      exclusively preliminary character. If the Court rejects the objection or declares that it
      does not possess an exclusively preliminary character, it shall fix time-limits for the
      further proceedings”.


       62. This being so, the ICJ, moving into the merits, asserts its jurisdiction; this happens
because the character of the objection contains aspects relating to the merits, and thus requires an
examination of the merits. This is so in the present case concerning the Obligation to Negotiate
Access to the Pacific Ocean, as to the dispute arisen between Bolivia and Chile, as to whether their
practice subsequent to the 1904 Peace Treaty substantiates an obligation to negotiate on the part of
the respondent State. Such negotiations have given rise to a dispute, not settled by the 1904 Peace
Treaty. Chile’s objection cannot be properly decided without deciding the merits of the dispute, as
it does not have an exclusively preliminary character, appearing rather as a defence as to the merits
of Bolivia’s claim.

                                                 - 21 -


       63. There have been negotiations, extending well after the adoption of the 1948 Pact of
Bogotá, in which both contending parties were actively engaged; although in the present Judgment
there is no express reference to any of such negotiations specifically, the ICJ takes note of
arguments made in the course of the proceedings of the cas d’espèce to the effect that negotiations
took place subsequently to the 1904 Peace Treaty (para. 19)54 on unsettled issues, well beyond the
date of the adoption of the Pact of Bogotá (on 30.04.1948), until 2012. The present case relating to
the Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean concerns such process of negotiations, and
the issue whether there is a duty to pursue them further.


       64. To assert the duty to negotiate is not the same as to assert the duty to negotiate an
agreement, or a given result. The former does not imply the latter. This is a matter for
consideration at the merits stage. The Court is here concerned only with the former, the claimed
duty to negotiate. The objection raised by the respondent State does not appear as one of an
exclusively preliminary character. The substance of it can only be properly addressed in the course
of the consideration of the merits of the cas d’espèce, not as a “preliminary objection”. The Court
is thus right in proceeding — for this particular reason — to fix time-limits for further proceedings
(Article 79 (9) in fine), moving into the merits phase. The contending parties’ post-1904 exchanges
and declarations appear to substantiate an obligation to negotiate, beyond and irrespective of the
1904 Peace Treaty. The Court has thus to move into the merits, in order to examine, and
pronounce upon, the punctum pruriens of the cas d’espèce.


       65. May it here be further pointed out that, in the case of the Territorial and Maritime
Dispute (Nicaragua versus Colombia, preliminary objections, Judgment of 13.12.2007), the ICJ,
after recalling the rationale of Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá, found that the dispute had not been
settled by the treaty at issue (of 1938, and Protocol of 1930), nor by a judicial decision, and thus
found it had jurisdiction under Article XXXI of the Pact (paras. 77 and 120). The ICJ deemed it fit
further to recall that Article 79 (9) of its Rules of Court establishes three ways in which it may
dispose of a preliminary objection: either to uphold or to reject it, or else to declare that it does not
possess an exclusively preliminary character (para. 48).


       66. This would have been, in my perception, the proper and more prudent way for the Court
to dispose of the preliminary objection raised by Chile in the present case opposing it to Bolivia. In
any case, the ICJ would move into the merits. The first and third ways foreseen by Article 79 (9)
of the Rules of Court lead, on the basis of distinct reasonings, to a consideration of the merits of the
case. In the previous case of the Territorial and Maritime Dispute, opposing Nicaragua to
Colombia (supra), the ICJ further stressed that the commitment under Article XXXI of the Pact of
Bogotá is an “autonomous one” (independent from an optional clause declaration), which enhances
the access to the Court (paras. 134-135) and the judicial settlement of “disputes of a juridical
nature” under the Pact of Bogotá. Article XXXI cannot be unduly limited by optional clause
declarations, nor by preliminary objections which do not possess an exclusively preliminary
character.


       67. May I conclude that the objection raised by Chile appears as a defence to Bolivia’s claim
as to the merits, inextricably interwoven with this latter. And the Court, anyway, does not count on
all the necessary information to render a decision on it as a “preliminary” issue. It is, in my view,
more in line with the good administration of justice (la bonne administration de la justice) that the
Court should keep the issue to be resolved at the merits stage, when the contending parties will
have had the opportunity to plead their case in full. This would entail no delays at all for the
