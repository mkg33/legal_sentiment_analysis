and interests in Switzerland; the question of the Swiss or German
character of Interhandel was the subject of investigations and
exchanges of views for the purpose of reaching a decision as to the
fate of the assets in Switzerland of that company. It was only after
the decision of the Swiss Authority of Review of January 5th, 1048,
definitely recognizing the non-enemy character of the assets of Inter-
handel and, in consequence, putting an end to the provisional
blocking of these assets in Switzerland, had, in the opinion of the
Federal Government, acquired the authority of res judicata, that that
Government for the first time addressed to the United States its
claim for the restitution of Interhandel’s assets in the United States.

The discussions regarding Interhandel between the Swiss and
American authorities in 1945, 1946 and 1947 took place within the
framework of the collaboration established between them prior to
the Washington Accord and defined in that Accord. The represen-
tatives of the Joint Commission and those of the Swiss Compensation
Office communicated to each other the results of their enquiries
and investigations, and discussed their opinions with regard to
Interhandel, without arriving at any final conclusions. Thus, for
instance, the minute of the meeting of the Joint Commission on
September 8th, 1947, records:

“The representatives of the Swiss Compensation Office stated
that their investigations had yielded only negative results and



that they were still waiting for the Allies to furnish their documents
which the Swiss Compensation Office was ready to discuss with
the Allied experts.”

The Court cannot see in these discussions between the Allied and
Swiss officials a dispute between Governments which had already
arisen with regard to the restitution of the assets claimed by Inter-
handel in the United States; the facts and situations which have
led to a dispute must not be confused with the dispute itself; the
documents relating to this collaboration between the Allied and
Swiss authorities for the purpose of liquidating German property
in Switzerland are not relevant to the solution of the question
raised by the first objection of the United States.

The First Preliminary Objection must therefore be rejected so
far as the principal submission of Switzerland is concerned.

In the Alternative Submission, Switzerland asks the Court to
adjudge and declare that the United States is under an obligation
to submit the dispute to arbitration or conciliation.

In raising its objection ratione temporis to the Application of the
Swiss Government, the Government of the United States has not
distinguished between the principal claim and the alternative claim
in the Application. It is, however, clear that the alternative claim,
in spite of its close connection with the principal claim, is never-
theless a separate and distinct claim relating not to the substance
of the dispute, but to the procedure for its settlement.

The point here in dispute is the obligation of the Government
of the United States to submit to arbitration or to conciliation an
obligation the existence of which is asserted by Switzerland and
denied by the United States. This part of the dispute can only have
arisen subsequently to that relating to the restitution of Inter-
handel’s assets in the United States, since the procedure proposed
by Switzerland and rejected by the United States was conceived
as a means of settling the first dispute. In fact, the Swiss Govern-
ment put forward this proposal for the first time in its Note of
August gth, 1956, and the Government of the United States reject-
ed it by its Note of January 11th, 1957.

With regard to the Alternative Submission of Switzerland, the
First Preliminary Objection cannot therefore be upheld.

Second Preliminary Objection

According to this Objection, the present dispute, even if it is
subsequent to the date of the Declaration of the United States,
arose before July 28th, 1948, the date of the entry into force of
the Swiss Declaration. The argument set out in the Preliminary
Objections is as follows:



“The United States Declaration, which was effective August 26th,
1946, contained the clause limiting the Court’s jurisdiction to
disputes ‘hereafter arising’, while no such qualifying clause is
contained in the Swiss Declaration which was effective July 28th,
1948. But the reciprocity principle ... requires that as between
the United States and Switzerland the Court’s jurisdiction be
limited to disputes arising after July 28th, 1948... Otherwise,
retroactive effect would be given to the compulsory jurisdiction
of the Court.”

In particular, it was contended with regard to disputes arising
after August 26th, 1946, but before July 28th, 1948, that “Switzer-
land, as a Respondent, could have invoked the principle of reci-
procity and claimed that, in the same way as the United States is
not bound to accept the Court’s jurisdiction with respect to disputes
arising before its acceptance, Switzerland, too, could not be re-
quired to accept the Court’s jurisdiction in relation to disputes
arising before its acceptance.”

Reciprocity in the case of Declarations accepting the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court enables a Party to invoke a reservation to
that acceptance which it has not expressed in its own Declaration
but which the other Party has expressed in its Declaration. For
example, Switzerland, which has not expressed in its Declaration
any reservation ratione temporis, while the United States has accept-
ed the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court only in respect of
disputes subsequent to August 26th, 1946, might, if in the position
of Respondent, invoke by virtue of reciprocity against the United
States the American reservation if the United States attempted to
refer to the Court a dispute with Switzerland which had arisen
before August 26th, 1946. This is the effect of reciprocity in this
connection. Reciprocity enables the State which has made the
wider acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court to rely upon the
reservations to the acceptance laid down by the other Party. There
the effect of reciprocity ends. It cannot justify a State, in this
instance, the United States, in relying upon a restriction which the
other Party, Switzerland, has not included in its own Declaration.

The Second Preliminary Objection must therefore be rejected
so far as the Principal Submission of Switzerland is concerned.

Since it has already been found that the dispute concerning the
obligation of the United States to agree to arbitration or conciliation
did not arise until 1957, the Second Preliminary Objection must
also be rejected so far as the Alternative Submission of Switzerland

1s concerned.

Fourth Preliminary Objection

Since the Fourth Preliminary Objection of the United States
relates to the jurisdiction of the Court in the present case, the
Court will proceed to consider it before the Third Objection which



is an objection to admissibility. This Fourth Objection really
consists of two objections which are of different character and of
unequal scope. The Court will deal in the first place with part (5)
of this Objection.

The Government of the United States submits “that there is no
jurisdiction in this Court to hear or determine any issues raised
by the Swiss Application or Memorial concerning the seizure and
retention of the vested shares of General Aniline and Film Cor-
poration, for the reason that such seizure and retention are,
according to international law, matters within the domestic juris-
diction of the United States”.

In challenging before the Court the seizure and retention of these
shares by the authorities of the United States, the Swiss Govern-
ment invokes the Washington Accord and general international law.

In order to determine whether the examination of the grounds
thus invoked is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court for the
reason alleged by the United States, the Court will base itself on
the course followed by the Permanent Court of International
Justice in its Advisory Opinion concerning Nationality Decrees
issued in Tunis and Morocco (Series B, No. 4), when dealing with
a similar divergence of view. Accordingly, the Court does not, at
the present stage of the proceedings, intend to assess the validity
of the grounds invoked by the Swiss Government or to give an
opinion on their interpretation, since that would be to enter upon
the merits of the dispute. The Court will confine itself to considering
whether the grounds invoked by the Swiss Government are such
as to justify the provisional conclusion that they may be of relevance
in this case and, if so, whether questions relating to the validity and
interpretation of those grounds are questions of international law.

With regard to its principal Submission that the Government of
the United States is under an obligation to restore the assets of
Interhandel in the United States, the Swiss Government invokes
Article IV of the Washington Accord. The Government of the
United States contends that this Accord relates only to German
property in Switzerland, and that Article IV “is of no relevance
whatever in the present dispute”.

By Article IV of this international agreement, the United States
has assumed the obligation to unblock Swiss assets in the United
States. The Parties are in disagreement with regard to the meaning
of the term “unblock” and the term “Swiss assets”. The inter-
pretation of these terms is a question of international law which
affects the merits of the dispute. At the present stage of the pro-
ceedings it is sufficient for the Court to note that Article IV of the
Washington Accord may be of relevance for the solution of the
present dispute and that its interpretation relates to international
law.

The Government of the United States submits that according
to international law the seizure and retention of enemy property



in time of war are matters within the domestic jurisdiction of the
United States and are not subject to any international supervision.
All the authorities and judicial decisions cited by the United States
refer to enemy property; but the whole question is whether the
assets of Interhandel are enemy or neutral property. There having
been a formal challenge based on principles of international law
by a neutral State which has adopted the cause of its national, it is
not open to the United States to say that their decision is final and
not open to challenge; despite the American character of the
Company, the shares of which are held by Interhandel, this is a
matter which must be decided in the light of the principles and rules
of international law governing the relations between belligerents
and neutrals in time of war.

In its alternative Submission, the Swiss Government requests
the Court to adjudge and declare that the United States is under
an obligation to submit the dispute to arbitration or conciliation.
The Swiss Government invokes Article VI of the Washington
Accord, which provides: “In case differences of opinion arise with
regard to the application or interpretation of this Accord which
cannot be settled in any other way, recourse shall be had to arbi-
tration.” It also invokes the Treaty of Arbitration and Conciliation
between Switzerland and the United States, dated February 16th,
1931. Article I of this Treaty provides: “Every dispute arising
between the Contracting Parties, of whatever nature it may be,
shall, when ordinary diplomatic proceedings have failed, be sub-
mitted to arbitration or to conciliation, as the Contracting Parties
may at the time decide.” The interpretation and application of
these provisions relating to arbitration and conciliation involve
questions of international law.

Part (b) of the Fourth Preliminary Objection must therefore be
rejected.

Part (a) of the Fourth Objection seeks a finding from the Court
that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the Application of the
Swiss Government, for the reason that the sale or disposition by the
Government of the United States of the shares of the GAF which
have been vested as enemy property “has been determined by the
United States of America, pursuant to paragraph (b) of the Con-
ditions attached to this country’s acceptance of this Court’s juris-
diction, to be a matter essentially within the domestic jurisdiction
of this country". The Preliminary Objections state that: “Such
declination encompasses all issues raised in the Swiss Application
and Memorial (including issues raised by the Swiss-United States
Treaty of 1931 and the Washington Accord of 1946)”, but they
add: “in so far as the determination of the issues would affect the
sale or disposition of the shares”. And they immediately go on to
say: “However, the determination pursuant to paragraph (5) of the
Conditions attached to this country’s acceptance of the Court's



compulsory jurisdiction is made only as regards the sale or dis-
position of the assets.”

During the oral arguments, the Agent for the United States
continued to maintain that the scope of part (a) of the Fourth
Objection was limited to the sale and disposition of the shares.
At the same time, while insisting that local remedies were once
more available to Interhandel and that, pending the final decision
of the Courts of the United States, the disputed shares could not
be sold, he declared on several occasions that part (a) of the Fourth
Objection has lost practical significance, that “it has become
somewhat academic’’, and that it is “somewhat moot”.

Although the Agent for the United States maintained the Objec-
tion throughout the oral arguments, it appears to the Court that,
thus presented, part (a) of the Fourth Objection only applies to
the claim of the Swiss Government regarding the restitution of the
assets of Interhandel which have been vested in the United States.
Having regard to the decision of the Court set out below in respect
of the Third Preliminary Objection of the United States, it appears
to the Court that part (a) of the Fourth Preliminary Objection is
without object at the present stage of the proceedings.

Third Preliminary Objection

The Third Preliminary Objection seeks a finding that “there is
no jurisdiction in this Court to hear or determine the matters raised
by the Swiss Application and Memorial, for the reason that Inter-
handel, whose case Switzerland is espousing, has not exhausted the
local remedies available to it in the United States courts”.

Although framed as an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court,
this Objection must be regarded as directed against the admissibility
of the Application of the Swiss Government. Indeed, by its nature
it is to be regarded as a plea which would become devoid of object
if the requirement of the prior exhaustion of local remedies were
fulfilled.

The Court has indicated in what conditions the Swiss Government,
basing itself on the idea that Interhandel’s suit had been finally
rejected in the United States courts, considered itself entitled to
institute proceedings by its Application of October 2nd, 1957.
However, the decision given by the Supreme Court of the United
States on October 14th, 1957, on the application of Interhandel
made on August 6th, 1957, granted a writ of certiorari and re-
admitted Interhandel into the suit. The judgment of that Court on
June 16th, 1958, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals
dismissing Interhandel’s suit and remanded the case to the District



Court. It was thenceforth open to Interhandel to avail itself again
of the remedies available to it under the Trading with the Enemy
Act, and to seek the restitution of its shares by proceedings in the
United States courts. Its suit is still pending in the United States
courts. The Court must have regard to the situation thus created.

The rule that local remedies must be exhausted before inter-
national proceedings may be instituted is a well-established rule
of customary international law; the rule has been generally observed
in cases in which a State has adopted the cause of its national whose
rights are claimed to have been disregarded in another State in
violation of international law. Before resort may be had to an
international court in such a situation, it has been considered
necessary that the State where the violation occurred should have
an opportunity to redress it by its own means, within the framework
of its own domestic legal system. À fortiori the rule must be observed
when domestic proceedings are pending, as in the case of Inter-
handel, and when the two actions, that of the Swiss company in
the United States courts and that of the Swiss Government in
this Court, in its principal Submission, are designed to obtain the
same result: the restitution of the assets of Interhandel vested in
the United States.

The Swiss Government does not challenge the rule which requires
that international judicial proceedings may only be instituted
following the exhaustion of local remedies, but contends that the
present case is one in which an exception to this rule is authorized
by the rule itself.

The Court does not consider it necessary to dwell upon the
assertion of the Swiss Government that “the United States itself
has admitted that Interhandel had exhausted the remedies available
in the United States courts”. It is true that the representatives of
the Government of the United States expressed this opinion on
several occasions, in particular in the memorandum annexed to the
Note of the Secretary of State of January r1th, 1957. This opinion
was based upon a view which has proved unfounded. In fact, the
proceedings which Interhandel had instituted before the courts of
the United States were then in progress.

However, the Swiss Government has raised against the Third
Objection other considerations which require examination.

In the first place, it is contended that the rule is not applicable
for the reason that the measure taken against Interhandel and
regarded as contrary to international law is a measure which was
taken, not by a subordinate authority but by the Government of
the United States. However, the Court must attach decisive
importance to the fact that the laws of the United States make
available to interested persons who consider that they have been
deprived of their rights by measures taken in pursuance of the
Trading with the Enemy Act, adequate remedies for the defence
of their rights against the Executive.



It has also been contended on behalf of the Swiss Government
that in the proceedings based upon the Trading with the Enemy
Act, the United States courts are not in a position to adjudicate
in accordance with the rules of international law and that the
Supreme Court, in its decision of June 16th, 1958, made no reference
to the many questions of international law which, in the opinion
of the Swiss Government, constitute the subject of the present
dispute. But the decisions of the United States courts bear witness
to the fact that United States courts are competent to apply
international law in their decisions when necessary. In the present
case, when the dispute was brought to this Court, the proceedings
in the United States courts had not reached the merits, in which
considerations of international law could have been profitably
relied upon.

The Parties have argued the question of the binding force before
the courts of the United States of international instruments which,
according to the practice of the United States, fall within the
category of Executive Agreements; the Washington Accord is said
to belong to that category. At the present stage of the proceedings
it is not necessary for the Court to express an opinion on the matter.
Neither is it practicable, before the final decision of the domestic
courts, to anticipate what basis they may adopt for their judgment.

Finally, the Swiss Government laid special stress on the argument
that the character of the principal Submission of Switzerland is
that of a claim for the implementation of the decision given on
January 5th, 1948, by the Swiss Authority of Review and based
on the Washington Accord, a decision which the Swiss Government
regards as an international judicial decision. “When an international
decision has not been executed, there are no local remedies to
exhaust, for the injury has been caused directly to the injured
State.” It has therefore contended that the failure by the United
States to implement the decision constitutes a direct breach of
international law, causing immediate injury to the rights of Switzer-
land as the Applicant State. The Court notes in the first place that
to implement a decision is to apply its operative part. In the opera-
tive part of its decision, however, the Swiss Authority of Review
“Decrees: (1) that the Appeal is sustained and the decision sub-
jecting the appellant to the blocking of German property in Switzer-
land is annulled...” The decision of the Swiss Authority of
Review relates to the unblocking of the assets of Interhandel in
Switzerland; the Swiss claim is designed to secure the restitution
of the assets of Interhandel in the United States. Without prejudg-
ing the validity of any arguments which the Swiss Government
seeks or may seek to base upon that decision, the Court would
confine itself to observing that such arguments do not deprive the
dispute which has been referred to it of the character of a dispute
in which the Swiss Government appears as having adopted the
cause of its national, Interhandel, for the purpose of securing the



restitution to that company of assets vested by the Government of
the United States. This is one of the very cases which give rise to
the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies.

For all these reasons, the Court upholds the Third Preliminary
Objection so far as the principal Submission of Switzerland is
concerned.

In its alternative claim, the Swiss Government asks the Court to
declare its competence to decide whether the United States is under
an obligation to submit the dispute to arbitration or conciliation.
The Government of the United States contends that this claim,
while not identical with the principal claim, is designed to secure
the same object, namely, the restitution of the assets of Interhandel
in the United States, and that for this reason the Third Objection
applies equally to it. It maintains that the rule of the exhaustion
of local remedies applies to each of the principal and alternative
Submissions which seek “a ruling by this Court to the effect that
some other international tribunal now has jurisdiction to determine
that very same issue, even though that issue is at the same time
being actively litigated in the United States courts”.

The Court considers that one interest, and one alone, that of
Interhandel, which has led the latter to institute and to resume
proceedings before the United States courts, has induced the Swiss
Government to institute international proceedings. This interest is
the basis for the present claim and should determine the scope of the
action brought before the Court by the Swiss Government in its
alternative form as well as in its principal form. On the other hand,
the grounds on which the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies
is based are the same, whether in the case of an international court,
arbitral tribunal, or conciliation commission. In these circumstances,
the Court considers that any distinction so far as the rule of the
exhaustion of local remedies is concerned between the various
claims or between the various tribunals is unfounded.

It accordingly upholds the Third Preliminary Objection also as
regards the alternative Submission of Switzerland.

For these reasons,


by ten votes to five,
rejects the First Preliminary Objection of the Government of the
United States of America ;

unanimously,
rejects the Second Preliminary Objection ;

by ten votes to five,
finds that it is not necessary to adjudicate on part (a) of the Fourth
Preliminary Objection;



by fourteen votes to one,
rejects part (b) of the Fourth Preliminary Objection; and

by nine votes to six,
upholds the Third Preliminary Objection and holds that the
Application of the Government of the Swiss Confederation is
inadmissible.

Judge BASDEVANT states that he concurs in the decision that
the Application is inadmissible as that decision is set forth in the
operative part of the Judgment, but he adds that his opinion on
this point was reached in a way which, in certain respects, differs
from that followed by the Court. Basing himself on the provisions
of the Statute and of the Rules of Court, he considered that, in
order to assess the validity of the objections advanced, he should
direct his attention to the subject of the dispute and not to any
particular claim put forward in connection with the dispute. The
subject of the dispute and the subject of the claim are explicitly
differentiated in Article 32, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court.
Accordingly, he has directed his attention to the statement in the
Application to the effect that the latter submits to the Court the
dispute relating to “the restitution by the United States of the
assets” of Interhandel. This indication of the subject of the dispute,
which is confirmed by an examination of the correspondence,
reveals the scope of the dispute, shows that it is not limited to
whatever may have been discussed at any particular moment
between the two Governments and consequently throws a light
upon the date at which the dispute between them arose. He was
thus led to the conclusion that the dispute to which the Appli-
cation relates did not arise until after July 28th, 1948, and this
factual finding is sufficient to justify the rejection of the first
two preliminary objections.



In his view, the subject of the dispute justifies, in this case,
the requirement of the preliminary exhaustion of local remedies
on the ground that if, through them, Interhandel obtains satis-
faction, the subject of the dispute will disappear. He refrained
from complicating the problem by considering any particular
claim that might be put forward in connection with the dispute
indicated in the Application. In considering the question whether
in fact the local remedies have been exhausted, he based himself
largely on the factual data mentioned in the Judgment. He took
account also of certain other facts—the fact that, at the date of
the memorandum of January 11th, 1957, an appeal by Interhandel
was pending in the American courts, the mention by the Swiss
Co-Agent (at the hearing on October 12th, 1957) of the application
made to the Supreme Court, with the comment that that appli-
cation also would end in a negative decision and, finally, the mention
in the preamble of the Order of the Court of October 24th, 1957,
of a judicial proceeding then pending in the United States.

As the anticipated effect of a judgment on a preliminary ob-
jection is to determine whether the proceedings on the merits
will or will not be resumed, he might have agreed that the Court
should confine itself to adjudicating on the Third Objection
which it has upheld. As the Application .is declared to be
inadmissible, this puts an end to the proceedings and all the
other questions that were connected with them no longer arise.
He considered, nevertheless, that it was his duty to follow the
Court in the examination of the other points with which it dealt
and, on those points, he concurs in the operative part of the
Judgment.

Judge KoJevwixov states that he concurs in the Judgment of
the Court so far as the First, Second, Third and part (a) of the
Fourth Preliminary Objections of the Government of the United
States are concerned. He is, however, unable to concur in the
reasoning of the Judgment relating to the Second Preliminary
Objection since, in his opinion, the Judgment should have been
based not on the question of reciprocity, which is of very great
importance, but upon the factual circumstances which show that
the legal character of the dispute between the Swiss Government
and the Government of the United States was clearly defined only
after July 28th, 1948, the date of the entry into force of the Swiss
Declaration.

Judge Kojevnikov is further of the opinion that the Third
Objection should have been upheld by the Court, not only as a
contention relating to the admissibility of the Application, but also
with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court.

Finally, he considers that part (b) of the Fourth Preliminary
Objection, having regard to its subject-matter, ought not to have



been rejected but, in the present case, should have been joined
to the merits if the Court had not upheld the Third Objection.

M. Carry, Judge ad hoc, states that he regrets that he cannot
subscribe to the decisions taken by the Court on the Third and
part (a) of the Fourth Objections of the Government of the United
States. He agrees generally with the dissenting opinion of President
Klaestad.

He considers that in any event the Third Objection should not
have been upheld in so far as it was directed against the alternative
claim of the Swiss Government relating to arbitration or conciliation.
He regards that claim as separate and distinct from the principal
claim, since it did not relate to the merits of the dispute but only
to the procedure for its settlement. By this claim the Court was
invited to pass only upon the arbitrability of the dispute, not on
the obligation of the United States to return the assets of Inter-
handel. That latter question was within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the tribunal to be seised. It follows, in his opinion, that the rule
relating to the exhaustion of local remedies was not applicable to
the alternative claim of the Swiss Government, inasmuch as, by
that claim, the applicant State sought to secure from the inter-
national tribunal a result different from that which Interhandel is
seeking to obtain in the American courts. The question of exhaustion
of local remedies is one which could arise only before the arbitral
tribunal seised of the case: the Court should not, in his opinion,
encroach upon the jurisdiction of that tribunal.

Judges HACKWORTH, CORDOVA, WELLINGTON Koo0 and Sir Percy
SPENDER, availing themselves of the right conferred upon them
by Article 57 of the Statute, append to the Judgment of the Court
statements of their separate opinions.

Vice-President ZAFRULLA KHAN states that he agrees with
Judge Hackworth.

President KLAESTAD and Judges WINIARSKI, ARMAND-UGON, Sir
Hersch LAUTERPACHT and SPIROPOULOS, availing themselves of the
right conferred upon them by Article 57 of the Statute, append to
the Judgment of the Court statements of their dissenting opinions.
