On behalf of the Republic of Italy,
at the hearing of 23 February 1989, repeated as final submissions at the hearing

2 March 1989 (afternoon):

“May it please the Court,
A. To adjudge and declare that the Application filed on 6 February


1987 by the United States Government is inadmissible because local
remedies have not been exhausted.

B. If not, to adjudge and declare:

(1) that Article III of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation
of 2 February 1948 has not been violated;

(2) that Article V, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Treaty has not been violated;

(3) that Article V, paragraph 2, of the Treaty, and the related provisions of
the Protocol to the Treaty, have not been violated;

(4) that Article VII of the Treaty has not been violated;

(5) that Article I of the Supplementary Agreement of 26 September 1951
has not been violated; and

(6) that no other Article of the Treaty or the Supplementary Agreement
has been violated.

C. On a subsidiary and alternative basis only: to adjudge and declare
that, even if there had been a violation of obligations under the Treaty or
the Supplementary Agreement, such violation caused no injury for which
the payment of any indemnity would be justified.

And, accordingly, to dismiss the claim.”

12. The claim of the United States in the present case is that Italy has
violated the international legal obligations which it undertook by the
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the two coun-
tries concluded on 2 February 1948 (“the FCN Treaty”) and the Supple-
mentary Agreement thereto concluded on 26 September 1951, by reason
of its acts and omissions in relation to, and its treatment of, two
United States corporations, the Raytheon Company (“Raytheon”) and
The Machlett Laboratories Incorporated (“Machlett”), in relation to the
Italian corporation Raytheon-Elsi S.p.A. (previously Elettronica Sicula
S.p.A. (ELSI)), which was wholly owned by the two United States cor-
porations. Italy contests certain of the facts alleged by the United States,
denies that there has been any violation of the FCN Treaty, and contends,
on a subsidiary and alternative basis, that if there was any such violation,
no injury was caused for which payment of any indemnity would be justi-
fied.

13. In 1955, Raytheon (then known as Raytheon Manufacturing Com-
pany) agreed to subscribe for 14 per cent of the shares in Elettronica Sic-
ula S.p.A. Over the period 1956-1967, Raytheon successively increased its
holding of ELSI shares (as well as investing capital in the company in
other ways) to a total holding of 99.16 per cent of its shares. In April 1963
the name of the company was changed from Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. to
“Raytheon-Elsi S.p.A.”; it will however be referred to hereafter as
“ELSI”. The remaining shares (0.84 per cent) in ELSI were acquired in
April 1967 by Machlett, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Raytheon.
ELSI was established in Palermo, Sicily, where it had a plant for the
production of electronic components; in 1967 it had a workforce of



slightly under 900 employees. Its five major product lines were microwave
tubes, cathode-ray tubes, semiconductor rectifiers, X-ray tubes and surge
arresters.

14. During the fiscal years 1964 to 1966 inclusive, ELSI made an op-
erating profit, but this profit was insufficient to offset its debt expense or
accumulated losses, and no dividends were ever paid to its shareholders.
In June 1964, the accumulated losses exceeded one-third of the com-
pany’s share capital, and ELSI was thus required by Article 2446 of the
Italian Civil Code to reduce its equity from 4,300 million lire to 2,000 mil-
lion lire. The capital stock was therefore devalued by 2,300 million lire and
recapitalized by an equal amount subscribed by Raytheon. A similar
operation was necessary in March 1967. In February 1967, according
to the United States, Raytheon began taking steps to endeavour to make
ELSI self-sufficient. Raytheon and Machlett designated a number of
highly-qualified personnel to provide financial, managerial and technical
expertise, and Raytheon provided a total of over 4,000 million lire in re-
capitalization and guaranteed credit. By December 1967, according to
the United States, major steps had been taken to upgrade plant facilities
and operations.

15. Atthe same time, however, the Chairman of ELSI, and other senior
Raytheon officials, held numerous meetings, between February 1967 and
March 1968, with cabinet-level officials of the Italian Government and of
the Sicilian region, as well as representatives of the Istituto per la Ricostru-
zione Industriale (“IRI”), the Ente Siciliano per la Produzione Industriale
(“ESPI”), and the private sector. IRI was a holding company controlled
by Italy with extensive commercial interests, and dominated at this time
the telecommunications, electronics and engineering markets. ESPI was
the Sicilian Government industrial organization responsible for the
promotion of local development. The purpose of these meetings was
stated to be to find for ELSI an Italian partner with economic power and
influence and to explore the possibilities of other governmental support.
The management of Raytheon had formed the view that, “without a part-
nership with IRI or other equivalent Italian Governmental entity, ELSI
would continue to be an outsider to the Italian industrial community”;
such a partnership would, it was thought, “positively influence govern-
ment decision-making in economic planning”, and enable ELSI also to
secure benefits and incentives under Italian legislation designed to favour
industrial development in the southern region, the Mezzogiorno. Evi-
dence has been given that the management of ELSI was advised that the
company was entitled to such Mezzogiorno benefits, but the Chamber has
been told by Italy that it was not so entitled. The support of the national
and regional governments was regarded as particularly important
because in numerous markets crucial to ELSI’s operations and success



the Italian Government, through IRI or otherwise, played a dominant role
as a customer. A detailed “Project for the Financing and Reorganization
of the Company” was prepared and submitted to ESPI in May 1967.

16. The management of ELSI took the view that one of the reasons for
its lack of success was that it had trained and was employing an exces-
sively large labour force. In June 1967 it was decided to dismiss some 300
employees; under an Italian union agreement this involved a procedure of
notifications and negotiations. On the intervention of ESPI, an alternative
plan was agreed to whereby 168 workers would be suspended from 10 July
1967, with limited pay by ELSI for a period not exceeding six weeks. After
a training programme during which the workers were paid by the Sicilian
Government, it was contemplated that ELSI would endeavour to re-
employ the suspended employees. The necessary additional business to
make this possible was not forthcoming, and the suspended employees

any additional loans which might be made by others to Raytheon-Elsi”.



18. This decision was stated to have been taken, inter alia, on review of
the proposed balance sheet showing the position on 30 September 1967;
that balance sheet showed the book value of the assets of ELSI as
17,956.3 million lire, its total debt as 13,123.9 million lire ; the accumulated
losses of 2,681.3 million lire had reduced the value of the equity (capital
stock and capital subscription account) from 4,000 million lire to
1,318.7 million lire. The total debt included a number of liabilities to one
United States bank and several Italian banks, some (but not all) of which
were guaranteed by Raytheon. For the purposes of a possible liquidation,
an asset analysis was prepared by the Chief Financial Officer of Raytheon
showing the expected position on 31 March 1968. This showed the book
value of ELST’s assets as 18,640 million lire; as explained in his affidavit
filed in these proceedings, it also showed “the minimum prospects of re-
covery of values which we could be sure of, in order to ensure an orderly
liquidation process”, and the total realizable value of the assets on this
basis (the “quick-sale value”) was calculated to be 10,838.8 million lire. A
balance sheet subsequently prepared to show the position at 31 March
1968, extrapolated from the balance sheet at 30 September 1967, showed
the book value of total assets as 17,053.5 million lire and total debt of
12,970.6 million lire.

19. During the hearings, at the request of the Agent of Italy, the Cham-
ber asked the Government of the United States to produce the financial
report showing ELSI’s financial position at 30 September 1967, from
which the figures for the book value of its assets had been derived. The
report, prepared by Raytheon’s Italian auditors, and dated 22 March
1968, was produced in evidence. The balance sheet attached thereto
showed two sets of figures; the first of these, corresponding to the figures
for assets and liabilities set out in paragraph 18 above, gave the figures as
recorded in the company’s books of account. The second set of figures
was based on the first set, but a number of adjustments had been made
in accordance with the financial accounting policy of Raytheon “In
order to assure comparability of the financial information reported from
abroad” by its subsidiary companies. According to the Co-Agent of
the United States, the major difference between the accounts on the
Italian basis and the Raytheon basis was

“the item of Deferred Charges, which for the most part represented
the cost of developing new lines and improving product quality. This
asset is carried on the Italian books but is routinely written off by
Raytheon Company.”

The adjustment of the item for “Deferred Charges” reduced the total
assets figure by 1,653 million lire. Taking all adjustments into account,



the second set of figures gave a value of 14,893.9 million lire for the assets,
and 15,775.2 million lire for the liabilities. The auditors stated in their
covering letter to Raytheon accountants that

“The adjustments made by the company in preparing the above
mentioned balance sheet and statement of income and accumulated
losses have not, at the date of this report, been recorded in the books,
essentially for tax reasons. Accordingly, the accompanying financial
statements are not in agreement with the company’s books of
account.”

Among the “Notes on Financial Statements” attached to the accounts by
the auditors was the following:

“10. The adjusted accumulated losses at September 30, 1967
exceeded the total of the paid up capital stock, capital reserve and
Stockholders subscription account by an amount of 881.3 million
lire. Should this become ‘officially’ the case (e.g. should the adjust-
ments made in arriving at this total of accumulated losses be entered
in the company’s books of account), under Articles 2447 and 2448 of
the Italian Civil Code the directors would be obliged to convene a
Stockholders’ Meeting forthwith to take measures either to cover the
losses by providing new capital or to put the company into liquida-
tion.”

The auditors also expressed reservations on two other items totalling
1,168.5 million lire.

20. The officials of Raytheon and ELSI were nevertheless advised by
their Italian counsel in March 1968 that “ELSI’s capital, after taking into
account losses to date at that time, was well in excess of the minimum
statutory requirement” (1 million lire) under Articles 2447 and 2448 of the
Italian Civil Code, which provide that if action is not taken to restore the
capital to the required minimum, the company is dissolved as a matter of
law. In the view of ELSI’s counsel, “it was therefore possible under Italian
law for ELST’s shareholders to plan an orderly liquidation of the com-
pany”.

21. Throughout this Judgment this phrase “orderly liquidation” is used
solely in the sense in which it was employed by the officers of ELSI and by
the representatives of the United States, i.e., to denote the operation
planned in 1967-1968 by ELSI’s management for the sale of the business
or of its assets, en bloc or separately, and the discharge of ELSPs debts,
fully or otherwise, out of the proceeds, the whole operation being under
the control of ELSI’s own management.

22. According to the United States, the chief objectives in the planned
orderly liquidation were to conserve the assets and preserve as many of the



characteristics of a going concern as possible in order to attract and inter-
est prospective buyers; it was planned to advertise ELSI’s assets widely,
offering them both as a total package and as separate items — the distinct
manufacturing lines of the plant. The intention was, if the sums realized
by the sale of the assets were sufficient, to pay all creditors in full. Plan-
ning had however also proceeded on the basis of the “quick-sale” valua-
tion of the assets (paragraph 18 above), which, it was recognized, was less
than the total liabilities of the company. It was not considered possible to
continue normal production; the personnel was to be dismissed, with the
exception of some 120 key employees needed for the wind-up operation
and for continuing limited production for a time to meet (in particular)
military contracts and maintain customer contact.

23. The intended treatment of creditors in the planned liquidation, in
the event of only the “quick-sale” value being realized, was stated by the
Financial Controller of Raytheon to have been as follows:

“Ideally, we would settle first with the small creditors, subject, of
course, to the agreement of the major creditors, in order to minimize
the administrative effort during liquidation. Secured and preferred
creditors would take priority and would be paid when the assets used
for collateral were sold. Major unsecured creditors were to be paid
on a pro rata basis from within the funds realized from the sale of
assets. Then Raytheon would be called upon to satisfy any guaran-
teed creditor to the extent not already paid from asset sale proceeds.
We calculated that the secured and preferred creditors would receive
100 per cent of their outstanding claims, while the unsecured major
creditors who were not covered by Raytheon guarantees would
realize about 50 per cent of their claims. The latter creditors were
certain banks and Raytheon and its subsidiaries. We were confident
that an orderly liquidation of this type would be acceptable to the
creditors as it was much more favorable than could be expected
through bankruptcy.”

According to the United States, settlement with all the smaller creditors
was regarded as a priority

“to reduce the creditors to a manageable number and also to elimi-
nate the risk that a small irresponsible creditor would take preci-
pitous action which would raise formidable obstacles in the way of
orderly liquidation”.

Appended to one of the affidavits by officers of Raytheon and ELSI an-
nexed to the United States Memorial were detailed calculations showing
(inter alia) various valuations of ELSI’s assets, analysis of the company’s



liabilities and their priority in liquidation, and estimated distribution
of the proceeds of disposal of assets calculated both on book value and
alternatively on a “minimum liquidation value”.

24. It is contended by the United States that notwithstanding
Raytheon’s formal notification on 7 March 1968 that it would not sub-
scribe to any further stock or guarantee any additional loans (para-
graph 17 above, in fine), Raytheon was ready to give certain financial
support and guarantees to enable the orderly liquidation to proceed, as
distinct from making more funds available to ELSI for continued opera-
tions. According to officials of ELSI, if Raytheon had handled the liqui-
dation as planned, it would have guaranteed the settlements outlined in
the previous paragraph; they stated that

“Demonstrating its support of the liquidation plan, Raytheon
organized to provide funds to ELSI in advance of the sale of its assets
so that disbursements could easily be made to the small creditors and,
as a first step, transferred 150 million lire to the First National
City Bank branch in Milan specifically for that purpose.”

Evidence was given at the hearing that payment of small creditors out of
these funds was begun, but then stopped by the creditor banks because
this was “showing preference”. It was contemplated that Raytheon would
take over ELSI’s accounts receivable (subsequently valued at some
2,879 million lire) at face value, thus supplying immediate cash resources.

25. Inthe view of ELST’s legal counsel at the time (paragraph 20 above)
and of Italian lawyers consulted by the United States, ELSI was in March
1968 entitled to engage in orderly liquidation of its assets, was under no
obligation to file a petition in bankruptcy, and was never in jeopardy of
compulsory dissolution under Article 2447 of the Italian Civil Code, and
was at all times in compliance with Article 2446 of the Code. It has how-
ever been contended by Italy that ELSI was in March 1968 unable to pay
its debts, and its capital of 4,000 million lire was completely lost; accord-
ingly, an orderly liquidation was not available to it, but as an insolvent
debtor it was under an obligation to file a petition in bankruptcy. The dis-
agreement turns on the value of ELSI’s assets for this purpose at 31 March
1968: the Parties have made conflicting statements of what is correct
accounting practice for the purposes of compliance with the relevant
requirements of Italian law. It has also been observed by Italy that, whether
or not ELSI was insolvent, the procedure contemplated did not corre-
spond to a voluntary liquidation as provided for in Article 2450 of the
Italian Civil Code; under that procedure a liquidator has to be appointed
by the shareholders, or if they fail to do so, by the Tribunal. According to
one expert appearing on behalf of Italy, ELSI being insolvent the only



course open to it in order to avoid the duty of filing a petition in bank-
ruptcy was to request to the tribunal to be admitted to the procedure of
judicial settlement (“concordato preventivo”) under Articles 160 et seq. of
the Italian Bankruptcy Act; this would have required proof that at least
40 per cent of the unsecured claims would be met. The expert appearing
on behalf of the United States however stated that apparent inability to
pay all creditors at 100 per cent is not fatal to voluntary and orderly liqui-
dation. In this context he mentioned in particular the practice of “private
settlement” (“concordato stragiudiziale”).

26. The management of ELSI was conscious that a financial crisis was
imminent, and during the period from September 1967, the responsible
officers of the company were keeping a close watch on the declining funds
to ensure that the company did not reach a point where continued opera-
tion would be contrary to Italian law. At à meeting held on 21 February
1968 between representatives of Raytheon and ELSI and the President of
the Sicilian region, the Chairman of ELSI “drew a precise time chart
showing: (a) February 23 — Board Meeting; (b) February 26 to 29 —
inevitable bank crisis; (¢) March 8 — we run out of money and shut
the plant”; the hand-written minutes of that meeting record also that
“the date of March 8 was stressed repeatedly as the absolute limit for the
shut-down due to a total financial crisis”.

27. On 16 March 1968, the Board of Directors of ELSI met to consider
areport on the financial situation, and concluded “that there is no alterna-
tive to the discontinuation of the company’s activities”; the Board

“decided the cessation of the company’s operations, to be carried out

as follows:

(1) production will be discontinued immediately;

(2) commercial activities and employment contracts will be termi-
nated on March 29, 1968”.

This decision was notified to the employees of ELSI by a letter of
16 March 1968. On 28 March 1968, a meeting of shareholders of ELSI was
held, at which it was decided (inter alia) “to ratify the resolutions adopted
by the Board of Directors at the meeting of March 16, 1968, and hence to
agree that the Company cease operations”. Meetings with Italian officials
however continued up to 29 March 1968; the Italian authorities continued
to give broad assurances of an intervention by ESPI, and vigorously
pressed ELSI not to close the plant and not to dismiss the workforce, but
the officials of the company insisted that this was inevitable unless more
capital was forthcoming. On 29 March 1968 letters of dismissal were
mailed to the employees of ELSI.



28. The Managing Director of ELSI had a meeting early on the mom-
ing of 31 March 1968 with the President of the Sicilian region, Mr. Carollo,
at which the latter stated that the Italian Prime Minister had said that a
company would be formed by ESPI and IMI (Istituto Mobiliare Italiano)
to deal with the acquisition of ELSI’s assets, and that a holding company
would be formed which would eventually own ELSI. Mr. Carollo con-
tinued by saying that “to keep the people in Palermo and avoid an exodus
to other jobs, and to protect the plant and machinery, the plant would be
requisitioned ...”. On 1 April 1968 representatives of the company met
representatives of the bank creditors of ELSI to discuss the company’s
plans for an orderly liquidation. According to the United States, ELST’s
representatives stated that Raytheon was not prepared to provide any
further financial support to ELSI either by way of capital, loans, advances,
or guarantees, but also informed the banks of the arrangement (referred
to in paragraph 24 above) which would provide for ELSPs immediate
cash needs in such an orderly liquidation through the sale to Raytheon
of ELSI’s accounts receivable at 100 per cent of face value, the proceeds
being used to pay off the small creditors and to meet payroll and sever-
ance pay claims as well as other pressing priority obligations.

29. No agreement was reached at that meeting; certain of the banks
requested more information, and another meeting was to be held later
with an agreed agenda. Subsequently ELSI’s representatives learnt that
the plant had been requisitioned. According to the United States, and in
the view of the officers of Raytheon and ELSI, there was reason to believe
that in a liquidation the creditor banks would have accepted a settlement
of their claims on payment of 40 to 50 per cent of each, but no independent
evidence is available that such was the banks’ attitude at that time. It does
not appear from the evidence that the banks were asked specifically at the
meeting of 1 April 1968 whether they would co-operate on the basis of a
guaranteed 50 per cent of their claims; on the contrary, it was contended
on behalf of the United States by ELSI’s then legal adviser that

“There is no evidence of bank negotiations at the time of the requi-
sition because at the time the stockholders were fully confident that
ELSI’s assets would have recovered book value, and there was no
need at the time to start any such negotiations. What the stockholders
and ELSTs Board were seeking at the time was an understanding
with the banks on the manner and timing of an orderly liquidation.”



According to the same legal adviser, the banks were ready, during negotia-
tions in September-October 1968, after ELSI had been declared bankrupt,
to accept settlement on the basis of 40 per cent or 50 per cent payment (see
paragraph 37 below).

30. On 1 April 1968 the Mayor of Palermo issued an order, effective
immediately, requisitioning ELSI’s plant and related assets for a period
of six months. The text of this order, in the translation supplied by the
United States, was as follows:

“The Mayor of the Municipality of Palermo,

Taking into consideration that Raytheon-Elsi of Palermo has
decided to close its plant located in this city at Via Villagrazia, 79,
because of market difficulties and lack of orders;

That the company has furthermore decided to send dismissal
letters to the personnel consisting of about 1,000 persons;

Taking notice that ELSI’s actions, beside provoking the reaction of
the workers and of the unions giving rise to strikes (both general and
sectional) has caused a wide and general movement of solidarity of
all public opinion which has strongly stigmatized the action taken
considering that about 1,000 families are suddenly destituted;

That, considering the fact that ELSI is the second firm in order of
importance in the District, because of the shutdown of the plant
a serious damage will be caused to the District, which has been so
severely tried by the earthquakes had during the month of January
1968:

Considering also that the local press is taking a great interest in the
situation and that the press is being very critical toward the authori-
ties and is accusing them of indifference to this serious civic prob-
lem;

That, furthermore, the present situation is particularly touchy and
unforeseeable disturbances of public order could take place;

Taking into consideration that in this particular instance there is
sufficient ground for holding that there is a grave public necessity
and urgency to protect the general economic public interest (already
seriously compromised) and public order, and that these reasons jus-
tify requisitioning the plant and all equipment owned by Raytheon-
Elsi located here at Via Villagrazia 79;

Having noted Article 7 of the law of 20 March 1865 No. 2248 enclo-
sure e;
Having noted Article 69 of the Basic Regional Law EE.LL.,



ORDERS

the requisition, with immediate effect and for the duration of six
months, except as may be necessary to extend such period, and with-
out prejudice for the rights of the parties and of third parties, of the
plant and relative equipment owned by Raytheon-Elsi of Palermo.

With a subsequent decree, the indemnification to be paid to said
company for the requisition will be established.”

The order was served on the company on 2 April 1968.

31. On 6 April 1968 the Mayor issued an order entrusting the manage-
ment of the requisitioned plant to Mr. Aldo Profumo, the Managing Di-
rector of ELSI, for the purpose, inter alia, of “avoiding any damage to the
equipment and machinery due to the abandoning of all activity, including
maintenance”. Mr. Profumo declined to accept this appointment, and on
16 April 1968 the Mayor wrote to Mr. Silvio Laurin, the senior director,
appointing him temporarily to replace Mr. Profumo “in the same capa-
city, with the same powers, functions and limitations”, and Mr. Laurin
accepted this appointment. The company management requested another
of its directors, Mr. Rico Merluzzo, to stay at the plant night and day
“to preclude local authorities from somehow asserting that the plant
had been ‘abandoned’ by ELSI”.

32. On 9 April 1968 ELSI addressed a telegram to the Mayor of Pal-
ermo, with copies to other Government authorities, claiming (inter alia)
that the requisition was illegal and expressing the company’s intention to
take all legal steps to have it revoked and to claim damages. On 12 April
1968 the company served on the Mayor a formal document dated 11 April
1968 inviting him to revoke the requisition order. The Mayor did not re-
spond and the order was not revoked, and on 19 April 1968 ELSI brought
an administrative appeal against it to the Prefect of Palermo, who was
empowered to hear appeals against decisions by local governmental
officials. The decision on that appeal was not given until 22 August 1969
(paragraph 41 below); in the meantime however the requisition was
not formally prolonged, and therefore ceased to have legal effect
after six months, more than four months after the bankruptcy of ELSI
had been declared (paragraph 36 below).

33. As noted above (paragraph 16) the Parties disagree over whether,
immediately prior to the requisition order, there had been any occupation
of ELSI’s plant by the employees, but it is common ground that the plant
was so occupied during the period immediately following the requisition.
On 19 April 1968 the representatives of the company stated, in an appeal
against the requisition addressed to the Prefect of Palermo, that there had
at that time been no occupation of the plant as a consequence of the dis-
missal of the employees on 29 March 1968, but that on 30 March 1968 a
group of representatives of the personnel went to the plant to talk to the



company executives and “peacefully remained thereafter all day on the
premises”, and on subsequent days a small group of employees wandered
about on the premises. The Mayor of Palermo, in an affidavit, has stated
that

“The occupation of the plant by the employees (which started well
before the requisition) turned out to be of a ‘cooperative’ nature after
the requisition and was no obstacle to the continuation of those acti-
vities which were possible under the circumstances”,

and an official of the Municipality of Palermo has stated, in an affidavit,
that “there were no problems such as ‘hard’ picketing” and that one of the
production lines was re-activated and “we proceeded regularly with the
contracts in hand”. According to an affidavit filed by the United States
“the plant sat idle for the remainder of 1968”, but Italy has produced evi-
dence showing that some work in progress was continued and completed
in the months following the requisition, in particular for the Nato Hawk
programme.

34. On 19 and 20 April 1968 meetings were held between officials of
Raytheon and the President of the Sicilian region, Mr. Carollo, who stated
that “the Regional and Central Governments had reached agreement to
form a management company with IRI participation to operate ELSI”
and invited Raytheon to join the management company. The proposal
would have entailed the contribution by ELSI of new capital and its as-
suming complete responsibility for past debts; in the discussion Mr. Car-
ollo stated that “the Region now has a single goal, to keep the workers
employed”. At the request of Raytheon, Mr. Carollo, on 20 April 1968
supplied Raytheon with a memorandum to provide the company with
“some fundamental elements of judgment”. In that memorandum he
explained that it was impossible for the time being for Raytheon to liqui-
date ELSI, for the following reasons:

“1. Nobody in Italy will purchase [Nessuno in Italia comprerd],
that is to say IRI will not purchase, neither for a low nor for a high
price, the Region will not purchase, private enterprise will not
‘purchase. Let me add that the Region and IRI and anybody else who
has any possibility to influence the market will refuse in the most
absolute manner to favor any sale while the plant is closed.

2. The Banks, which have outstanding credits for approximately
16 billion Lire, cannot and will not accept any settlement even at the
cost of dragging the Company into litigation on an international
level. I mean to refer to Raytheon and not to ELSI because the dis-
tinction between ELSI and Raytheon is not found to be admissible,
since any and all financing was granted to ELSI based on the moral



guarantee of Raytheon, whose executives have always negotiated
said financing.

3. Anyway, it is known in Italy that one can enforce the claims
directly against Raytheon because it has interests and revenues in our
country also outside ELSI.

It is obvious that every attempt will be made (even at the cost of
long litigation) to obtain from Raytheon what is owed by ELSI.

4. Inthe event that the plant will be kept closed, waiting for Italian
buyers who will never materialize, the requisition will be maintained
at least until the courts will have resolved the case. Months will go
by...”

35. On 26 April 1968 the Chairman of the Board of ELSI wrote to
Mr. Carollo formally rejecting the proposal for participation in the new
management company; in his view the proposal “was a temporary care-
taker measure which would not solve the fundamental problem, namely
keeping ELSI in Sicily and making it a viable and vital industry”, and that
it “would only aggravate ELSD’s critical financial condition”. The letter
continued: “We are therefore forced to file [a] voluntary petition for bank-
ruptcy, as required by Italian law.”

36. Inview of what had been said by Mr. Carollo that the requisition of
the plant would be maintained for months, “at least until the courts will
have resolved the case”, ELSI’s Italian counsel advised as follows :

“The disposability of ELSI’s assets was a fundamental prerequi-
site to ELSI’s shareholders’ ability to take ELSI through an orderly
liquidation; they were relying on the proceeds of these sales in large
partto pay ELSI’s creditors in an orderly manner. Without the ability
to dispose of its assets, ELSI would not have the liquidity needed to
pay its debts as they came due and therefore would soon become
technically insolvent under Italian law.

I advised ELST’s directors that they had an obligation to file a peti-
tion for a declaration of bankruptcy, failing which they could be held
personally liable pursuant to Article 217 of the Bankruptcy Law,
Royal Decree of March 16, 1942, No. 267.”

On 25 April 1968 the Board of Directors voted to file a voluntary petition
in bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy petition was filed on 26 April 1968.
The petition referred to the requisition order of 1 April 1968 and stated
(inter alia):

“Because of the order of requisition, against which the Company



has in due time filed an appeal, the Company has lost the control of
the plant and cannot avail itself of an immediate source of liquid
funds; in the meanwhile payments have become due (as for instance
instalments of long-term loans; an instalment of Lit. 800,000,000 to
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro became due on April 18, 1968 and the
note therefor has been or will be protested, etc.); it is acknowledged
that it is impossible for the Company to pay such sums with the funds
existing or available such impossibility being due to the events of
these last weeks. . .”

A decree of bankruptcy was issued by the Tribunale di Palermo on 16 May
1968, and a Palermo lawyer was appointed curatore (trustee in bank-
rupicy). À creditors’ committee of five members was appointed, com-
posed of two representatives of ELSPs employees, two representatives of
bank creditors, and a representative of Raytheon Europe International
Company (“Raytheon Europe”) (the European management subsidiary
of, and wholly owned by, Raytheon), which had submitted a claim as
creditor in the bankruptcy. Raytheon itself and another of its subsidi-
aries, Raytheon Service Company, had unsecured claims against ELSI of
some 1,140 million lire for goods and services they had advanced to ELSI
on unsecured open accounts. On advice of Italian counsel, however,
Raytheon and Raytheon Service Company did not file claims in the bank-
ruptcy proceedings because it was clear that they would not receive
enough in the bankruptcy to justify their filing costs.

37. From April 1968 onwards discussions were held between
Raytheon’s Italian counsel, representatives of the creditor banks and offi-
cials of the Italian Government, with a view to the takeover of ELSI by a
company owned by the Italian Government and a settlement with the
ELSI creditors. This proposed settlement involved the grant to the new
company by Raytheon of a technical license (to use Raytheon patents and
know-how) of the same scope as ELSI had; the payment by Raytheon of
the debts of ELSI which it had guaranteed, but no others, and a formal
release and indemnity of Raytheon in this latter respect; and a waiver by
Raytheon of its rights of subrogation resulting from payment of the guar-
anteed debts. According to Raytheon’s Italian counsel, he was told by
Italian Government officials in October 1968 that the majority of the
Italian creditor banks were agreeable to a settlement on payment of
40 per cent of their claims, and that only one bank was holding out for
50 per cent. In July, a statement had been made in the Italian Parliament
by the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Crafts, which has been sub-
ject to differing interpretations, but which put forward as a fact the
establishment by the Sicilian region and other public agencies of a
management company, which would allow productive activities to be
resumed until such time as the financial problems of ELSI could be



finally resolved, if possible through settlement out of court. On 13 No-
vember 1968 the Italian Government issued a press communiqué which
stated that

“while the STET Group [Societa finanziaria telefonica, an affiliate
or subsidiary of IRI] remains committed to build a new plant in
Palermo for the production of telecommunication products, the
IRI-STET Group, urged by the Government, after the examination
of alternative solutions which proved unfeasible, stated its willing-
ness to intervene in the take-over of the [ELSI] plant in the organi-
zation of new lines of production”.

According to the communiqué, the conditions of STET’s intervention
were to be agreed between the STET Group and the authorities of the
Sicilian region.

38. The court dealing with the bankruptcy ordered an auction of
ELSP's premises, plant and equipment to be held on 18 January 1969, and
set a minimum bid of 5,000 million lire. This auction, and the subsequent
auctions mentioned below, were advertised in leading newspapers both in
Italy and in Belgium, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
the United States. No bids were received at this auction, and a second
auction was set for 22 March 1969, this time with the inclusion also of the
entire inventory at the plant and elsewhere, the minimum bid being set at
6,223,293,258 lire. In the meantime negotiations were being carried on for
a takeover of the plant by an IRI subsidiary and the re-employment of
most of ELSI’s former staff. It was reported in the Sicilian press, first that
on 18 March 1969 it had been agreed that IRI would acquire ELST’s assets,
beginning with a lease of the plant for 150 million lire, and secondly that
the former President of Sicily, Mr. Carollo, had stated at a public meet-
ing on 5 April 1969 that there had been a written agreement with IRI in
October 1968 that

“entailed the acquisition of the [ELSI] factory by IRI for the sum of
four billion lire. It was even agreed that IRI would be absent from the
first auction, participating instead in the second one, where the basic
price was precisely four billion lire”.

39. No bids were received at the second auction. A week later a propo-
sal to lease and re-open the plant was made to the trustee in bankruptcy by
ELTEL (Industria Elettronica Telecommunicazioni S.p.A.), a subsidiary
of IRI set up in December 1968. The terms proposed for the lease were not
acceptable as such to the creditors’ committee, which did however recom-



mend (inter alia)that it should be granted if ELTEL agreed to purchase all
ELSI’s inventorial raw material for 1,800 million lire; the representative
of Raytheon Europe on the committee vigorously opposed the lease. The
trustee in bankruptcy however recommended that the lease be granted on
the terms requested, and on 8 April 1969 the bankruptcy judge so directed.
Raytheon Europe appealed against this decision but without success. A
third auction was scheduled for May 1969; in April ELTEL proposed to
buy the work in progress — the material left on ELSI’s production lines
when the plant was requisitioned — for 105 million lire; this had been
valued in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings at 217 million lire.
Raytheon Europe’s representative on the creditors’ committee opposed
this sale, but was outvoted.

40. The third auction of ELSI’s premises, plant and equipment and in-
ventory was held on 3 May 1969, the minimum bid being set at 5,000 mil-
lion lire, but again no bids were received. ELTEL had informed the bank-
ruptcy court on 16 April 1969 that it was willing to offer 3,205 million lire
for the premises, plant and equipment, excluding the supplies — “mer-
chandise, raw materials and semifinished goods” — which it did not re-
gard as indispensable. On 3 May 1969, the trustee in bankruptcy requested
the bankruptcy court to approve a sale of the work in progress to ELTEL
on the terms proposed by ELTEL and approved by the creditors’ commit-
tee. On 9 May 1969, Raytheon Europe’s appeal against the decision
authorizing the lease of the premises and plant to ELTEL was rejected.
On 27 May 1969 ELTEL made an offer to the bankruptcy court to buy
the remaining plant, equipment and supplies for 4,000 million lire. The trus-
tee in bankruptcy proposed acceptance (subject to minor changes in the
terms), and the creditors’ committee decided on 6 June 1969 to approve
the proposal, the Raytheon Europe representative voting against. On
7 June 1969 the bankruptcy judge set 12 July 1969 as date for an auction on
the terms approved by the creditors’ committee. On 9 June 1969 Raytheon
Europe appealed against this decision, but the appeal was rejected on
20 June 1969. The auction was held on 12 July 1969, and ELTEL pur-
chased the auctioned property at the total price of 4,006 million lire.

41. The appeal filed by ELSI on 19 April 1968 (paragraph 32 above)
against the requisition order of 1 April 1968 was determined by the Prefect
of Palermo by a decision given on 22 August 1969. The Parties are at issue
on the question whether this period of time was or was not normal for an
appeal of this character. The decision on the appeal was given following a
request to that effect by the trustee in bankruptcy made on 9 July 1969, in
exercise of a right to request a decision conferred by an Italian Law of
3 March 1934. That Law provides that if the appeal has not been heard 120
days after it has been filed (i.e., in this case by 17 August 1968), a request



may be served on the Prefect requiring him to render a decision within
60 days thereafter; if he fails to do so, this is treated as a dismissal of the
appeal. The decision of the Prefect was to uphold the appeal and thus to
annul the requisition order made by the Mayor of Palermo; the precise
terms of the decision will be considered later in this Judgment (para-
graphs 75, 96, 125 and 126). The Mayor of Palermo appealed against the
Prefect’s decision to the President of Italy who, having been advised by
the Council of State that the Mayor’s appeal was inadmissible, so ruled on
22 April 1972.

42. In the meantime, on 16 June 1970 the trustee in bankruptcy had
brought proceedings in the Tribunale di Palermo (“the Court of Palermo”)
against the Minister of the Interior of Italy and the Mayor of Palermo for
damages resulting from the requisition. The damages claimed were iden-
tified as

“the considerable decrease in value of the plant and the electronic
equipment existing in Palermo at 79 Via Villagrazia, which results
from the difference between the book value at the date of the bank-
ruptcy of Raytheon-Elsi, of Lire 6,623,000,000 and the evaluation
made on October 11, 1968 (that is, immediately after the six-month
period of requisition had elapsed) by the Court Appraiser, Prof.
Mario Puglisi, appointed by the Judge by Decree of September 19,
1968, of Lire 4,560,588,400, with a real loss of value of
Lire 2,062,411,600 and as the lack of disposability of the plant and
relative equipment for six months which, on the basis of the amorti-
zation rate for the industrial plants, equal to 10% per year, can be
determined in Lire 33,150,000, and, therefore, in the aggregate
amount of Lire 2,395,561,600, plus the interests at the legal rate from
October 1, 1968 to the payment.”

43. On 2 February 1973, the Court of Palermo, in a decision to be
examined more fully below (paragraphs 57, 58, 97 and 127), ruled that
the trustee was not entitled to compensation for the requisition, either in
respect of the alleged decrease in value of the plant and equipment, or of
the alleged lack of disposability thereof. On appeal, the Corte di Appello di
Palermo (“the Court of Appeal of Palermo”), in its decision of 24 January
1974, upheld the conclusion of the lower court as regards the damages
claimed for the alleged decrease in value of the plant and equipment. It
however reversed the finding of the lower court on the second head of
damage, and found that the trustee was entitled to compensation from the
Minister of the Interior for loss of use and possession of ELSI’s plant and
assets during the six-month requisition period. It therefore awarded, in
effect, a “rental” payment of some 114 million lire, computed as half the
annual rate of 5 per cent of the total value of the assets. This decision,
which will be examined in more detail below (paragraphs 97,98 and 127),
was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 26 April 1975. The amount of



the judgment was ultimately received by the trustee and, less costs and
expenses, distributed to ELSI’s creditors.

44. In the bankruptcy proceedings, creditors presented claims against
ELSI totalling some 13,000 million lire; these did not include amounts
due to Raytheon and Raytheon Service Company (see paragraph 36
above). The bankruptcy proceedings closed in November 1985. Accord-
ing to the bankruptcy reports, the bankruptcy realized only some
6,370 million lire for ELSI’s assets, as compared with the minimum liqui-
dation value estimated by ELSI’s management in March 1968 at
10,840 million lire. Of the amount realized, some 6,080 million lire went to
pay banks, employees, and other creditors. The remainder went to pay
bankruptcy administration, tax, registry, and customs charges. All of the
secured and preferred creditors who filed claims in the bankruptcy were
paid in full. The unsecured creditors received less than one per cent of
their claims; accordingly no surplus remained for distribution to the
shareholders, Raytheon and Machlett.

45. Raytheon had guaranteed the indebtedness of ELSI to a number of
banks, and on the bankruptcy of ELSI it was accordingly liable for, and
paid, the sum of 5,787.6 million lire to the banks in accordance with the
terms of the guarantees. Five of the seven banks which had also made
unguaranteed loans to ELSI brought proceedings in the Italian courts
seeking payment of these loans by Raytheon, on the basis primarily of
Article 2362 of the Italian Civil Code, which renders a sole shareholder
liable for the debts of the company. It was argued that Raytheon was in
effect sole shareholder, since Machlett was its wholly-owned subsidiary.
Three of these cases were ultimately resolved by the Italian Court of Cas-
sation in favour of Raytheon, and two were discontinued by the plaintiffs.

46. On 7 February 1974, the Embassy in Rome of the United States
transmitted to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs a note enclosing the
“claim of the Government of the United States of America on behalf of
Raytheon Company and Machlett Laboratories, Incorporated”. That
claim, which was based not only on the FCN Treaty but also on customary
international law, incorporated a Memorandum of Law, Chapter VI of
which was devoted to “Exhaustion of Local Remedies”. It was there noted
that it was “generally recognized that local remedies must be exhausted
before a claim may be formally espoused under principles of international
law”; an account was given of the relevant litigation in Italy (some of
which was at the time still pending) and, in the light of annexed opinions



of two Italian legal experts, it was concluded that “Raytheon and Mach-
lett have exhausted every meaningful legal remedy available to them in
Italy”. At the time this claim was submitted, the Court of Appeal of Pal-
ermo had ruled on the action by the trustee in bankruptcy, but the case was
thereafter brought before the Court of Cassation (paragraph 43 above); it
is recognized by both Parties that any other action arising out of the requi-
sition would by then have been barred by limitation of time. It appears
that the United States received no formal response from Italy to the claim
until 13 June 1978, when Italy denied the claim in a written aide-mémoire,
the text of which has been supplied to the Chamber. The aide-mémoire
contained no suggestion that local remedies had not been exhausted, and
indeed stated that “the claim is juridically groundless, both from the inter-
national and domestic point of view”. During the oral proceedings in the
present case, counsel for Italy asserted that at an unspecified date prior to
the institution of the present proceedings the Italian Government “had
made it clear to the United States Government that as a Respondent it
would raise the objection of non-exhaustion of local remedies in judicial
proceedings”. No evidence to that effect has however been supplied to the
Chamber.

47. Many of the documents constituting evidence submitted to the
Chamber are in the Italian language. Where the Chamber relies in the
present Judgment on passages in these documents, it will, for the sake of
clarity, set out the original Italian together with an English translation,
which is not always the translation supplied by one of the Parties pursuant
to Article 51, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court.
