   The Court has declared that it lacks jurisdiction in the three cases
brought by the Marshall Islands against India, Pakistan and the United
Kingdom respectively, on the same grounds: the non-existence of a dis-
pute between the Parties. Consistently, I have voted against each of the
three Judgments adopted by the Court, and for the same reasons set forth
in this opinion.

   The reasoning of the Court, however, does not address the issue of
the customary nature of Article VI of the NPT which goes to the merits
of the case. The same applies to the Court’s consideration of whether or
not the Respondents have complied with the obligation to negotiate,
which is the subject-matter of the proceedings brought by the Marshall
Islands.
   Yet, with regard to the existence of a dispute, the Court has followed
the same approach to achieve a similar result in each of the three Judg-
ments.

the fact that the majority came to this conclusion only by an exercise in
pure formalism, artiﬁcially stopping the time of law and analysis at the
date of submission of the request by the Marshall Islands. And as if that
were not enough, the majority has resorted to a “criterion” bearing no
relation to the well-established case law whereby in order for a dispute to
exist, the respondent must have been “aware, or could not have been
unaware, that its views were ‘positively opposed’ by the applicant”
(para. 38).
   The introduction of this criterion, linked to the subjective views of the
Respondent and of those conducting the analysis, clearly goes against the
entire case law of the ICJ and PCIJ, according to which the existence of a
dispute is determined objectively by the Court on the basis of the evidence
available to it, when it adopts its judgment. The Court has thus been able
to administer justice soundly and avoid the absurd situation in which it
now ﬁnds itself after declaring that it lacks jurisdiction in the three
Judgments on Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of
the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament. Indeed, the Parties
have disagreed clearly before the Court on points of fact and law, thereby
demonstrating the existence of legal disputes on the questions submitted
to it.

   The Court, when faced with such situations, has ﬁrst noted that its
jurisdiction must normally be ascertained at the time of the institution of
the proceedings. But it has gone further and recalled that “like its prede-
cessor, [it] has also shown realism and ﬂexibility in certain situations in
which the conditions governing the Court’s jurisdiction were not fully
satisﬁed when proceedings were initiated but were subsequently satisﬁed,
before the Court ruled on its jurisdiction” (Application of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.
Serbia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 438,
para. 81)
   In particular, the Court refused to declare itself incompetent when it
was suﬃcient for the Applicant to “ﬁle a new application, identical to the
present one, which would be unassailable in this respect” (Application of
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 614, para. 26). Many more instances
could be cited in which the PCIJ, and then the ICJ, have rejected resort-
ing to a formalism that is excessive and contrary to the sound administra-
tion of justice.

   The only issue here was the scope of the obligation to negotiate laid
down in Article VI of the NPT, an obligation that is also part of custom-
ary international law according to the Marshall Islands:
         “Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotia-
      tions in good faith on eﬀective measures relating to cessation of the
      nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and
      on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and
      eﬀective international control.”
   This obligation is well known to all those who have attended the meet-
ings of States parties to the NPT, which have been held regularly for
more than 40 years or so. It is also known to the Court, which, in its
famous Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on Legality of the Threat or Use
of Nuclear Weapons, pronounced clearly on the subject as follows:

         “The legal import of that obligation goes beyond that of a mere
      obligation of conduct; the obligation involved here is an obligation
      to achieve a precise result — nuclear disarmament in all its aspects —
      by adopting a particular course of conduct, namely, the pursuit of
      negotiations on the matter in good faith.” (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I),
      p. 264, para. 99.)

   Judge Abraham referred to the well-established approach of the Court,
in his separate opinion appended to the Judgment in the Georgia v. Rus-
sian Federation case (Judgment on Preliminary Objections of 1 April 2011):
         “I shall ﬁrst observe that until the present case the Court, whenever
      required to decide on a preliminary objection based on the respond-
      ent’s contention that there was no dispute, has made its decision —
      rejecting the objection — in a few short paragraphs, and has made
      the determination as of the date on which it was ruling, ﬁnding that
      the parties held clearly conﬂicting views at that date on the matters
      constituting the subject of the application and consequently that a
      dispute existed between them.” (I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 226,
      para. 8.)
   However, the Court did not change its position when dealing with that

   The Court has recalled on numerous occasions that its determination
of the existence of a dispute “must turn on an examination of the facts”,
and that “[t]he matter is one of substance, not of form” which requires
“objective determination”. Such a dispute “may be inferred from the fail-
ure of a State to respond to a claim in circumstances where a response is
called for” (Application of the International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation),
Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 84, para. 30).

   In its previous case law, the Court took account of the positions
adopted by the parties during the proceedings when it sought to deter-
mine the dispute objectively. If it had not proceeded in such a way, the
Court could have arrived at an absurd conclusion by making time stand
still on the date when the Application was ﬁled; the subject of the dispute
might have changed, or even disappeared, according to the positions set
forth before the Court. Let us even suppose that the premises of a dispute
have taken shape before the ﬁling of the Application and that the oppos-
ing views have been expressed clearly during the proceedings, can the
Court then declare that it lacks jurisdiction on the basis of a question of
form and not of substance or content? At the risk, as in the present case,
of seeing the Applicant ﬁle a new application immediately after the ﬁnd-
ing of lack of jurisdiction is announced! Where is the sound administra-
tion of justice in all of that?

   Thus, in the Judgment on preliminary objections delivered on 11 July
1996 in the case concerning Application of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.
Yugoslavia), Yugoslavia contested the existence of a dispute with Bosnia
and Herzegovina regarding violation of the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court found that
Yugoslavia had “wholly denied all of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s allega-


613      nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. bennouna)

tions, whether at the stage of proceedings relating to the requests for the
indication of provisional measures, or at the stage of the . . . proceedings
relating to [preliminary] objections” (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 614,
para. 28), i.e., after the date when the Application was ﬁled.

   In the Judgment on preliminary objections delivered on 10 February
2005 in the case concerning Certain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany),
the Court referred to the parties’ positions during the proceedings in
order to determine the existence of a dispute. It thus found that “in the
present proceedings complaints of fact and law formulated by Liechten-
stein against Germany are denied by the latter”, concluding that “[i]n
conformity with well-established jurisprudence . . . there is a legal dis-
pute . . . between Liechtenstein and Germany” (I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 19,
para. 25). The Court relied in this respect on the precedent from the
Genocide case in 1996, as cited above. For the sake of completeness, it
should be mentioned that:
      “[t]he Court further notes that Germany’s position taken in the course
      of bilateral consultations and in the letter . . . of 20 January 2000
      [before the ﬁling of the Application] has evidentiary value in support
      of the proposition that Liechtenstein’s claims were positively opposed
      by Germany” (ibid.).
   In other words, the Court took note of the positions of the parties
prior to the ﬁling of the Application only once it had determined the exis-
tence of a dispute on the basis of the exchanges between them during the
proceedings. All of this serves to reinforce the practical, realistic and
pragmatic nature of the Court’s jurisprudence, in accordance with the
principle of consent upon which its jurisdiction is founded and with the
principle of equality between the parties.

(Nicaragua v. Colombia) (I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 3). First, however,
the Marshall Islands and the Respondent States had no knowledge of
that Judgment, since it was handed down on 17 March 2016, after the
closure of the oral proceedings in the present case, which took place from


614     nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. bennouna)

9 to 16 March 2016. And, second, it concerned a case in which, in the face
of all the evidence, Colombia argued that it was unaware of Nicaragua’s
position with regard to the implementation of and compliance with a
judgment of the Court.

   To my mind, the so-called determination of “being aware or having
been aware” cannot be used as a lifeline for a decision which is in no way
related to the well-established case law of the Court on this question. The
majority has tried to remove these two cases from their contexts. In the
Nicaragua v. Colombia case, the latter could not have been unaware of the
problem posed by the application of a judgment in a case to which it had
been party. In putting forward, on that basis, a new criterion for the exis-
tence of a dispute, the majority is seriously compromising the approach of
the Court in future to the question of whether a dispute exists.
   By placing itself, in this way, in a diﬃcult position which it has
attempted to justify, but without success, the majority is consequently not
allowing the Court to fulﬁl its function as the principal judicial organ of
the United Nations, whose task is to assist the parties in settling their
disputes and thereby to contribute to peace through the implementation
of international law.
