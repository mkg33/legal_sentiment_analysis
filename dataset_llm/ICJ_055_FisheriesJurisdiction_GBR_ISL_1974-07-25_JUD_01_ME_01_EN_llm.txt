[ am in agreement with the reasoning and conclusions of the Court, and
since the Judgment speaks for and stands by itself, I would not feel it
appropriate to make any gloss upon it.

To my regret, I have been obliged to vote against the Court’s Judgment.
However, to my mind my negative vote does not, strictly speaking, signify
opposition, since in a different context I would certainly have voted in
favour of the process which the Court considered it should follow to
arrive at its decision. In my view that decision is devoted to fixing the
conditions for exercise of preferential rights, for conservation of fish
species, and historic rights, rather than to responding to the primary
claim of the Applicant, which is for a statement of the law on a specific
point.

I would have all the more willingly endorsed the concept of preferential
rights inasmuch as the Court has merely followed its own decision in the
Fisheries case.
