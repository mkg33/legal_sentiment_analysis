16. In the present case, the United Kingdom has raised two objec-
tions: one to the jurisdiction of the Court and the other to the admissi-
bility of the Application. According to the United Kingdom, “both of
these are objections of an essentially preliminary character”. :

*

17. The Court will first consider the objection raised by the United
Kingdom to its jurisdiction.

18. Libya submits that the Court has jurisdiction on the basis of
Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Montreal Convention, which provides that:

“Any dispute between two or more Contracting States concerning
the interpretation or application of this Convention which cannot be
settled through negotiation, shall, at the request of one of them, be
submitted to arbitration. If within six months of the date of the
request for arbitration the Parties are unable to agree on the organi-
zation of the arbitration, any one of those Parties may refer the dis-
pute to the International Court of Justice by request in conformity
with the Statute of the Court.”

19. The Parties agree that the Montreal Convention is in force between
them and that it was already in force both at the time of the destruction
of the Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie, on 21 December 1988, and at the
time of filing of the Application, on 3 March 1992. However, the Respon-
dent contests the jurisdiction of the Court because, in its submission, all
the requisites laid down in Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Montreal
Convention have not been complied with in the present case.

+ * +

20. The Respondent expressly stated that it did not wish to contest
the jurisdiction of the Court on all of the same grounds it had relied
upon in the provisional measures phase of the proceedings, and restricted
itself to alleging that Libya had failed to show, first, that there existed a
legal dispute between the Parties and second, that such dispute, if any,
concerned the interpretation or application of the Montreal Conven-
tion and fell, as a result, within the terms of Article 14, paragraph 1, of
that Convention. Consequently, the United Kingdom did not, in the
present phase of the proceedings, reiterate its earlier arguments as to
whether or not the dispute that, in the opinion of Libya, existed between
the Parties could be settled by negotiation; whether Libya had made a


17 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

proper request for arbitration; and whether the six-month period
required by Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention had been com-
plied with.

21. The Court nonetheless considers it necessary to deal briefly with
these arguments. It observes that in the present case the Respondent has
always maintained that the destruction of the Pan Am aircraft over
Lockerbie did not give rise to any dispute between the Parties regarding
the interpretation or application of the Montreal Convention, and that,
for that reason, in the Respondent’s view, there was nothing to be settled
by negotiation under the Convention; the Court notes that the arbitra-
tion proposal contained in the letter sent on 18 January 1992 by the
Libyan Secretary of the People’s Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Co-operation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
United Kingdom met with no answer; and it notes, in particular, that the
Respondent clearly expressed its intention not to accept arbitration — in
whatever form — when presenting and strongly supporting resolution
731 (1992) adopted by the Security Council three days later, on 21 Janu-
ary 1992.

Consequently, in the opinion of the Court the alleged dispute between
the Parties could not be settled by negotiation or submitted to arbitration
under the Montreal Convention, and the refusal of the Respondent to
enter into arbitration to resolve that dispute absolved Libya from any
obligation under Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention to observe a
six-month period starting from the request for arbitration, before seising
the Court.

22. As recalled by the Parties, the Permanent Court of International
Justice stated in 1924 that “[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law
or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons”
(Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, 1924, P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 2,
p- 11). The present Court for its part, in its Judgment of 30 June 1995 in
the case concerning East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), emphasized the
following:

“In order to establish the existence of a dispute, ‘It must be
shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the
other’ (South West Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
LC. J. Reports 1962, p. 328); and further, “Whether there exists an
international dispute is a matter for objective determination’ (Inter-
pretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania,
First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).” (I. C.J.
Reports 1995, p. 100.)


18 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

23. In its Application and Memorial, Libya maintained that the
Montreal Convention was the only instrument applicable to the destruc-
tion of the Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie, for the following reasons:

(a) the Respondent and Libya are bound by the Montreal Convention
which is in force between the Parties;

(b) the Montreal Convention is specifically aimed at preventing that
type of action (third paragraph of the Preamble);

{c) the actions ascribed to the Libyan nationals are covered by Article 1
of the Montreal Convention;

(d) “the system of the Montreal Convention, as compared to the system
of the Charter, is both a lex posterior and a lex specialis; conse-
quently, for matters covered by that Convention, it must a priori
take precedence over the systems for which the Charter provides”;
and

(e) there is no other convention concerning international criminal law
in force which is applicable to these issues in the relations between
Libya and the United Kingdom.

24. The United Kingdom does not deny that, as such, the facts of the
case could fall within the terms of the Montreal Convention. However, it
emphasizes that, in the present case, from the time Libya invoked the
Montreal Convention, the United Kingdom has claimed that it was not
relevant as the question to be resolved had to do with “the . . . reaction of
the international community to the situation arising from Libya’s failure
to respond effectively to the most serious accusations of State involve-
ment in acts of terrorism”.

25. Consequently, the Parties differ on the question whether the destruc-
tion of the Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie is governed by the Montreal
Convention. A dispute thus exists between the Parties as to the legal
régime applicable to this event. Such a dispute, in the view of the Court,
concerns the interpretation and application of the Montreal Convention,
and, in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention, falls
to be decided by the Court.



“1, Any person commits an offence if he unlawfully and inten-
tionally:

(a) performs an act of violence against a person on board an air-
craft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that
aircraft; or

(b) destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an air-
craft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to
endanger its safety in flight; or

(c) places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any
means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to
destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it
incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to
endanger its safety in flight; or

(d) destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with
their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety
of aircraft in flight; or

(e) communicates information which he knows to be false, thereby
endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.



2. Any person also commits an offence if he:

(a) attempts to commit any of the offences mentioned in para-
graph 1 of this Article; or

(b) is an accomplice of a person who commits or attempts to com-
mit any such offence.”

Article 5 provides:

“1. Each Contracting State shall take such measures as may be
necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences in the follow-
ing cases:

{a} when the offence is committed in the territory of that State;

(b) when the offence is committed against or on board an aircraft
registered in that State;

{c) when the aircraft on board which the offence is committed
lands in its territory with the alleged offender still on board;

(d) when the offence is committed against or on board an aircraft
leased without crew to a lessee who has his principal place of
business or, if the lessee has no such place of business, his per-
manent residence, in that State.

2. Each Contracting State shall likewise take such measures as
may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences men-
tioned in Article 1, paragraph 1 (a), (b) and (c), and in Article 1,
paragraph 2, in so far as that paragraph relates to those offences, in
the case where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it
does not extradite him pursuant to Article 8 to any of the States
mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article.

3. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction
exercised in accordance with national law.”

Article 6, for its part, states:


“1. Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, any
Contracting State in the territory of which the offender or the
alleged offender is present, shall take him into custody or take other
measures to ensure his presence. The custody and other measures
shall be as provided in the law of that State but may only be con-
tinued for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extra-
dition proceedings to be instituted.

2. Such State shall immediately make a preliminary enquiry into
the facts.

3. Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article
shall be assisted in communicating immediately with the nearest
appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national.

4. When a State, pursuant to this Article, has taken a person into

21 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

custody, it shall immediately notify the States mentioned in Ar-
ticle 5, paragraph 1, the State of nationality of the detained person
and, if it considers it advisable, any other interested State of the fact
that such person is in custody and of the circumstances which war-
rant his detention. The State which makes the preliminary enquiry
contemplated in paragraph 2 of this Article shall promptly report its
findings to the said States and shall indicate whether it intends to
exercise jurisdiction.”

Article 7 is worded in the following terms:

“The Contracting State in the territory of which the alleged
offender is found shall, if it does not extradite him, be obliged, with-
out exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was com-
mitted in its territory, to submit the case to its competent authorities
for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take their
decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of
a serious nature under the law of that State.”

Finally, in the words of Article 8:

“1. The offences shall be deemed to be included as extraditable
offences in any extradition treaty existing between Contracting
States. Contracting States undertake to include the offences as extra-
ditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between
them.

2. If a Contracting State which makes extradition conditional on
the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from
another Contracting State with which it has no extradition treaty, it
may at its option consider this Convention as the legal basis for
extradition in respect of the offences. Extradition shall be subject to
the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State.

3. Contracting States which do not make extradition conditional
on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences as extra-
ditable offences between themselves subject to the conditions pro-
vided by the law of the requested State.

4. Each of the offences shall be treated, for the purpose of extra-
dition between Contracting States, as if it had been committed not
only in the place in which it occurred but also in the territories of the
States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with
Article 5, paragraph 1 (b), (c) and (d).”

29. In view of the positions put forward by the Parties, the Court finds
that there exists between them not only a dispute of a general nature, as
defined in paragraph 25 above, but also a specific dispute which concerns
the interpretation and application of Article 7 — read in conjunction
with Article 1, Article 5, Article 6 and Article 8 — of the Montreal


22 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

Convention and which, in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 1, of
the Convention, falls to be decided by the Court.

*

30. Furthermore, Libya maintained in its Application and Memorial
that, once it had commenced its judicial investigation of the two alleged
offenders, the Respondent was, according to Article 11, paragraph 1, of
the Montreal Convention, under an obligation to hand over to the
Libyan authorities all the evidence in its possession regarding the offence.
In Libya’s opinion, this obligation was not duly complied with, because
the United Kingdom only transmitted “a copy of the statement of the
facts” against the accused, a document that “contains no evidence of
which the Libyan judiciary could make use”.

31. In this connection, the United Kingdom acknowledges that “Ar-
ticle 11, paragraph 1, differs from the other provisions on which Libya
has relied, in that it does impose obligations on other States” and “is thus
capable, in the abstract, of giving rise to a dispute between Libya and the
United Kingdom”. However, it maintains that it did not violate this pro-
vision, and claims in particular that it “provided Libya with copies of the
Scottish charges, the warrant for the arrest of the accused and the State-
ment of Facts prepared by the Lord Advocate”. It also recalls that at the
time when Libya presented its claims, Libya had not — any more than
had the United Kingdom — invoked the Montreal Convention, and it
concluded that,

“For the failure of the United Kingdom to supply further infor-
mation to Libya to constitute a violation of Article 11, the Conven-
tion must at least have been invoked by one of the States con-
cerned.”

32. Article 11 of the Montreal Convention is worded as follows:

“1. Contracting States shall afford one another the greatest mea-
sure of assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought
in respect of the offences. The law of the State requested shall apply
in all cases.

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not affect
obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, which
governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual assistance in
criminal matters.”

33. Having taken account of the positions of the Parties as to the
duties imposed by Article 11 of the Montreal Convention, the Court con-
cludes that there equally exists between them a dispute which concerns
the interpretation and application of that provision, and which, in accor-


23 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

dance with Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention, falls to be decided
by the Court.

+

34. Libya, in the latest version of its submissions, finally asks the
Court to find that

“the United Kingdom is under a legal obligation to respect Libya’s
right not to have the [Montreal] Convention set aside by means
which would in any case be at variance with the principles of the
United Nations Charter and with the mandatory rules of general
international law prohibiting the use of force and the violation of the
sovereignty, territorial integrity, sovereign equality and political inde-
pendence of States”. )

35. The United Kingdom maintains that it is not for the Court, on the
basis of Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Montreal Convention, to decide
on the lawfulness of actions which are in any event in conformity with
international law, and which were instituted by the Respondent to secure
the surrender of the two alleged offenders. It concludes from this that the
Court lacks jurisdiction over the submissions presented on this point by
Libya.

36. The Court cannot uphold the line of argument thus formulated.
Indeed, it is for the Court to decide, on the basis of Article 14, para-
graph 1, of the Montreal Convention, on the lawfulness of the actions
criticized by Libya, in so far as those actions would be at variance with
the provisions of the Montreal Convention.

*

37. In the present case, the United Kingdom has contended, however,
that even if the Montreal Convention did confer on Libya the rights it
claims, they could not be exercised in this case because they were super-
seded by Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) which,
by virtue of Articles 25 and 103 of the United Nations Charter, have pri-
ority over all rights and obligations arising out of the Montreal Conven-
tion. The Respondent has also argued that, because of the adoption of
those resolutions, the only dispute which existed from that point on was
between Libya and the Security Council; this, clearly, would not be a dis-
pute falling within the terms of Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Montreal
Convention and thus not one which the Court could entertain.

38. The Court cannot uphold this line of argument. Security Council
resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) were in fact adopted after the filing
of the Application on 3 March 1992. In accordance with its established
jurisprudence, if the Court had jurisdiction on that date, it continues to
do so; the subsequent coming into existence of the above-mentioned


24 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

resolutions cannot affect its jurisdiction once established (cf. Nottebohm,
Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122; Right of
Passage over Indian Territory, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1957, p. 142).

tion to admissibility derived by the United Kingdom from Security
Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) must be rejected, and that
Libya’s Application is admissible.

x Fox

46. In dealing with admissibility, the Agent of the United Kingdom
also stated that his Government “ask[ed] the Court to rule that the inter-
vening resolutions of the Security Council have rendered the Libyan
claims without object”.

The Court has already acknowledged, on several occasions in the past,
that events subsequent to the filing of an application may “render an
application without object” (Border and Transborder Armed Actions
(Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1988, p. 95, para. 66) and “therefore the Court is not
called upon to give a decision thereon” (Nuclear Tests (Australia
v. France), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 62) (cf. Northern
Cameroons, Judgment, 1. C.J. Reports 1963, p. 38).

In the present case, the United Kingdom puts forward an objection
aimed at obtaining from the Court a decision not to proceed to judgment
on the merits, which objection must be examined within the framework
of this jurisprudence.

47. The Court must satisfy itself that such an objection does indeed
fall within the provisions of Article 79 of the Rules, relied upon by the
Respondent. In paragraph 1, this Article refers to “Any objection . . . to
the jurisdiction of the Court or to the admissibility of the application,
or other objection” (emphasis added); its field of application ratione
materiae is thus not limited solely to objections regarding jurisdiction
or admissibility. However, if it is to be covered by Article 79, an objection
must also possess a “preliminary” character. Paragraph 1 of Article 79 of
. the Rules of Court characterizes as “preliminary” an objection “the deci-
sion upon which is requested before any further proceedings”. There can
be no doubt that the objection envisaged here formally meets this condi-
tion. The Court would also indicate that, in this instance, the Respondent
is advancing the argument that the decisions of the Security Council


27 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

could not form the subject of any contentious proceedings before the
Court, since they allegedly determine the rights which the Applicant
claims to derive from a treaty text, or at least that they directly affect
those rights; and that the Respondent thus aims to preclude at the outset
any consideration by the Court of the claims submitted by the Applicant
and immediately terminate the proceedings brought by it. In so far as the
purpose of the objection raised by the United Kingdom that there is no
ground for proceeding to judgment on the merits is, effectively, to pre-
vent, in limine, any consideration of the case on the merits, so that its
“effect [would] be, if the objection is upheld, to interrupt further proceed-
ings in the case”, and “it [would] therefore be appropriate for the Court
to deal with [it] before enquiring into the merits” (Panevezys-Saldutiskis
Railway, Judgment, 1939, P.C.LJ., Series AIB, No. 76, p. 16), this objec-
tion possesses a preliminary character and does indeed fall within the
provisions of Article 79 of the Rules of Court.

Moreover, it is incontrovertible that the objection concerned was sub-
mitted in writing within the time-limit fixed for the filing of the Counter-
Memorial, and was thus submitted in accordance with the formal condi-
tions laid down in Article 79.

48. Libya does not dispute any of these points. It does not contend
that the objection derived by the United Kingdom from Security Council
resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) is an objection on the merits, which
does not fall within the provisions of Article 79 of the Rules of Court,
nor does it claim that the objection was not properly submitted. What
Libya contends is that this objection falls within the category of those
which paragraph 7 of Article 79 of the Rules of Court characterizes as
objections “not possess[ing], in the circumstances of the case, an exclu-
sively preliminary character” (see paragraph 42 above).

On the contrary, the United Kingdom considers that the objection
concerned possesses an “exclusively preliminary character” within the
meaning of that provision; and, at the hearing, its Agent insisted on the
need for the Court to avoid any proceedings on the merits, which to his
mind were not only “likely to be lengthy and costly” but also, by virtue of
the difficulty that “the handling of evidentiary material . . . might raise
serious problems”.

Thus it is on the question of the “exclusively” or “non-exclusively” pre-
liminary character of the objection here considered that the Parties are
divided and on which the Court must now make a determination.

49. The present wording of Article 79, paragraph 7, of the Rules of
Court was adopted by the Court in 1972. The Court has had occasion to
examine its precise scope and significance in the Judgments it delivered in
the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against
Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), on 26 November
1984 (Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1984,
pp. 425-426) and on 26 June 1986 (Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1986, pp. 29-31), respectively. As the Court pointed out in the second of
those Judgments,




“Under the Rules of Court dating back to 1936 (which on this
point reflected still earlier practice), the Court had the power to join
an objection to the merits ‘whenever the interests of the good admin-
istration of justice require it’ (Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway,
P.C.IJ., Series AIB, No. 75, p. 56), and in particular where the
Court, if it were to decide on the objection, ‘would run the risk of
adjudicating on questions which appertain to the merits of the case
or of prejudging their solution’ (ibid. ).” (I. C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 29-
30, para. 39.)

However, the exercise of that power carried a risk,

“namely that the Court would ultimately decide the case on the
preliminary objection, after requiring the parties to fully plead the
merits, — and this did in fact occur (Barcelona Traction, Light
and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, I.C.J. Reports 1970,
p. 3). The result was regarded in some quarters as an unnecessary pro-
longation of an expensive and time-consuming procedure.” ([ibid.,
p. 30, para. 39.)

The Court was then faced with the following choice:

“to revise the Rules so as to exclude for the future the possibility of
joinder to the merits, so that every objection would have to be
resolved at the preliminary stage, or to seek a solution which would
be more flexible” (ibid., p. 30, para. 40).

The solution adopted in 1972 was ultimately not to exclude the power

to examine a preliminary objection in the merits phase, but to limit the
exercise of that power, by laying down the conditions more strictly. The
Court concluded, in relation to the new provision thus adopted:

“It thus presents one clear advantage: that it qualifies certain
objections as preliminary, making it quite clear that when they are
exclusively of that character they will have to be decided upon
immediately, but if they are not, especially when the character of the
objections is not exclusively preliminary because they contain both
preliminary aspects and other aspects relating to the merits, they will
have to be dealt with at the stage of the merits. This approach also
tends to discourage the unnecessary prolongation of proceedings at
the jurisdictional stage.” (Ibid., p. 31, para. 41.)

50. The Court must therefore ascertain whether, in the present case,

the United Kingdom’s objection based on the Security Council decisions
contains “both preliminary aspects and other aspects relating to the mer-
its” or not.

That objection relates to many aspects of the dispute. By maintaining

that Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) have ren-
dered the Libyan claims without object, the United Kingdom seeks to
obtain from the Court a decision not to proceed to judgment on the


29 1971 MONTREAL CONVENTION (JUDGMENT)

merits, which would immediately terminate the proceedings. However, by
requesting such a decision, the United Kingdom is requesting, in reality,
at least two others which the decision not to proceed to judgment on the
merits would necessarily postulate: on the one hand a decision establish-
ing that the rights claimed by Libya under the Montreal Convention are
incompatible with its obligations under the Security Council resolutions;
and, on the other hand, a decision that those obligations prevail over
those rights by virtue of Articles 25 and 103 of the Charter.

The Court therefore has no doubt that Libya’s rights on the merits
would not only be affected by a decision, at this stage of the proceedings,
not to proceed to judgment on the merits, but would constitute, in many
respects, the very subject-matter of that decision. The objection raised by
the United Kingdom on that point has the character of a defence on the
merits. In the view of the Court, this objection does much more than
“touch[ing] upon subjects belonging to the merits of the case” (Certain
German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 6,
1925, P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 6, p. 15); it is “inextricably interwoven”
with the merits (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited,
Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1964, p. 46).

The Court notes furthermore that the United Kingdom itself broached
many substantive problems in its written and oral pleadings in this phase,
and pointed out that those problems had been the subject of exhaustive
exchanges before the Court; the United Kingdom Government thus
implicitly acknowledged that the objection raised and the merits of the
case were “closely interconnected” (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
1964, p. 46, and the reference to Pajzs, Csäky, Esterhdzy, Order of
23 May 1936, P.C.LJ., Series AIB, No. 66, p. 9).

If the Court were to rule on that objection, it would therefore inevi-
tably be ruling on the merits; in relying on the provisions of Article 79
of the Rules of Court, the Respondent has set in motion a procedure
the precise aim of which is to prevent the Court from so doing.

The Court concludes from the foregoing that the objection of the
United Kingdom according to which the Libyan claims have been ren-
dered without object does not have “an exclusively preliminary charac-
ter” within the meaning of that Article.
