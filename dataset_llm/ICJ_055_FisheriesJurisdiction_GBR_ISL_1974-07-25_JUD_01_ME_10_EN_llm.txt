1. Although I agree that the Regulations concerning the Fishery
Limits off Iceland (Reglugerd um fiskveiSilandhelgi Islands) promulgated
by the Government of Iceland on 14 July 1972, and constituting a uni-
lateral extension of the exclusive fishing rights of Iceland to 50 nautical
miles from the baselines specified therein are not opposable to the
Government of the United Kingdom; and, although I agree also that, in
consequence, the Government of Iceland is not entitled unilaterally to
exclude United Kingdom fishing vessels from areas to seaward of the
fishery limits agreed to in the Exchange of Notes of 11 March 1961 or
unilaterally to impose restrictions on the activities of those vessels in
such areas, my reasons for reaching these conclusions are so fundamen-
tally different from those of the Court that F feel unable to vote for the
first part of the operative clause of the Judgment for the reasons given
by the Court. For the rest of the Judgment, it is my view that the Court
settled an issue on which the Parties were not in dispute. In my view the
Court’s approach to the entire case has led it to refrain from deciding the
sole dispute before it, and to consider and settle an issue on which the
Parties were not shown to be in difference and on which the Court’s
jurisdiction is very much in doubt.

2. At the jurisdiction phase of the present case !, the Court said:

“The present case concerns a dispute between the Government of
the United Kingdom and the Government of Iceland occasioned by
the claim of the latter fo extend its exclusive fisheries jurisdiction to a
zone of 50 nautical miles around Iceland.” (I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 7,
para. 11.) (Emphasis added.)

3. The question which arises in the present case is what is the dispute
between the Parties which has been submitted to the Court and which the
Court decided on 2 February 1973 it has jurisdiction to entertain? It
seems to me that the answer to this question is to be found in the discus-
sions between the Parties preceding the Exchange of Notes of 1961, the
Exchange of Notes itself, the subsequent communications between the
Parties and the various enactments of the Parliament of Iceland. An
examination of these materials appears to me to show that the dispute
between the Parties in the case in hand is about the unilateral extension
of Iceland’s exclusive fisheries jurisdiction beyond the 12 miles around
Iceland agreed in the Exchange of Notes of 1961.

4. The negotiations conducted between the United Kingdom and
Iceland which resulted in the Exchange of Notes of 1961 were necessitated
by a desire on both sides to seek adjustment of the differences between
them over the proposed extension by Iceland of her fishery jurisdiction
round her coast from 4 miles to 12 miles after the conclusion of the
United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958. The United
Kingdom opposed this proposed extension on the ground that it had no
basis in international law, but with the emergence of a general trend
towards accepting a 12-mile limit of fishery jurisdiction after the Geneva
Conference on the Law of the Sea it was possible for the Parties to reach
the agreement constituted by the Exchange of Notes of 1961.

The record of the discussions during these negotiations is illuminating;
it shows clearly what the dispute between the Parties was about, and what
it was the United Kingdom was anxious to guard against by the com-
promissory clause of the Exchange of Notes on which it had insisted
during the negotiations.

5. This record shows that at the first meeting on 1 October 1960,
between the Icelandic delegation and the United Kingdom delegation,
the leader of the Icelandic delegation in stating the views of the Icelandic
Government made the points:

“(a) Iceland is in a unique position in that its people are dependent
entirely upon the coastal fisheries; this is universally recog-
nized;

(b) it is therefore essential for the Icelandic Government to safe-
guard its coastal fishery resources: conservation measures
applicable to all alike were not sufficient for this. It is, therefore,
the policy of the Icelandic Government to secure exclusive
fishery jurisdiction ‘in accordance with international law’. The



International Law Commission of the United Nations had, in
1956, drawn attention to countries which found themselves in
this special position.” (Emphasis added.)

The Icelandic delegation made it clear that future extensions of exclusive
fisheries jurisdiction could not be ruled out, and paragraph VIII of the
Icelandic Memorandum handed to the United Kingdom delegation
stated:

“The Icelandic Government reserves its right to extend fisheries
jurisdiction in Icelandic waters in conformity with international law.
Such extension would, however, be based either on an agreement
(bilateral or multilateral) or decisions of the Icelandic Government
which would be subject to arbitration at the request of appropriate
parties.”

6. Throughout these negotiations the question of Iceland’s preferential
rights or of conservation was not discussed, although the United King-
dom delegation, on a number of occasions, suggested that it might
consider restrictions on fishing by the United Kingdom outside the 12-
mile zone during the phasing-out period yet to be agreed on, if such
restrictions were shown to be necessary in the interests of conservation.
The Icelandic delegation did not take up these suggestions, and left no
doubt that outside the 12-mile zone its long-term aim remained the
extension of Iceland’s exclusive fishery jurisdiction. The Records of
Anglo-Icelandic Discussions of 1 November 1960 bring this out clearly as
the following extract from page 33 shows:

“Sir Patrick Reilly then turned to the question of the assurance
to be given by the Icelandic Government. He asked Miss Gutteridge
to explain the British position on this. Miss Gutteridge said we were
glad to know that an assurance was considered possible on the Ice-
landic side. We could not of course oppose any further extension of
limits made by Iceland in accordance with international law. At the
same time we held that extensions could only be by agreement and
could not be unilateral even if a coastal State offered arbitration. For
this reason we could not accept the last sentence in the text for the
assurance proposed by the Icelandic Government. While in Reyk-
javik the British Delegation had worked out a formula which seemed
to provide a possible basis agreeable to both sides and suggested that
this formula should now be discussed. Miss Gutteridge handed over
a copy of the following proposed text:

‘Except in accordance with the terms of any subsequent agree-
ment between the United Kingdom and Iceland or any subsequent



multilateral agreement which embodies a generally accepted rule

of law in relation to fishing limits, the Icelandic Government will

not take any action to exclude vessels registered in the territory of
the United Kingdom from fishing in any area outside the 12-mile
limit.”

After studying the text Mr. Andersen said that it was necessary for
the purpose of presentation to public opinion in Iceland to leave the
Icelandic Government's hands ‘untied’ in respect of possible further
extensions of fishery jurisdiction. The Icelandic Government would
the_efore as a minimum want to cover in the wording of the assur-
ance the possibility of applying customary law, as well as interna-
tional law. Opinion in the world was always changing and Iceland
would want to take advantage of that if it were favourable without
waiting for changes in international law which always seemed diffi-
cult to achieve (e.g., the two Geneva Conferences).”

7. The history and nature of the dispute which was then being settled
leave no doubt in my mind that the assurance then demanded by the
United Kingdom, and subsequently given by Iceland about future
extensions, could not be anything else but an assurance that Iceland
would not, in the future, seek to extend her exclusive fishery jurisdiction
beyond the 12-mile limit as she was then seeking to do from 4 miles to 12
miles except in accordance with the terms of the assurance.

8. The Icelandic delegation had left no-one in any doubt that the
exclusive fishery jurisdiction over the 12-mile zone, which was then
conceded, was only a first step towards ultimate extension of fishery
jurisdiction over the entire continental shelf of Iceland. At a meeting in
Reykjavik between the two delegations on 2 December 1960, the Foreign
Minister of Iceland said that the aim of the Icelandic Government was the
continental shelf; they were, however, ready to state their intention to
base their action on rules of international law and also their willingness
to submit any dispute to the International Court.

9. In these negotiations preceding the Exchange of Notes, no mention
was made of the need for conservation of the fish-stocks around Iceland
nor of Iceland’s preferential rights as matters on which either of the
parties required assurances then or thereafter. These matters were not
discussed at all as they were not the problems created by the proposed
extension of Iceland's exclusive fishery jurisdiction from 4 miles to 12
miles in 1958.

10. In the light of the foregoing, it seems to me that what the United
Kingdom and Iceland had in mind when they agreed in the Exchange of
Notes of 11 March 1961 that “in case of a dispute in relation to such



FISHERIES JURISDICTION (Diss. OP. ONYEAMA)

extension, the matter shall, at the request of either party, be referred to
the International Court of Justice” was a dispute in relation to the uni-
lateral extension of fishery jurisdiction by Iceland beyond the limit then
agreed. It was precisely such a dispute which arose following a statement

14. In the jurisdiction phase of the present case, the Court considered
what the issue before it was, and said :

“Account must also be taken of the fact that the Applicant has
contended before the Court that to the extent that Iceland may, as
a coastal State specially dependent on coastal fisheries for its liveli-
hood or economic development, assert a need to procure the establish-
ment of a special fisheries conservation régime (including such a
régime under which it enjoys preferential rights) in the waters
adjacent to its coast but beyond the exclusive fisheries zone provided
for by the 1961 Exchange of Notes, it can legitimately pursue that
objective by collaboration and agreement with the other countries
concerned, but not by the unilateral arrogation of exclusive rights
within those waters. The exceptional dependence of Iceland on its
fisheries and the principle of conservation of fish stocks having been
recognized, the question remains as to whether Iceland is or is not
competent unilaterally to assert an exclusive fisheries jurisdiction
extending beyond the 12-mile limit. The issue before the Court in the
present phase of the proceedings concerns solely its jurisdiction to
determine the latter point.” (Emphasis added.) (1.C.J. Reports 1973,
p. 20, para. 42.)

This “latter point” was covered in the first submission of the United
Kingdom in its Application.

15. Regarding the second submission in the Application the Court,
in the jurisdiction phase, dealt with it in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the
Judgment. Paragraph 41 is as follows:

“ft should be observed in this connection that the exceptional
dependence of Iceland on its fisheries for its subsistence and economic
development is expressly recognized in the 1961 Exchange of Notes,
and the Court, in its Order of 17 August 1972, stated that ‘it is also
necessary to bear in mind the exceptional dependence of the Icelandic
nation upon coastal fisheries for its livelihood and economic develop-
ment as expressly recognized by the United Kingdom in its Note
addressed to the Foreign Minister of Iceland dated 11 March 1961°.
The Court further stated that ‘from this point of view account must
be taken of the need for the conservation of fish stocks in the Iceland
area’. (I.C.J. Reports 1972, pp. 16 and 17.) “This point is not
disputed.” (/.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 20, para. 41.)



It is to be noted with reference to this second submission, which is repeated
in more elaborate form in the Memorial and in the submissions at the
end of the oral proceedings, that it is hypothetical, and based on the
assumption that Iceland, as a coastal State in a special situation, raises
questions concerning conservation of fish stocks and preferential rights;
but Iceland has not raised these questions in any of the negotiations or
in any of the documents it saw fit to transmit to the Court. I understand
the statements of the Court cited above to mean that the exceptional
dependence of Iceland on its fisheries for its subsistence and economic
development, and the principle of conservation (including a conservation
régime under which Iceland enjoys preferential rights) were recognized by
the United Kingdom, and were, therefore, not in issue. The issue before
the Court was whether it had jurisdiction to determine whether Iceland
was competent unilaterally to assert an exclusive fisheries jurisdiction
extending beyond the 12-mile limit. It was on this dispute, about the
validity of the extension, that the Court decided it had jurisdiction.

16. In the forefront of the submissions of the United Kingdom in the
Application and in the Memorial on the merits was a request for a
decision by the Court that there is no foundation in international law
for the claim by Iceland to be entitled to extend its fisheries jurisdiction
by establishing a zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction extending to 50
nautical miles. This, it seems to me, was the gravamen of the dispute, but
the Court now declines to decide it. The decision appears to approach the
dispute, not from the point of view of the conflict of the extension with
any conventions or with customary international law, but from the point
of view that the extension was an exercise of preferential rights which did
not give due regard to established rights. This was not the dispute between
the Parties and it forms no part of the claim made by Iceland.

17. T am of the opinion that Article 2 of the High Seas Convention
and Article 3 of the Continental Shelf Convention! provide a basis in
positive international law for deciding that the extension has no basis in
international law; and the Court, having found that the concept of the
fishery zone, and the extension of that fishery zone up to a 12-mile limit
from baselines, appear now to be generally accepted 2 as customary
international law, should have drawn the conclusion that the unilateral
extension to a 50-mile limit by Iceland with which this case is concerned
is contrary to international law, and stated that conclusion in the oper-
ative clause of the Judgment.

By introducing the concept of preferential rights into the case and
linking its Judgment 3 with this concept, the Court, in my view, took

! “The coastal State has no jurisdiction over the superjacent waters” [of the continen-
tal shelf] (1.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 37, para. 59).

London on 9 May 1973. On the question of the activation of Article 7
(2) 3 of the Convention 4 the Summary Record of the Second Session has

of the Delegations present and voting and subsequently accepted by all Contracting
States in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures.”

countries within the limits the Icelandic Government had recon-
sidered the position and had decided to postpone the activation of
Article 7 (2). In reply to a question from the President, the Icelandic
delegate said he was unable to say when his Government would
ratify Article 7 (2) powers. The Icelandic Government believed that
coastal States had prime responsibility to manage and prior rights to
use marine resources off their coasts. Catch quotas appeared to
conflict with these rights and the problem would be raised at next
year’s Law of the Sea Conference which was the only forum for
discussion of it. It would be very difficult for Iceland to accept a
catch quota system which did not harmonize with its policy in
regard to fishery limits.” (Emphasis added.)

21. Iceland has not, so far as I can see, asserted any claim to preferen-
tial rights in the area in question; on the other hand, the United Kingdom
has always stood ready to concede such rights if they were asserted on
conservation grounds and in circumstances of catch-limitations. It does
not appear to me to be possible to have a dispute where there is no
difference on a common issue between the parties, or where a right is
conceded. The Permanent Court of International Justice defines a dispute
as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of
interests between two persons !”. As I understand it, for a dispute to
exist, it should clearly appear that the claim of one party is positively
opposed by the other, and it is not sufficient merely for it to appear that
the interests of the two parties are in conflict.

23. The Court derives its jurisdiction in this case from the compromis-
sory clause of the Exchange of Notes of 1961. I think the words “in
relation to such extension” in that clause cannot reasonably be interpreted
as including disputes about conservation, catch-limitations and prefer-
ential rights (which are not susceptible of unilateral delimitation) within
the range of disputes the Parties agreed to refer to the Court; and in
deciding that the Parties were obliged to negotiate these matters, the
Court, to my mind, exceeded the jurisdiction conferred on it by the
Exchange of Notes and settled a non-existent dispute.
