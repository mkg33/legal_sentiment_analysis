question of the existence of their legal right or interest. This matter
again, at this stage of the proceedings, has been taken up by the Court
and examined, but from the viewpoint of the merits.

Here, attention must be drawn to the Court’s characterization of
the question of the Applicants’ legal interest, namely its statement
that ‘there was one matter that appertained to the merits of the case
but which had an antecedent character, namely the question of the
Applicants’ standing in the present phase of the proceedings ... the
question .. . of their legal right or interest regarding the subject-matter
of their claim, as set out in their final submissions”.

The result is that the Applicants’ claims are declared to be rejected
on the ground of the lack of any legal right or interest appertaining to
them in the subject-matter of the present claims and that the 1962
Judgment is substantively overruled concerning its decision on the third
preliminary objection.

Although we do not deny the power of the Court to re-examine
jurisdictional and other preliminary matters at any stage of proceedings
proprio motu, we consider that there are not sufficient reasons to overrule
on this point the 1962 Judgment and that the Court should proceed to
decide the questions of the “ultimate” merits which have arisen from
the Applicants’ final submissions.

We are again confronted with the question whether the Applicants
possess a legal right or interest in the proper discharge by the Respondent,
as the Mandatory, of the obligations incumbent upon it by virtue of
the “conduct clauses” in the mandate agreement.


A negative conclusion is derived either from the nature of the interest,
or from the capacity of the Applicants.

The interests which may be possessed by the member States of the
League in connection with the mandates system, are usually classified in
two categories. The first one is the so-called national interest which
includes both the interest of the member States as States and the interest
of their nationals (Article 5 of the Mandate). The second one is the
common or general interest, which the member States possess in the
proper performance by the mandatory of the mandate obligations.

Whether the adjudication clause, namely Article 7, paragraph 2, of
the Mandate can cover both kinds of interests, or only the first one,
namely national interest, is the question that has to be answered in
the present cases.

The historical development of law demonstrates the continual process
of the cultural enrichment of the legal order by taking into consideration
values or interests which had previously been excluded from the sphere
of law. In particular, the extension of the object of rights to cultural,
and therefore intangible, matters and the legalization of social justice
and of humanitarian ideas which cannot be separated from the gradual
realization of world peace, are worthy of our attention.

The fact that international law has long recognized that States may
have legal interests in matters which do not affect their financial, eco-
nomic, or other “material” or so-called “physical” or “tangible” interests
was exhaustively pointed out by Judge Jessup in his separate opinion
in the South West Africa cases, 1962 Judgment (I.C.J. Reports 1962,
pp. 425-428). As outstanding examples of the recognition of the legal
interests of States in general humanitarian causes, the international efforts
to suppress the slave trade, the minorities treaties, the Genocide Con-
vention and the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation
are cited.

The question is whether under Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate,
the Applicants possess a right to have recourse to the Court by reason
of a violation by the Respondent of certain conduct clauses provided by
the Mandate, namely whether the Applicants have a legal interest in
invoking the Court’s jurisdiction concerning the obligations imposed
on the Respondent by the conduct clauses.

One of the arguments in denial of the Applicants’ legal interest in
the Respondent’s observance of the conduct clauses is that the Applicants
do not suffer any injuries from non-observance of the conduct clauses.
The Applicants, however, may not suffer any injuries in the sense that
their own State interests or the interests of their nationals are injured.
The injuries need not be physical and material, but may be psychological
and immaterial, and this latter kind of injuries may exist for the Appli-
cants in the case of non-observance by the Respondent of the conduct
clauses.

The supreme objectives of the mandates system, namely the promotion
of the well-being and social progress of the inhabitants of the Territory
mentioned in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate, in spite of their
highly abstract nature, cannot be denied the nature of a legal interest
in which all Members of the League participate.

In the field of corporation law, such phenomena are highly developed.
In some countries we find the institution of a representative suit by
a shareholder against the administration. Each shareholder not only
possesses individual rights in respect of dividends and rights to participate
in the assembly and to vote, but can behave independently of the ad-
ministration and of the assembly in bringing a law suit on behalf of
the corporation. In this case, in the position of a shareholder, the
corporate and individual elements are intermingled. As a result, even
if a Member of the League has a right to have recourse to the Inter-
national Court by virtue of Article 7, paragraph 2, on the ground of
non-compliance by the Mandatory with the obligations of Article 2,
paragraph 2, of the Mandate, it cannot be considered as unjuristic.
In the present cases, the Applicants appear formally in an individual
capacity as Members of the League, but they are acting substantially
in a representative capacity. That not only the Council, but the Member
States of the League are equally interested in the proper administration
of the mandated territory, is quite natural and significant. In this respect,
the individual Member States of the League penetrate the corporate veil
of the League and function independently of the League.

There are two main reasonings upon which the Court’s denial of
the Applicants’ legal right now appears to be based. The one is the
juridical character and structure of the institution, the League of Nations,
within the framework of which the mandates system is both created
and enshrined. The League functions “through the instrumentality of
an Assembly and a Council” and “no role was reserved either by the

LE

Covenant or the mandate instruments to individual members ...”.

We cannot deny that the League and the mandates system possess
such structure that the member States as individuals are fundamentally
excluded from participation in the functioning of the League and the
mandates system and that rights cannot be derived from the mere fact
of membership of the organization in itself. The question remains as



to whether the corporate structure of the League excludes the possibility
that the mandate instrument may confer upon the individual member
States the right to have recourse to the International Court on matters
concerning the “conduct” clause. The answer depends upon the inter-
pretation of Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate.

The other reasoning is, that, in the Court’s opinion, the Applicants
do not possess a legal right directly or by a clearly necessary implication,
through a substantive and not merely adjectival provision of the Mandate
in the same way as they possess it by virtue of Article 5 of the Mandate
which is concerned with the so-called “national rights” of the Member
States. But in this case, whether a substantive right is conferred on
member States by that provision or not, is highly doubtful.

Accordingly, the distinction between the “conduct” clause and the
“national” clause is not an essential one. The latter must be considered
as an integral part of the Mandatory’s obligations which are derived
from the objectives of the mandates system, namely the promotion of
material and moral well-being and social progress. Whether some of
the obligations are related to the interest of some of the member States
of the League or not, is quite immaterial to the nature of Article 5 of
the Mandate. -

Therefore the classification of the mandate provisions into two
categories, namely the conduct clause and the national clause is of
secondary importance.

be found, not in the jurisdictional, adjectival provision but in the sub-
stantive provision, we feel we should point out that in the Mandate the
substantive and procedural elements are inseparably intermingled and
that Article 7, paragraph 2, can confer substantive rights on the indi-
vidual member States of the League. This conclusion must be justified,
if we approve the above-mentioned viewpoint that Article 5 of the
Mandate does not confer upon the member States of the League any
substantive right. The source of their right cannot be sought elsewhere
than in Article 7, paragraph 2, in connection with other provisions of
the Mandate.

In this connection, we cannot overlook the dissenting opinions of
Judges de Bustamante and Oda appended to the Judgment of the
Mavrommatis Concessions case. Both emphasize what they consider as
essential in the compromissory clause. Judge de Bustamante says:

“As the latter [the League of Nations] could not appear as a
party to a dispute concerning the application or interpretation of
the Mandate, having regard to the restrictive terms of Article 34
of the Court’s Statute, it is the Members of the League who have
been authorized, in their capacity as Members, to bring before the
Court questions regarding the interpretation or application of the
Mandate.” (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 81.)

“Whenever Great Britain as Mandatory performs in Palestine
under the Mandate acts of a general nature affecting the public
interest, the Members of the League—from which she holds the
Mandate—are entitled, provided that all other conditions are
fulfilled, to have recourse to the Permanent Court. On the other
hand, when Great Britain takes action affecting private interests
and in respect of individuals and private companies in her capacity
as the Administration of Palestine, there is no question of juridical
relations between the Mandatory and the Members of the League
from which she holds the Mandate, but of legal relations between
third parties who have nothing to do with the Mandate itself from
the standpoint of public law.” (Zbid., pp. 81-82.)

Next, Judge Oda, pursuing the same idea more clearly, says:

“Since the Mandate establishes a special legal relationship, it is
natural that the League of Nations, which issued the Mandate,
should have rights of supervision as regards the Mandatory. Under
the Mandate, in addition to the direct supervision of the Council
of the League of Nations (Articles 24 and 25) provision is made
for indirect supervision by the Court; but the latter may only be
exercised at the request of a Member of the League of Nations
(Article 26). It is therefore to be supposed that an application by
such a Member must be made exclusively with a view to the pro-
tection of general interests and that it is not admissible for a State



simply to substitute itself for a private person in order to assert
his private claims.” (Zbid., p. 86).

The dispute within the meaning of Article 7, paragraph 2, must be
one which cannot be settled by negotiation.

Well, in the present cases, the dispute in which the interest is incorpo-
rated is of a humanitarian character which does not appear to be com-
patible with the possibility of settlement by negotiation. It will furnish
a strong reason to support the argument denying the admissibility of
the claim in the present cases, because the law suit is in some sense an
act of disposal of interest and, in this case, the dispute is mainly concerned
with fundamental human rights which are called inalienable.

The joint dissenting opinion (ibid., p. 551), denies the possibility of
settlement of the dispute by negotiation inter se—namely between the
Applicant and Respondent States. The reason seems to be based, on the
one hand on the nature of the dispute which does not relate to their
own State interests or those of their nationals, but belongs to the
“conduct of the Mandate’ type—the “sacred trust”; on the other hand,
on the incapability of any settlement negotiated between single States,
such as the Applicant States and the Mandatory.

The inherent incapability of settlement of subject-matter such as
the sacred trust, to be settled by negotiation, however, does not exclude
the possibility of compromise concerning detailed policies and measures
in order to implement the fundamental principles of the Mandate.
Implementation is essentially a matter of degree and is therefore sus-
ceptible of compromise. Accordingly, we cannot consider that the
nature of a dispute which is concerned with the sacred trust is incom-
patible with settlement by negotiation.

The question of competence to settle by negotiation must be decided
from the point of view that the Applicants as Members of the League
individually and at the same time as its organ possess a legal interest
in the realization of the sacred trust and therefore competence to settle
the dispute by negotiation.

It may reasonably be feared that, if each individual Member of the
League possesses a right to institute proceedings against the Mandatory
by reason of non-compliance with the conduct clauses, repetitious
suits against the Mandatory would arise, procedural chaos would
prevail and the legal situation of the Mandatory would be highly pre-
carious.

In circumstances in which the binding power, erga omnes effect,
of a decision of this category is lacking, one is obliged to rely solely
upon the possibility of intervention (Articles 62, 63 of the Statute),
the wisdom of the Court and the common-sense of those concerned
until legislative arrangement and adjustment will be made to attain
uniformity of decision. These possible abnormalities, arising from the
defect of the machinery, however, should not be a reason for denying
a right to have recourse to the International Court by reason of non-
compliance by the Mandatory of the conduct clauses of the Mandate.

As we have seen above, the interests involved in the mandates system
are multiple. The Applicants in their capacity as Members of the
League possess a legal interest in compliance by the Respondent with
the obligations imposed by the conduct clauses of the Mandate. The
Applicants, on the other side, can have individual interests which
are classified in two categories: on the one hand, State interests and on
the other, the interests of their own nationals. Although these interests
may exist in connection with the administration of the Mandate, they
are only incidental to the mandates system. Far more important are
the general interests which are inherent in the Mandate itself and which
cannot be ignored in the interpretation of the compromissory clause
in the Mandate.

we are confronted with a preliminary question concerning the res
judicata which shall be recognized or denied to the Court’s foregoing
decisions on identical matters.

The first question which we must decide at the stage of the merits,
is the question of the existence or otherwise of the Mandate after the
dissolution of the League. This question is, without doubt, the core
of the present cases in the sense that whole obligations and rights of
the Respondent as Mandatory depend on the solution of this question.

This question has been envisaged by the Court twice. The Advisory
Opinion of 11 July 1950 denied the annihilative effect of the dissolution
of the League and recognized the continuance of the obligations of the



Respondent under the Mandate. Next, in the preliminary objections
stage of the present cases the Respondent’s first preliminary objection
was the denial to the Mandate of the character of “a treaty or convention
in force” within the meaning of Article 37 of the Statute, an argument
based on the doctrine of the lapse of the Mandate automatically caused
by the dissolution of the League. This objection, however, was dismissed
by the Judgment of 1962.


“Opinions are not formally binding on States nor on the organ
which requests them, they do not have the authority of res judicata;
but the Court must, in view of its high mission, attribute to them
great legal value and a moral authority.” (Interpretation of Peace
Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, Advisory Opinion,
I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 91.)

Next, the decision of 1962 needs to be considered.

It may be thought that the Court’s finding in the 1962 Judgment
in favour of the survival of the Mandate would have the force of res
judicata (Article 59 of the Statute), but that the effect of res judicata
of this Judgment should be limited to the operative part of the Judgment
and not extend to the reasons underlying it.

The effect of res judicata concerning a judgment on jurisdictional
matters must be confined to the point of the existence or otherwise
of the Court’s jurisdiction. In case of an affirmative decision, the only
effect is that the Court shall proceed to examine the question of the
merits. To the preliminary stage must not be attached more meaning
than this.

Briefly, the legal issues of the present cases are centred in the final
analysis on the question of compliance or otherwise by the Respondent
as Mandatory with the obligations declared in Article 2, paragraph 2,
of the Mandate for the Territory of South West Africa, which is nothing
else but the concrete application to this Territory of the principle enunci-
ated in Article 22, paragraph 1, of the Covenant concerning the mandates
system in general.

Before examining the Applicants’ Submissions Nos. 3 and 4 in detail,
we must envisage the question of the justiciability raised by the Respon-
dent of the dispute of the present cases. If the dispute of these cases is
political, administrative, technical or otherwise in character, and not of
legal character, the Court will have no power to exercise its jurisdiction
over it.

Regarding this matter, it must be recalled that the contention of the
political character of the dispute was not raised by the Respondent to
the Court at the stage of the preliminary objection proceedings and that
it was made later during the first stage of the oral proceedings by counsel
for the Respondent (C.R. 65/18, pp. 6 f£.). It is to be noted that this
contention is related only to the general obligations incumbent upon the
Respondent by Article 2, paragraph 2, and Article 22 of the Covenant
as Mandatory and not to specific obligations provided for in Articles 3,
4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Mandate. Accordingly, the arguments between the
Parties concerning the justiciability of the dispute of the present cases
have particular significance only in relation to the Applicants’ Sub-
missions Nos. 3 and 4 which are concerned with the general principles
and objectives of the mandates system.



The Mandate cannot be conceived as divorced from political, ad-
ministrative, economic, technical and cultural factors and as a result
this consideration makes the question of justiciability more complicated.

The Respondent denies the justiciability of matters pertaining to
Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Mandate. The reason thereof is found
in the nature of the power of the Mandatory which is political and
technical, therefore wide, general and, accordingly, discretionary.

The objectives of the mandates system are declared to be “the well-
being and development” of such peoples, namely “peoples not yet able to
stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world”.

The “well-being and development” mean “the material and moral
well-being and the social progress”. (Article 2, paragraph 2, of the
Mandate.) That these objectives form a “sacred trust of civilization”
and “that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied
in this Covenant”, is the principle which should be applied to the colonies
and territories under the mandates system. The securities for the per-
formance of the trust are provided in the Covenant as well as in the
individual mandate instruments, but the objectives of the mandates
system are broad, abstract and comprehensive as is shown by the use
of words such as “well-being”, “development” and “progress”.

Strictly speaking, these concepts having the character of a value
judgment are susceptible of taking different contents according to various
philosophical, theological, political systems and ways of thinking, and
consequently it may be extremely difficult for everybody to agree on
what is meant or implied by these terms, and on the degree of importance
which should be attached to a value in the whole hierarchy of values.
What is meant by well-being or progress? Which one has priority in case
of conflict between material and moral well-being? Is there any difference
between ‘“‘progress” and “development”? Concerning the latter two
concepts there may be great divergence of standpoints between evolution-
ists or pragmatists and conservatives. Concerning the appreciation of
the moral well-being and what it consists of idealists and materialists
may differ one from the other.

The creators of Article 22 and the drafters of the Mandate agreement,
however, do not appear to have scrutinized these matters from the above-
mentioned point of view. They wanted to indicate by this simple formula
the goal of good government as it should be applied to the administration
of mandated territories. They wanted to find some idea or principle which
could be considered a common denominator among divergent political
ideas and thoughts on good government just as it is inevitable in the
case of indicating a constitutional aim of a democratic State or, in an
analogous case, of an international organization whose purposes are
as general as those of the League of Nations or the United Nations.

Let us suppose that the legislators of a certain political community


succeeded in finding a constitutional formula which the majority of its
members could agree to adopt. Still one cannot be optimistic about
its interpretation. Everyone would interpret it according to his own
philosophical or political viewpoint; each would attach a different
meaning to the same slogan. The necessary conclusion would be sub-
jectivism, relativism and anarchism in the interpretation and multiplicity
of political parties in a democratic society.

The fact that, in most cases, political communities under abstract
principles which would indicate general orientation to the politics and
administration, stand, survive, maintain and even prosper, is not attri-
butable to the legislative technique or the manner in which the objectives
of the communities in their constitutions are expressed, but, in final
instance, to the common-sense and political wisdom of the leaders and
constituents of the respective communities.

From what has been mentioned above, we are inclined to conclude
that the concept of the promotion of “material and moral well-being
and social progress of the inhabitants” which constitutes the objectives
of the Mandate for South West Africa (Article 2, paragraph 2), is in
itself of political character and cannot be recognized as susceptible of
judicial determination and execution.

By saying so we do not assert that Article 2, paragraph 2, of the
Mandate does not possess the character of a legal norm. Legislators can
adopt in the system of legal norms other cultural norms, which are
socially relevant, namely moral, political, economic, technical norms,
etc., as distinct from the juridical value judgment. In such cases, a
cultural norm quite heterogeneous in character to legal norm, e.g., in
the control of traffic or architecture, is incorporated in the system of
law. In such cases, we may say that a technique is vested with juridical
value, or that a technique is “naturalized” in the system of law.

Such “naturalization” between legal and other cultural norms occurs
most frequently between law on the one hand and morals and politics
on the, other. The article with which we are now confronted is one of the
typical examples of such “naturalization”.

The promotion of the material and moral well-being and the social
progress of the inhabitants, are the ultimate objectives which the Manda-
tory is obliged to realize. These objectives are essentially of a political
nature, but moral and humanitarian as well. In this case the political
and moral obligations of the Mandatory, as an effect of the mandate
agreement, are incorporated into the law.

The obligations incumbent upon the Respondent as Mandatory are
different from its specific duties enumerated in the Covenant and mandate
agreement and, clearly defined from the viewpoint of their content,
present themselves as the supreme goal of the mandates system which
is of political character. These obligations are therefore general, vague
and abstract, and, accordingly, they are not susceptible of judicial
execution, in spite of the fact that we cannot deny the legal character of
the mandate agreement in its entirety.



This is a reason why, even in countries where the institution of consti-
tutional judicial review is adopted, some of the higher principles of
the constitution are by doctrine and practice excluded from the function
of courts of law. The execution of some constitutional provisions is not
guaranteed as in the case of lex imperfecta.

This is a consequence of the essential difference between law and
politics or administration.

The essential difference between law and politics or administration
lies in the fact that law distinguishes in a categorical way what is right
and just from what is wrong and unjust, while politics and administration,
being the means to attain specific purposes, and dominated by consider-
ations of expediency, make a distinction between the practical and the
unpractical, the efficient and the inefficient. Consequently, in the judg-
ment of law there is no possibility apart from what is just or unjust
(tertium non datur), in the case of politics and administration there are
many possibilities of choice from the viewpoint of expediency and
efficiency. Politics are susceptible of gradation, in contrast to law which
is categorical and absolute.

As has been mentioned above, the purposes and content of a good
government are vague and are not precisely defined. Suppose we in-
dicate it by a formula such as the promotion of “the material and
moral well-being and social progress” as in the case of the Mandate
for South West Africa. An infinite number of policies can be conceived
that would achieve the purposes of good government, which are general
and abstract. In concrete, individual cases, the objectives which should
be achieved may be spiritual or material, direct or indirect, important
or less important, essential or non-essential, urgent or non-urgent. Good
government is concerned with the choice of means to attain certain
ends. This is a characteristic of politics and administration where the
discretionary power of the competent authorities prevails, and since
the Mandate aims at the well-being and progress of the inhabitants, it
therefore belongs to the category of politics and administration, is
characterized by the discretionary nature of the Mandatory’s activities.

Briefly, to promote the well-being and progress of the inhabitants,
many policies and measures are conceivable. The Mandatory has a
discretionary power to choose those it considers to be the most appro-
priate and efficient means of realizing the said objectives of the Mandate.

There is a question, posed by Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice on
7 May 1965 (C.R. 65/27, pp. 57-59) to both Parties, in relation to
whether the requirement of the “promotion of well-being and social
progress” can be satisfied by any total increase, namely by considering


First we consider the international conventions (or treaties). Here
we are not concerned with “special” or “particular” law-making bilateral
treaties, but only with law-making multilateral treaties such as the Charter
of the United Nations, the Constitution of the International Labour
Organisation, the Genocide Convention, which have special significance
as legislative methods. However, even such law-making treaties bind
only signatory States and they do not bind States which are not parties
to them.

The question is whether the Charter of the United Nations contains
a legal norm of equality before the law and the principle of non-dis-



crimination on account of religion, race, colour, sex, language, political
creed, etc. The achievement of international co-operation in “promoting
and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms
for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion” consti-
tutes one of the purposes of the United Nations (Article 1, paragraph 3).
Next, the General Assembly shall initiate studies and make recommen-
dations for the purpose of: “... (b) .. . and assisting in the realization
of human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to
race, sex, language, or religion” (Article 13, paragraph 1 (b)). “Uni-
versal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or re-
ligion” is one of the items which shall be promoted by the United Nations
in the field of international economic and social co-operation (Articles 55
(c), 56). In this field, the Economic and Social Council may make
recommendations for the purpose of promoting respect for, and obser-
vance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all (Article 62,
paragraph 2, Charter). Finally, “to encourage respect for human rights
and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion” is indicated as one of the basic objectives of the
trusteeship system (Article 76 (c)).

The repeated references in the Charter to the fundamental rights and
freedoms—at least four times—presents itself as one of its differences
from the Covenant of the League of Nations, in which the existence of
intimate relationships between peace and respect for human rights were
not so keenly felt as in the Charter of the United Nations. However,
the Charter did not go so far as to give the definition to the fundamental
rights and freedoms, nor to provide any machinery of implementation
for the protection and guarantee of these rights and freedoms. The
“Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms”
of 1948 which wanted to formulate each right and freedom and give them
concrete content, is no more than a declaration adopted by the General
Assembly and not a treaty binding on the member States. The goal of the
codification on the matter of human rights and freedoms has until now
not been reached save in very limited degree, namely with the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms of 1953, the validity of which is only regional and not universal
and with a few special conventions, such as “genocide” and political rights

part of the mandates system and therefore is embodied in the Mandate.
From the natural-law character of this principle its inclusion in the Man-
date must be justified.

It appears to be a paradox that the inhabitants of the mandated
territories are internationally more protected than citizens of States
by the application of Article 7, paragraph 2, but this interpretation falls
outside the scope of the present proceedings.

protection of minority groups in multi-cultural communities and cover
not only the field of public law but also of private law.

The doctrine of different treatment of diverse population groups
constitutes a fundamental political principle by which the Respondent
administers not only the Republic of South Africa, but the neighbouring
Territory of South West Africa. The geographical, historical, ethnologi-
cal, economic and cultural differences and varieties between several
population groups, according to the contention of the Respondent,

have necessitated the adoption of the policy of apartheid or ‘separate
development”. This policy is said to be required for the purpose of
the promotion of the well-being and social progress of the inhabitants
of the Territory. The Respondent insists that each population group
developing its own characteristics and individuality, to attain self-
determination, separate development should be the best way to realize
the well-being and social progress of the inhabitants. The other alter-
native, namely the mixed integral society in the sense of Western


v4 SOUTH WEST AFRICA (DISS. OP. TANAKA)

democracy would necessarily lead to competition, friction, struggle,
chaos, bloodshed, and dictatorship as examples may be found in some
other African countries. Therefore, the most appropriate method of
administration of the Territory is the principle of indirect rule main-
taining and utilizing the merits of tribalism.

The freedom of individual persons, being one of the fundamental ideas
of law, is not unlimited and must be restricted by the principle of equality
allotting to each individual a sphere of freedom which is due to him. In
other words the freedom can exist only under the premise of the equality
principle.

In what way is each individual allotted his sphere of freedom by


We cannot imagine in what case the distinction between Natives and
Whites, namely racial distinction apart from linguistic, cultural or other
differences, may necessarily have an influence on the establishment of
the rights and duties of the inhabitants of the territory.
