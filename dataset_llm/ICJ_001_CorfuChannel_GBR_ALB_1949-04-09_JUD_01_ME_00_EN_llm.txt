The Court consequently finds that the following facts are
established. The two ships were mined in Albanian territorial
waters in a previously swept and check-swept channel just at
the place where a newly laid minefield consisting of moored
contact German GY mines was discovered three weeks later.
The damage sustained by the ships was inconsistent with damage
which could have been caused by floating mines, magnetic ground
mines, magnetic moored mines, or German GR mines, but its
nature and extent were such as would be caused by mines of
the type found in the minefield. In such circumstances the
Court arrives at the conclusion that the explosions were due to
mines belonging to that minefield.

resulting from the Treaty of friendship and mutual assistance
signed by those two States on July gth, 1946.

The Court considers that, even in so far as these facts are estab-
lished, they lead to no firm conclusion. It has not been legally
established that Yugoslavia possessed any GY mines, and the
origin of the mines laid in Albanian territorial waters remains a
matter for conjecture. It is clear that the existence of a treaty,
such as that of July gth, 1946, however close may be the bonds
uniting its signatories, in no way leads to the conclusion that
they participated in a criminal act.

On its side, the Yugoslav Government, although not a party
to the proceedings, authorized the Albanian Government to
produce certain Yugoslav documents, for the purpose of refuting
the United Kingdom contention that the mines had been laid
by two ships of the Yugoslav Navy. As the Court was anxious
for full light to be thrown on the facts alleged, it did not refuse
to receive these documents. But Yugoslavia’s absence from the
proceedings meant that these documents could only be admitted
as evidence subject to reserves, and the Court finds it unnecessary
to express an opinion upon their probative value.

The Court need not dwell on the assertion of one of the Counsel
for the Albanian Government that the minefield might have been
laid by the Greek Government. It is enough to say that this
was a mere conjecture which, as Counsel himself admitted, was
based on no proof.

In the light of the information now available to the Court, the
authors of the minelaying remain unknown. In any case, the task
of the Court, as defined by the Special Agreement, is to decide
whether Albania is responsible, under international law, for the
explosions which occurred on October 22nd, 1946, and to give
judgment as to the compensation, if any.

Finally, the United Kingdom Government put forward the
argument that, whoever the authors of the minelaying were, it
could not have been done without the Albanian Government’s
knowledge.


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 18

It is clear that knowledge of the minelaying cannot be imputed
to the Albanian Government by reason merely of the fact that
a minefield discovered in Albanian territorial waters caused the
explosions of which the British warships were the victims. It
is true, as international practice shows, that a State on whose
territory or in whose waters an act contrary to international
law has occurred, may be called upon to give an explanation.
It is also true that that State cannot evade such a request by
limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances
of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain
point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of
the means of information and inquiry at its disposal. But it
cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised
by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily
knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated
therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known,
the authors. This fact, by itself and apart from. other circum-
stances, neither involves prima facie respansibility nor shifts
the burden of proof.

On the other hand, the fact of this exclusive territorial control
exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the
methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that
State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control,
the other State, the. victim of a breach of international law, is
often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to
responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal
recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This
indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use
is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded
as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked
together and leading logically to a single conclusion.

by means of indirect evidence that Albania has knowledge of mine-
laying in her territorial waters independently of any connivance
on her part in this operation. The proof may be drawn from
inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable
doubt. The elements of fact on which these inferences can be
based may differ from those which are relevant to the question of
connivance.

constantly kept a close watch over the waters of the North Corfu
Channel, at any rate after May 1946. This vigilance is proved


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 19

by the declaration of the Albanian Delegate in the Security
Council on February 19th, 1947 (Official Records of the Security
Council, Second Year, No. 16, p..328), and especially by the
diplomatic notes of the Albanian Government concerning the
passage of foreign ships through its territorial waters. This
vigilance sometimes went so far as to involve the use of force:
for example the gunfire in the direction of the British cruisers
Orion and Superb on May 15th, 1946, and the shots fired at the
U.N.R.R.A. tug and barges on October zoth, 1946, as established
by the affidavit of Enrico Bargellini, which was not seriously
contested.

The Albanian Government’s notes aré all evidence of its intention
to keep a jealous watch on its territorial waters. The note verbale
addressed to the United Kingdom on May 21st, 1946, reveals the
existence of a “General Order”, in execution of which the Coastal
Commander gave the order to fire in the direction of the British
cruisers. This same note formulates a demand that ‘‘permission”
shall be given, by the Albanian authorities, for passage through
territorial waters. The insistence on ‘formalities’ and ‘“‘permis-
sion” by Albania is repeated in the Albanian note of June roth.

As the Parties agree that the minefield had been recently laid,
it must be concluded that the operation was carried out during
the period of close watch by the Albanian authorities in this sector.
This conclusion renders the Albanian Government's assertion of
ignorance a priori somewhat improbable.

The Court also noted the reply of Captain Ali Shtino to a
question put by it; this reply shows that the witness, who had
been called on to replace the Coastal Defence Commander for a
period of thirteen to fifteen days, immediately before the events
of October 22nd, had received the following order: “That the
look-out posts must inform me of every movement [in the Corfu
Channel], and that no action would be taken on our part.”

The telegrams sent by the Albanian Government on Novem-
ber 13th and November 27th, 1946, to the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, at a time when that Government was fully aware
of the discovery of the minefield in Albanian territorial waters,
are especially significant of the measures taken by the Albanian
Government. In the first telegram, that Government raised the
strongest protest against the movements and activity of British
naval units in its territorial waters on November 12th and 13th,
1946, without even mentioning the existence of a minefield in
these waters. In the second, it repeats its accusations against
the United Kingdom, without in any way protesting against the
laying of this minefield which, if effected without Albania’s consent,
constituted a very serious violation of her sovereignty.

Another indication of the Albanian Government's knowledge
consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 20

presence of mines in its waters, at the moment when it must have
known this, at the latest after the sweep on November 13th, and
further, whereas the Greek Government immediately appointed
a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22nd, the
Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did
it proceed to the judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case,
on the territorial sovereign.

This attitude does not seem reconcilable with the alleged ignorance
of the Albanian authorities that the minefield had been laid in
Albanian territorial waters. It could be explained if the Albanian
Government, while knowing of the minelaying, desired the circum-
stances of the operation to remain secret.

2. As regards the possibility of observing minelaying from the
Albanian coast, the Court regards the following facts, relating to
the technical conditions of a secret minelaying and to the Albanian
surveillance, as particularly important.

The Bay of Saranda and the channel used by shipping through
the Strait are, from their geographical configuration, easily
watched ; the entrance of the bay is dominated by heights offering
excellent observation points, both over the bay and over the
Strait ; whilst the channel throughout is close to the Albanian coast.
The laying of a minefield in these waters could hardly fail to have
been observed by the Albanian coastal defences.

On this subject, it must first be said that the minelaying oper-
ation itself must have required a certain time. The method adopted
required, according to the Experts of the Court, the methodical and
well thought-out laying of two rows of mines that had clearly a
combined offensive and defensive purpose : offensive, to prevent the
passage, through the Channel, of vessels drawing ten feet of water
or more ; defensive, to prevent vessels of the same draught from
entering the Bay of Saranda. The report of the Experts reckons
the time that the minelayers would have been in the waters,
between Cape Kiephali and St. George's Monastery, at between
two and two and a half hours. This is sufficient time to attract
the attention of the observation posts, placed, as the Albanian
Government stated, at Cape Kiephali and St. George’s Monastery.

The facilities for observation from the coast are confirmed
by the two following circumstances: the distance of the nearest
mine from the coast was only 500 metres; the minelayers must
have passed at not more than about 500 metres from the coast
between Denta Point and St. George's Monastery.

Being anxious to obtain any technical information that might
guide it in its search for the truth, the Court submitted the
following question to the Experts appointed by it :


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 21

“On the assumption that the mines discovered on Novem-
ber 13th, 1946, were laid at some date within the few preceding
months, whoever may have laid them, you are requested to examine
theinformation available regarding (a) the number and the nature of
the mines, (b) the means for laying them, and (c) the time required
to do so, having regard to the different states of the sea, the condi-
tions of the locality, and the different weather conditions, and to
ascertain whether it is possible in that way to draw any conclusions,
and. if so, what conclusions, in regard to:

(1) the means employed for laying the minefield discovered
on November 13th, 1946, and

(2) the possibility of mooring those mines with those means
without the Albanian authorities being aware of it, having
regard to the extent of the measures of vigilance existing in the

Saranda region.”

As the first Report submitted by the Experts did not seem
entirely conclusive, the Court, by a decision of January 17th, 1949,
asked the Experts to go to Saranda and to verify, complete and,
if necessary, modify their answers. In this way, observations
were made and various experiments carried out on the spot,
in the presence of the experts of the Parties and of Albanian
officials, with a view to estimating the possibility of the mine-
laying having been observed by the Albanian look-cut posts.
On this subject reference must be made to a test of visibility
by night, carried out on the evening of January 28th, 1049, at
St. George's Monastery. A motor ship, 27 metres long, and
with no bridge, wheel-house, or funnel, and very low on the
water, was used. The ship was completely blacked out, and on
a moonless night, i.e., under the most favourable conditions for
avoiding discovery, it was clearly seen and heard from St. George's
Monastery. The noise of the motor was heard at a distance
of 1,800 metres, and the ship itself was sighted at 570 metres
and remained visible up to about 1,900 metres.

The Experts’ Report on this visit stated that :

“The Experts consider it to be indisputable that if a normal
look-out was kept at Cape Kiephali, Denta Point, and St. George's
Monastery, and if the look-outs were equipped with binoculars as
has been stated, under normal weather conditions for this area,
the minelaying operations shown in Annex g to the United King-
dom Memorial must have been noticed by these coastguards.”

The Court cannot fail to give great weight to the opinion of
the Experts who examined the locality in a manner giving every
guarantee of correct and impartial information. Apart from the
existence of a look-out post at Cape Denta, which has not been
proved, the Court, basing itself on the declarations of the Albanian
Government that look-out posts were stationed at Cape Kiephali
and St. George's Monastery, refers to the following conclusions


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 22

in the Experts’ Report : (1) that in the case of minelaying from
the North towards the South, the minelayers would have been
seen from Cape Kiephali; (2) in the case of minelaying from
the South, the minelayers would have been seen from Cape
Kiephali and St. George's Monastery.

From all the facts and observations mentioned above, the
Court draws the conclusion that the laying of the minefield which
caused the explosions on October 22nd, 1946, could not have been
accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government.

The obligations resulting for Albania from this knowledge are
not disputed between the Parties. Counsel for the Albanian
Government expressly recognized that {trans/ation] “if Albania had
been informed of the operation before the incidents of October 22nd,
and in time to warn the British vessels and shipping in general
of the existence of mines in the Corfu Channel, her responsibility
would be involved....”.

The obligations incumbent upon the Albanian authorities
consisted in notifying, for the benefit of shipping in general, the
existence of a minefield in Albanian territorial waters and in
warning the approaching British warships of the imminent danger
to which the minefield exposed them. Such obligations are based,
not on the Hague Convention of 1907, No. VIII, which is applic-
able in time of war, but on certain general and well-recognized
principles, namely : elementary considerations of humanity, even
more exacting in peace than in war ; the principle of the freedom
of maritime communication ; and every State’s obligation not to
allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the
rights of other States.

In fact, Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield,
nor warned the British warships of the danger they were
approaching.

But Albania’s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of
mines in her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge
of that fact in sufficient time before October 22nd ; and the duty
of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the British ships depends
on the time’ that elapsed between the moment that these ships
were reported and the moment of the first explosion.

On this subject, the Court makes the following observations.
As has already been stated, the Parties agree that the mines were
recently laid. It must be concluded that the minelaying, whatever
may have been its exact date, was done at a time when there
was a close Albanian surveillance over the Strait. If it be sup-
posed that it took place at the last possible moment, i.e., in the
night of October 21st-22nd, the only conclusion to be drawn would


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 23

be that a general notification to the shipping of all States before
the time of the explosions would have been difficult, perhaps even
impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the
Albanian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all
necessary steps immediately to warn ships near the danger zone,
more especially those that were approaching that zone. When
on October 22nd about 13.00 hours the British warships were
reported by the look-out post at St. George's Monastery to the
Commander of the Coastal Defences as approaching ‘Cape Long,
it was perfectly possible for the Albanian authorities to use the
interval of almost two hours that elapsed before the explosion
affecting Saumarez (14.53 hours or 14.55 hours) to warn the vessels
of the danger into which they were running.

In fact, nothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to
prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the inter-
national responsibility of Albania.

In the final submissions contained in its oral reply, the United
Kingdom Government asked the Court to give judgment that,
as a result of the breach by the Albanian Government of its
obligations under international law, it had sustained damages
amounting to £845,000.

In the last oral statement submitted in its name, the Albanian
Government, for the first time, asserted that the Court would
not have jurisdiction, in virtue of the Special Agreement, to
assess the amount of compensation. No reason was given in
support of this new assertion, and the United Kingdom Agent
did not ask leave to reply. The question of the Court’s jurisdiction
was not argued between the Parties.

In the first question of the Special Agreement the Court is
asked :

(i) Is Albania under international law responsible for the
explosions and for the damage and loss of human life which
resulted from them, and

(ii) is there any duty to pay compensation ?

This text gives rise to certain doubts. If point (i) is answered
in the affirmative, it follows from the establishment of respons-


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 24

ibility that compensation is due, and it would be superfluous
to add point (ii) unless the Parties had something else in mind
than a mere declaration by the Court that compensation is due.
It would indeed be incompatible with the generally accepted
rules of interpretation to admit that a provision of this sort
occurring in a special agreement should be devoid of purport
or effect. In this connexion, the Court refers to the views expressed
by the Permanent Court of International Justice with regard
to similar questions of interpretation. In Advisory Opinion
No. 13 of July 23rd, 1926, that Court said (Series B., No. 13,
p. 19): “But, so far as concerns the specific question of com-
petence now pending, it may suffice to observe that the Court,
in determining the nature and scope of a measure, must look to
its practical effect rather than to the predominant motive that
may be conjectured to have inspired it.” In its Order of
August 19th, 1929, in the Free Zones case, the Court said (Series A.,
No. 22, p. 13) : “in case of doubt, the clauses of a special agreement
by which a dispute is referred to the Court must, if it does not
involve doing violence to their terms, be construed in a manner
enabling the clauses themselves to have appropriate effects”

The Court thinks it necessary to refer to the different stages
of the procedure. In its Resolution of April oth, 1947, the
Security Council recommended that the two Governments should
immediately refer ‘‘the dispute” to the Court. This Resolution
had without doubt for its aim the final adjustment of the whole
dispute. In pursuance of the Resolution, the Government of the

Neither the Albanian nor the United Kingdom Agent suggested
in any way that the Special Agreement had limited the competence
of the Court in this matter to a decision merely upon the principle
of compensation or that the United Kingdom Government had
abandoned an important part of its original claim. The main


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 25

object both Parties had in mind when they concluded the Special
Agreement was to establish a complete equality between them by
replacing the original procedure based on a unilateral Application

“with statements and submissions”. These submissions included
the claim for a fixed sum of compensation.

The subsequent attitude of the Parties shows that it was not
their intention, by entering into the Special Agreement, to preclude
the Court from fixing the amount of the compensation. In its
Reply (paragraph 71) the United Kingdom Government maintained
the submissions contained in paragraph 96 of its Memorial, including
the claim for a fixed amount of reparation. This claim was
expressly repeated in the final United Kingdom submissions. In
paragraph 52 of its Counter-Memorial, the Albanian Government
stated that it had no knowledge of the loss of human life and
damage to ships, but it did not contest the Court’s competence to
decide this question. In the Rejoinder, paragraph 96, that Govern-
ment declared that, owing to its claim for the dismissal of the case,
it was unnecessary for it to examine the United Kingdom’s claim
for reparation. [Transialion.] “It reserves the right if need be,
to discuss this point which should obviously form the subject
of an expert opinion.” Having regard to what is said above as
to the previous attitude of that Government, this statement must
be considered as an implied acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction
to decide this question.

It may be asked why the Parties, when drafting the Special
Agreement, did not expressly ask the Court to assess the amount
of the damage, but used the words : ‘‘and is there any duty to pay
compensation ?’”’ It seems probable that the explanation is to
be found in the similarity between this clause and the corresponding
clause in the second part of the Special Agreement : “and is there

was violated by reason of the acts of the British Navy in Albanian
waters on October 22nd, 1946.


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 27

On May 15th, 1946, the British cruisers Orion and Superb,
while passing southward through the North Corfu Channel, were
fired at by an Albanian battery in the vicinity of Saranda. It
appears from the report of the commanding naval officer dated
May 29th, 1946, that the firing started when the ships had already
passed the battery and were moving away from it ; that from 12 to
20 rounds were fired ; that the firing lasted 12 minutes and ceased
only when the ships were out of range ; but that the ships were not
hit although there were a number of “shorts” and of “‘overs”.
An Albanian note of May 21st states that the Coastal Commander
ordered a few shots to be fired in the direction of the ships “‘in
accordance with a General Order founded on international law”.

The United Kingdom Government at once protested to the
Albanian Government, stating that innocent passage through
straits is a right recognized by international law. There ensued
a diplomatic correspondence in which the Albanian Government
asserted that foreign warships and merchant vessels had no right
to pass through Albanian territorial waters without prior noti-
fication to, and the permission of, the Albanian authorities. This
view was put into effect by a communication of the Albanian
Chief of Staff, dated May 17th, 1946, which purported to subject
the passage of foreign warships and merchant vessels in Albanian
territorial waters to previous notification to and authorization by the
Albanian Government. The diplomatic correspondence continued,
and culminated in a United Kingdom note of August 2nd, 1946,
in which the United Kingdom Government maintained its view
with regard to the right of innocent passage through straits forming
routes for international maritime traffic between two parts of the
high seas. The note ended with the warning that if Albanian
coastal batteries in the future opened fire on any British warship

The Commander-in-Chief answered the next day that his ships
had not done so yet, but that it was his intention that Mauritius
and Leander and two destroyers should do so when they departed
from Corfu on October 22nd.

It was in such circumstances that these two cruisers together
with the destroyers Saumarez and Volage were sent through the
North Corfu Strait on that date.


It may be asked whether the test is to be found in the volume of
traffic passing through the Strait or in its greater or lesser importance
for international navigation. But in the opinion of the Court the
decisive criterion is rather its geographical situation as connecting
two parts of the high seas and the fact of its being used for inter-
national navigation. Nor can it be decisive that this Strait is not
a necessary route between two parts of the high seas, but only
an alternative passage between the Ægean and the Adriatic Seas.
It has nevertheless been a useful route for international maritime
traffic. In this respect, the Agent of the United Kingdom Govern-
ment gave the Court the following information relating to the


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 29

period from April 1st, 1936, to December 31st, 1937 : “The follow-
ing is the total number of ships putting in at the Port of Corfu
after passing through or just before passing through the Channel.
During the period of one year nine months, the total number of
ships was 2,884. The flags of the ships are Greek, Italian, Rou-
manian, Yugoslav, French, Albanian and British. Clearly, very
small vessels are included, as the entries for Albanian vessels are
high, and of course one vessel may make several journeys, but
2,884 ships for a period of one year nine months is quite a large
figure. These figures relate to vessels visited by the Customs at
Corfu and so do not include the large number. of vessels which went
through the Strait without calling at Corfu at all.” There were
also regular sailings through the Strait by Greek vessels three times
weekly, by a British ship fortnightly, and by two Yugoslav vessels
weekly and by two others fortnightly. The Court is further
informed that the British Navy has regularly used this Channel
for eighty years or more, and that it has also been used by the
navies of other States.

One fact of particular importance is that the North Corfu
Channel constitutes a frontier between Albania and Greece, that
a part of it is wholly within the territorial waters of these States,
and that the Strait is of special importance to Greece by reason of
the traffic to and from the port of Corfu.

Having regard to these various considerations, the Court has
arrived at the conclusion that the North Corfu Channel should
be considered as belonging to the class of international highways
through which passage cannot be prohibited by a coastal State
in time of peace.


in these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the more
general question, much debated by the Parties, whether States
under international law have a right to send warships in time of
peace through territorial waters not included in a strait.

The Albanian Government has further contended that the
sovereignty of Albania was violated because the passage of the
British warships on October 22nd, 1946, was not an innocent
passage. The reasons advanced in support of this contention
may be summed up as follows : The passage was not an ordinary
passage, but a political mission ; the ships were manoeuvring
and sailing in diamond combat formation with soldiers on board ;
the position of the guns was not consistent with innocent passage ;
the vessels passed with crews at action stations; the number of
the ships and their armament surpassed what was necessary in order
to attain their object and showed an intention to intimidate and
not merely to pass ; the ships had received orders to observe and
report upon the coastal defences and this order was carried out.

It is shown by the Admiralty telegram of September 21st, cited
above, and admitted by the United Kingdom Agent, that the
object of sending the warships through the Strait was not only
to carry out a passage for purposes of navigation, but also to
test Albania’s attitude. As mentioned above, the Albanian
Government, on May 15th, 1946, tried to impose by means of

the passage was carried out was consistent with the principle of
innocent passage and to examine the various contentions of the
Albanian Government in so far as they appear to be relevant.

When the Albanian coastguards at St. George's Monastery
reported that the British warships were sailing in combat forma-
tion and were manoeuvring, they must have been under a misap-
prehension. it is shown by the evidence that the ships were not
proceeding in combat formation, but in line, one after the other,


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 3I

and that they were not manoeuvring until after the first explosion.
Their movements thereafter were due tc the explosions and were
made necessary in order to save human life and the mined ships. It
is shown by the evidence of witnesses that the contention that
soldiers were on board must be due to a misunderstanding probably
arising from the fact that the two.cruisers carried their usual detach-
ment of marines.

It is known from the above-mentioned order issued by the British
Admiralty on August 10th, 1946, that ships, when using the North
Corfu Strait, must pass with armament in fore and aft position.
That this order was carried out during the passage on October 22nd
is stated by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, in a telegram
of October 26th to the Admiralty. The guns were, he reported,

3I

THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 32

ber 23rd, 1946—a report relating to the passage on the 2z2nd—it
is stated : “The most was made of the opportunities to study
Albanian defences at close range. These included, with reference
to XCU....”—and he then gives a description of some coastal
defences.

In accordance with Article 49 of the Statute of the Court and
Article 54 of its Rules, the Court requested the United Kingdom
Agent to produce the documents referred to as XCU for the use
of the Court. Those documents were not produced, the Agent
pleading naval secrecy ; and the United Kingdom witnesses declined
to answer questions relating to them. It is not therefore possible
to know the real content of these naval orders. The Court cannot,
however, draw from this refusal to produce the orders any con-
clusions differing from those to which the actual events gave rise.
The United Kingdom Agent stated that the instructions in these
orders related solely to the contingency of shots being fired from
the coast—which did not happen. - If it is true, as the commander
of Volage said in evidence, that the orders contained information
concerning certain positions from which the British warships might
have been fired at, it cannot be deduced therefrom that the vessels
had received orders to reconnoitre Albanian coastal defences.
Lastly, as the Court has to judge of the innocent nature of the
passage, it cannot remain indifferent to the fact that, though two
warships struck mines, there was no reaction, either on their
part or on that of the cruisers that accompanied them.

With regard to the observations of coastal defences made after

the sovereignty of Albania by reason of the acts of the British Navy
in Albanian waters on October 22nd, 1946.

In addition to the passage of the United Kingdom warships on
October 22nd, 1946, the second question in the Special Agreement
relates to the acts of the Royal Navy in Albanian waters on
November 1zth and 13th, 1946. This is the minesweeping oper-
ation called ‘Operation Retail’ by the Parties during the pro-
ceedings. This name will be used in the present Judgment.



THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 33

After the explosions of October 22nd, the United Kingdom
Government sent a note to the Albanian Government, in which
it announced its intention to sweep the Corfu Channel shortly.
The Albanian reply, which was received in London on October 31st,
stated that the Albanian Government would not give its consent
to this unless the operation in question took place outside Albanian
territorial waters. Meanwhile, at the United Kingdom Govern-
ment’s request, the International Central Mine Clearance Board
decided, in a resolution of November Ist, 1946, that there should
be a further sweep of the Channel, subject to Albania’s consent.
The United Kingdom Government having informed the Albanian
Government, in a communication of November 10th, that the
proposed sweep would take place on November 12th, the Albanian
Government replied on the 11th, protesting against this ‘‘unilateral
decision of His Majesty's Government’’. It said it did not con-
sider it inconvenient that the British fleet should undertake the
sweeping of the channel of navigation, but added that, before
sweeping was carried out, it considered it indispensable to decide
what area of the sea should be deemed to constitute this channel,
and proposed the establishment of a Mixed Commission for the
purpose. It ended by saying that any sweeping undertaken
without the consent of the Albanian Government outside the chan-
nel thus constituted, i.e., inside Albanian territorial waters where
foreign warships have no reason to sail, could only be considered
as a deliberate violation of Albanian territory and sovereignty.

After this exchange of notes, ‘Operation Retail’ took place
on November 12th and 13th. Commander Mestre, of the French
Navy, was asked to attend as observer, and was present at the
sweep on November 13th. The operation was carried out under
the protection of an important covering force composed of an
aircraft carrier, cruisers and other war vessels. This covering
force remained throughout the operation at a certain distance
to the west of the Channel, except for the frigate St. Bride's Bay,
which was stationed in the Channel south-east of Cape Kiephali.
The sweep began in the morning of November 13th, at about
9 o'clock, and ended in the afternoon near nightfall. The area
swept was in Albanian territorial waters, and within the limits
of the channel previously swept.

The United Kingdom Government does not dispute that ‘’Oper-
ation Retail” was carried out against the clearly expressed wish of
the Albanian Government. It recognizes that the operation had not
the consent of the international mine clearance organizations, that
it could not be justified as the exercise of a right of innocent
passage, and lastly that, in principle, international law does not
allow a State to assemble a large number of warships in the

and 1945 were considered as having effected complete safety.
As a consequence, the allocation of the sector in question to
Greece, and, therefore, the permission of the Hellenic Government
which is relied on, were both of them merely nominal. It is
also to be remarked that Albania was not consulted regarding
the allocation to Greece of the sector in question, despite the
fact that the Channel passed through Albanian territorial waters.

But, in fact, the explosions of October 22nd, 1946, in a channel
declared safe for navigation, and one which the United Kingdom
Government, more than any other government, had reason to
consider safe, raised quite a different problem from that of a routine
sweep carried out under the orders of the mineclearance organiz-
ations. These explosions were suspicious ; they raised a question
of responsibility.

Accordingly, this was the ground on which the United Kingdom
Government chose to establish its main line of defence. According
to that Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly
as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving
traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian
authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the
United Kingdom Government's arguments. It was presented
first as a new and special application of the theory of intervention,
by means of which the State intervening would secure possession
of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit
it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.


THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) 35

The Court cannot accept such a line of defence. The Court
can only regard the alleged right of intervention as the mani-
festation of a policy of force, such as has, in the past, given rise
to most serious abuses and such as cannot, whatever be the
present defects in international organization, find a place in
international law. Intervention is perhaps still less admissible
in the particular form it would take here; for, from the nature
of things, it would be reserved for the most powerful States,
and might easily lead to perverting the administration of inter-
national justice itself.

The United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further
classified ‘Operation Retail” among methods of self-protection or
self-help. The Court cannot accept this defence either. Between
independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential
foundation of international relations. The Court recognizes that
the Albanian Government's complete failure to carry out its duties
after the explosions, and the dilatory nature of its diplomatic notes,
are extenuating circumstances for the action of the United
Kingdom Government. But to ensure respect for international
law, of which it is the organ, the Court must declare that the
action of the British Navy co stituted a violation of Albanian
sovereignty.
