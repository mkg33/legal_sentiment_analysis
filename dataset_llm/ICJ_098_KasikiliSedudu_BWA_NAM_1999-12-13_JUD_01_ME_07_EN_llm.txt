I have voted against paragraphs | and 2 of the dispositif of the Court’s
Judgment. For the reasons which I will explain below, I dissent from the
Court’s interpretation of the term the “main channel of that river”/
“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses”! in Article III (2) of the 1890 Treaty as mean-
ing the northern rather than the southern channel of the Chobe around
Kasikili/Sedudu Island. As for the rest of the Judgment, I agree with
almost all its other parts, including the conclusion that the rules reflected
in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention are applicable to the interpreta-
tion of the 1890 Treaty and the finding that the boundary established by
Article HI (2) of that Treaty follows the thalweg rather than the median
line of the main channel. As the Court does not accept Namibia’s argu-
ment on acquisitive prescription, the territorial status of the Island
depends entirely on the course of the boundary. My dissent on the inter-
pretation of the term “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses
Flusses” therefore affects not only my view on the location of the bound-
ary, but also my view on the status of the Island. This explains why
I voted not only against the first but also against the second paragraph of
the dispositif. For considerations which I will also explain below, I voted,
however, in favour of the third paragraph.

Among the many parts of the Judgment with which I agree, is the
Court’s conclusion that Namibia has no title to the Island based on pre-
scription, as

“Namibia has not established with the necessary degree of preci-
sion and certainty that acts of State authority capable of providing
alternative justification for prescriptive title, in accordance with the
conditions set out by Namibia, were carried out by its predecessors
or by itself with regard to Kasikili/Sedudu Island” (Judgment,
para. 99).

! In Article ILI (2) of the 1890 Treaty the term is used in the genitive. That makes it read


But, in my view, the Court should also have found that Namibia’s imme-
diate predecessor in the Caprivi Strip, South Africa, could not have
acquired prescriptive title over the Island.

The Applicable Law

1. The Judgment correctly starts from the fact that although

“neither Botswana nor Namibia are parties to the Vienna Conven-
tion on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, . . . both of them con-
sider that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is applicable inasmuch
as it reflects customary international law” (Judgment, para. 18).

The Judgment goes on to say that “[t]he Court itself has already had
occasion in the past to hold that customary international law found
expression in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention” (ibid.); it further says

“Article 4 of the Convention, which provides that it ‘applies only
to treaties which are concluded by States after the entry into force of
the . . . Convention . . ." does not, therefore, prevent the Court from
interpreting the 1890 Treaty in accordance with the rules reflected in
Article 31 of the Convention.” (Jbid.)

2. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties establishes in its
Articles 31-33 a system of treaty interpretation. Article 31, paragraph 1,
provides that, based on the principle of good faith, the ordinary meaning
of the term to be interpreted has to be explored in the light of the object
and purpose of the treaty in which the term finds itself and the context in
which it is used. While upholding that the parties are to be presumed to
have that intention, which appears from the terms used by them, the
Vienna Convention thus does not force the Court to find the abstract
meaning of contested terms and to proceed on that basis; what the Court
is asked is rather to explore the intention of the Parties, the reason why
they used the particular term, and to proceed on that more nuanced
basis.

The Ordinary Meaning of the Term “the Main Channel of That
River" [*Hauptlauf dieses Flusses”

3. Looking at the term as used in Article III (2) of the 1890 Treaty,
I note that in its ordinary meaning it does not give an even approximately
precise indication of the channel of the Chobe River in which the delimi-



tation between the British and the German spheres of interest is to be
placed. It seems that the negotiating parties had, through reports of trav-
ellers and explorers and early maps prepared by them, a superficial
knowledge of the topography they were dealing with (see Benjamin Brad-
shaw, “Notes on the Chobe River, South Central Africa”, Proceedings of
the Royal Geographic Society (1881), pp. 208 ff., Memorial of Namibia,
Vol. V, Ann. 115, pp. 117 ff.; Map 1/2, ibid., Vol. VIT, p. 4). The reference
to the “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” indicates
that they knew that the Chobe has, at different locations at least, several
channels, and that they wanted to place the line of delimitation into
the principal one of these channels. But there the matter ends. There is
neither in English nor in German a common understanding of the term
which would apply in a general fashion to the determination, in case of
doubt, which among several channels of a river is the main one. There is
— as the discussion about the role of navigability in the determination of
the main channel of the Chobe shows — not even agreement on all of the
criteria which play a role for that evaluation and disagreement on the
meaning or weight to be given to some of them. And the same is true for
the German word “Hauptlauf”.

Nor is there an ordinary meaning of the term “main channel of that
river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in a hydrological sense. The intense
hydrological debate which has taken place for years between the Parties
and during these proceedings before the Court, was about, inter alia, the
annual flow of water that goes through either of the two channels and in
this context about what precisely constitutes the southern channel, the
comparative visibility of the two channels during the flow seasons and
during the dry parts of the year and the bed profile configuration of the
channels. The Parties did not only disagree in substance on these matters,
but also on their relevance and applicability in the determination of the
main channel of the Chobe at Kasikili/Sedudu Island.

4. The Judgment lays much weight on the ordinary meaning of the
term “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses”. In order to
define that meaning, the Court bases itself on “the most commonly used
criteria in international law and practice, to which the Parties have
referred” (Judgment, para. 27).

Accordingly, the Court addresses the criteria relied on by the Parties
and analyses their views on each of them before formulating brief con-
clusions of its own (Judgment, paras. 29-41). As a result, the Court is no
more successful in establishing the ordinary meaning of “main channel
of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” than the Parties are in their
parallel efforts. A number of the conclusions arrived at by the Court
are not arbitrary as they are based on presentations by the Parties, but
nevertheless subjective in nature and without a clear justification. In
the end the Court’s conclusion that



“in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms that appear
in the pertinent provision of the 1890 Treaty, the northern channel
of the River Chobe around Kasikili/Sedudu Island must be regarded
as its main channel” (Judgment, para. 41)

remains unconvincing.

Apparently recognizing the shortcomings of its efforts, the Court
repeatedly refers to the findings of Captain Eason in 1912, Messrs. Trol-
lope and Redman in 1948, and the Joint Survey of 1985, all of which are
to the effect that, at Kasikili/Sedudu Island, the northern channel of the
Chobe has to be regarded as the “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf
dieses Flusses” (Judgment para. 33, para. 42, and para. 80). The Judg-
ment correctly states that those findings do not constitute subsequent
agreements or subsequent practice in the sense of Article 31, paragraph 3,
but refers to them as giving support to its own conclusion on the north-
ern channel as the main channel of the Chobe around Kasikili/Sedudu
Island:

“The Court finds that these facts, while not constituting subse-
quent practice by the parties in the interpretation of the 1890 Treaty,
nevertheless support the conclusions which it has reached by inter-
preting Article III, paragraph 2, of the 1890 Treaty in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms . . .” (Judgment,
para. 80.)

they reached their conclusions; moreover, the report on the Joint Survey,
according to South Africa, did not prove conclusively that the Island
belongs to Botswana.

In its effort to establish an ordinary meaning of the term to be inter-
preted, on which the Court could proceed, the Judgment is not fully con-
sonant with the system of interpretation provided for by the Vienna Con-
vention. It discusses only certain aspects of the object and purpose of the
1890 Treaty and does not deal at all with the context in which the term
“main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” is used in that
Treaty (Judgment, paras. 43-45). Object and purpose of the Treaty in
which the term to be interpreted finds itself and the context in which the
term has been used, are important elements of treaty interpretation as
they throw light on the intentions of the Parties which are a key factor for
treaty interpretation as foreseen by the Vienna Convention. An interpre-
tation of the term “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses”,
which properly takes into account the object and purpose of the Treaty
and the context in which this term is used in Article ITI (2), leads to a
result that is different from the one reached by the Court in its Judgment.

Object and Purpose of the 1890 Treaty

5. As to object and purpose of the 1890 Treaty, I would like to first
observe that the 1890 Treaty is a bilateral treaty and that, as is often the
case with bilateral treaties, object and purpose pursued with the Treaty
by its parties follow fairly clearly from its text. The object of the 1890
Treaty were the spheres of influence of the two contracting parties in
Africa and the purpose was their agreed delimitation (Arts. I-IV of the
Treaty) in order to secure the respect by each of the parties of the sphere
of the other (Art. VII). Although the delimitations provided for in the
Treaty have evolved to become existing boundaries between African
States, including the boundary between Namibia and Botswana, the
Treaty has not to be regarded as a boundary treaty in the technical sense;
the Treaty was meant to keep the political relations between the two con-
tracting States undisturbed by rivalry in Africa. This cannot be over-
looked in its interpretation; the Treaty must not be understood as mean-
ing a comprehensive settlement of all questions regarding the actual
course of the delimitations it establishes. It seems quite compatible with
the Treaty’s object and purpose that, in certain places, it sets forth only in
broad lines where the delimitation of the spheres of interests runs but
leaves the fixation of its course in detail to the future application of the
Treaty.

The Context in Which the Term “Main Channel of That
River”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” Is Used in Article III (2) of the
1890 Treaty

7. The context in which the terms of a treaty are used is necessarily
connected with the object and purpose of the treaty itself. That does not
mean, however, that the context is always identical with, or indistinguish-
able from, object and purpose of the treaty. The context in which a term
is used in a treaty may relate to the overall realization of the object and
purpose of the treaty; but the context may as well concern the realization
of a particular feature or aspect of the treaty. This is the case with the
term “main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in
Article 111 (2) of the 1890 Treaty.

The Error of the Parties to the 1890 Treaty in the Appreciation of the
Possible Uses of the Chobe River

9. In placing hopes in the expected navigational use of the Chobe
River, the parties were in error; the context in which they perceived the
“main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” was unreal. We
know now, more than hundred years after the conclusion of the Treaty,
that the river has not been used, and is not usable, for larger-scale navi-
gation. This is mainly due to the fact that if there was a fully navigable
part of the Chobe, it would run from nowhere to nowhere, ie. from
some point upstream from Kasikili/Sedudu Island to the point where —
downstream from the Island — the Mambova Rapids block navigation.
But also the particular hydrological conditions prevailing in the Chobe in
the area around Kasikili/Sedudu Island would not permit full naviga-
tional use of the river there. This is supported by the fact that while
an attempt at lumber floating was undertaken by Mr. Ker in 1947-1948,
the Court has not been informed that this attempt was repeated after
Mr. Ker’s first experience. The Zambezi Queen is not operated on a regu-
lar schedule but is moored in the northern channel as a floating hotel.
The only navigational activity which has ever, in a sustained way, been
carried out on the River Chobe, is the operation of the tourist flatboats
that has taken place, for some time now, mainly in the southern chan-
nel, as the Island is becoming known as a major wildlife feeding ground
readily accessible to safe viewing by tourists who mainly come from
Botswana. The parties to the Treaty were thus in error when they drafted
the Treaty in the expectation of larger-scale navigational usability of the
Chobe, in particular in giving access to the Zambezi.

The error with which the Court is confronted here is not an error “in a
treaty” as dealt with by Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties, which one State party to the treaty wishes to invoke “as
invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty”. It is rather an error in
motivation which led to the use of the term “main channel of that river”/
“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in Article III (2) of the 1890 Treaty, an error
made by both parties to the Treaty. The question that arises does not
concern the validity of the consent to be bound by the Treaty; the error
rather raises the question whether a mistaken expectation of the parties
when they drew up the Treaty can still serve, more than 100 years after
the conclusion of the Treaty and a long time after the error has become
clear, in the interpretation of the Treaty.



In the circumstances of the present case, the interpretation of the term
“main channel”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” based on the mistaken expec-
tation of large-scale navigational usability of the Chobe cannot be held
against Namibia because that would mean that Namibia alone would be
burdened with the consequences of the error. The flatboat navigation
connected to the tourist activities that have evolved on and around
Kasikili/Sedudu Island is concentrated in the southern channel. Interpre-
tation of the term “the main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses
Flusses” in favour of the northern channel would deprive Namibia from
having an equitable share in the only navigational use of the Chobe there
is to share. That would run directly counter to the intention of the parties
to split the river evenly. Therefore the interpretation of the term “main
channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in favour of the north-
ern channel would not be compatible with the principle of good faith
which, according to Article 31, paragraph |, of the Vienna Convention,
governs all treaty interpretation. Interpretation of the term “main chan-
nel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in favour of the southern
channel, however, would correspond to what the parties wanted to
achieve regarding the River Chobe. It would be a good faith interpreta-
tion of the term because it would split evenly between the Parties the only
channel that is of some navigational interest.

II. THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF THE DISPOSITIF OF THE JUDGMENT

10. The fact that the Court finds in the third paragraph of the disposi-
tif of its Judgment that

“in the two channels around Kasikili/Sedudu Island, the nationals
of, and vessels flying the flags of, the Republic of Botswana and the
Republic of Namibia shall enjoy equal national treatment”

does not fully overcome the shortcomings of interpreting the term
“main channel of that river”/“Hauptlauf dieses Flusses” in favour of the
northern channel. As far as the territorial status of the Island itself is



concerned, the third paragraph of the dispositif of the Judgment does not
affect the finding in the second paragraph of the dispositif that the Island
forms part of Botswana. As to the waters around the Island, conceding
equal national treatment to the nationals of the other Party and to boats
flying the flag of that Party, is not the same as the splitting of the “main
channel”/“Hauptlauf” of the Chobe around the Island, as originally
envisaged by the Parties.

However, the fact that I do not regard the third finding in the dispositif
of the Judgment as compensating for the erroneous decision in favour of
the northern channel, has not prevented me from voting in favour of that
finding. I agree with the reasons for the finding which are given in para-
graphs 100 and 103 of the Judgment and the attribution, in the channels
around Kasikili/Sedudu Island, of equal, national treatment to the nation-
als of both Parties and the boats flying their flags may be of some help to
the Parties and contribute to avoiding or lessening tensions.

11. As a final remark, I would like to add with regard to the role of
prescription in this case, that I agree with the conclusion of the Judgment
that acquisitive prescription does not play a role. I also agree with the
reasons given for that conclusion. However, there is an additional and
quite decisive reason why acquisitive prescription could not come into
play in this case.

As the Court states, Botswana and Namibia

“agree between themselves that acquisitive prescription is recognized
in international law and they further agree on the conditions under
which title to territory may be acquired by prescription, but their
views differ on whether those conditions are satisfied in this case”
(Judgment, para. 96).

“For present purposes, the Court need not concern itself with the
status of acquisitive prescription in international law or with the
conditions for acquiring title to territory by prescription. It considers
. . . that the conditions cited by Namibia itself are not satisfied in this
case and that Namibia's argument on acquisitive prescription there-
fore cannot be accepted.” (Judgment, para. 97.)



These conclusions are not objectionable in themselves. The Court
should however have gone into the conditions under which title to terri-
tory may be acquired by prescription, far enough to state that South
Africa could not have acquired title to the Island by prescription. South
Africa, whose presence in the Caprivi Strip including the Island lasted
longer than the presence there of Germany or Britain, prior to the termi-
nation of the Mandate by the General Assembly in 1966 exercised
authority there not à titre de souverain but à titre de mandataire. As
mandatory, South Africa certainly was vested by virtue of the Mandate
instrument of 17 December 1920 (League of Nations, Journal Officiel,
2nd Year, No. 1, p. 89) with the “full power of administration and legis-
lation over the territory subject to the present Mandate as an integral
portion of the Union of South Africa”; however, as the Court observes in
its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa
(I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 128, at p. 132):

“On the other hand, the Mandatory was to observe a number of
obligations, and the Council of the League was to supervise the
administration and see to it that these obligations were fulfilled.”

And the Court added:

“The terms of this Mandate, as well as the provisions of Article 22
of the Covenant and the principles embodied therein, show that the
creation of this new international institution did not involve any
cession of territory or transfer of sovereignty to the Union of South
Africa. The Union Government was to exercise an international
function of administration on behalf of the League, with the object
of promoting the well-being and development of the inhabitants.”
(Ibid.)

This perception of the nature of the Mandate is incompatible with
acquisitive prescription working in favour of the Mandatory. After the
termination of the Mandate, the continued presence of South Africa in
South West Africa (Namibia) was no longer “peaceful”, i.e., uncontested,
as is confirmed by Security Council resolution 276 (1970) and by the
Court’s Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the
Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa)
notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (LC J. Reports
1971, p. 16).

I agree that the present case is not a suitable occasion for the Court to
concern itself with the status of acquisitive prescription in international
law or with the general conditions under which title to territory may be
acquired by prescription. Nevertheless, in order to further clarify the law



governing mandates or trusteeships, a statement of the Court that acquisi-
tive prescription does not work in favour of a Mandatory would have

been desirable.
