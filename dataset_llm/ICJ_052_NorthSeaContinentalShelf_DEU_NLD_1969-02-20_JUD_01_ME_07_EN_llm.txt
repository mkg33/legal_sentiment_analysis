To my great regret, I am unable to concur in the Court's Judgment, for
the reasons which I state below.

The Judgment denies the possibility of applying Article 6, paragraph 2,
of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf to these cases on a
purely conventional basis. It is a fact that the Federal Republic of
Germany has not ratified the Convention. Therefore, despite the Fede-
ral Government's having recognized the doctrine of the continental
shelf as embodied in Articles | to 3 of the Convention, despite its
reliance thereon in proclaiming its sovereign rights over the con-
tinental shelf, despite its having announced a bill for ratification, and
despite its conclusion with the Netherlands and Denmark of respective
treaties that fix partial continental shelf boundaries following “to some
extent .. . the equidistance line” or adopting a “seaward terminus...
equidistant from’ the coasts concerned (Memorials, para. 60) and are
thus more than consistent with paragraph 2 of Article 6, the Federal
Republic of Germany has disputed the possibility of regarding that
provision as binding upon it. It may be noted that, during the negotia-
tions which took place with the Netherlands and Denmark, the Federal
Republic contested this possibility only after a certain delay, and that it
was not consistent in doing so, since it even assumed as an alternative
possibility in its final Submissions that the rule contained in the second
sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 6 could be applicable between the
Parties, adding that “special circumstances within the meaning of that
rule would exclude the application of the equidistance method in the
present case”. In this Submission (No. 2) the Federal Republic linked the
principle of equidistance (though calling it a ““method™) with the *‘special
circumstances” rule, and it may be recalled that, during the oral pro-
ceedings, Counsel for Denmark and the Netherlands had combined them
in the form of the “equidistance special-circumstances™ rule.

The Judgment acknowledges that “such a rule was embodied in Article
6 of the Convention, but as a purely conventional rule” (paragraph 69).
However, as the Federal Republic has not ratified the Convention, the



Judgment considers that “qua conventional rule . . . it is not opposable to
the Federal Republic of Germany” (ibid.). It may be regretted that the
Judgment did not deal fully with the question as to whether “special
circumstances’ could in fact be established with regard to the maritime
boundaries between the Federal Republic and the Netherlands, and
between the Federal Republic and Denmark, respectively.

In its first finding, the Judgment uses the following words in respect of
each case: “(A) the use of the equidistance method of delimitation not
being obligatory as between the Parties.” It thus disjoins the equidistance
principle from the other two components of the triad: agreement-special
circumstances-equidistance. These three interconnected elements are
embodied in the Convention, as also in the Convention on the Territorial
Sea and the Contiguous Zone, and have entered into the province of the
general principles of international law, being consolidated as a combined
principle of customary international law. Each of these three elements
plays its part in the determination of a boundary line between two
maritime areas, such as areas of the continental shelf in particular.

Agreement is deemed to constitute the principal and most appropriate
method of determining the boundaries of the areas of any continental
shelf. This is confirmed by the practice of States. The Convention itself
gives it pride of place, and this was quite natural, as the issue was one
concerning the geographical limits of the sovereign rights of States. It
was unnecessary to prescribe at that stage any directives as to the con-
siderations on the basis of which parties ought to arrive at agreement.
Provided there is no encroachment on the sphere of the sovereign rights
of any other State, parties are free to agree on whatever terms they wish
for the delimitation of boundaries, bearing in mind, generally, both legal
and non-legal considerations: relevant political and economic factors,
related considerations of security and topography, the relations (*‘good-
neighbourly” or otherwise) between the States concerned, and whatever
imponderables may escape hard and fast classification. The assessment
of such considerations is a political and subjective matter, and it is not
for the Court as a judicial organ to concern itself with it unless the parties
submit to it a dispute on a question or questions of a really legal character.

The next element of the triad—the “special circumstances” situation—
is, however, an objective matter, concerning as it does, for instance, the
unusual geographical configuration of the coastline to either side of a
frontier, and a disagreement as to whether or not a certain situation
could be regarded as a case of “special circumstances” justifying an
appropriate boundary line would be a justiciable dispute.

And it is only after the failure of these two elements of the triad, in
the event of a deadlock, that the third element—the equidistance prin-
ciple—makes its appearance as the last resort, offering a way out of the
impasse in a geometrical construction which introduces a mathematical



definitude and a certainty of maritime boundaries. The Judgment itself
agrees that “it would probably be true to say that no other method of
delimitation has the same combination of practical convenience and
certainty of application’ (paragraph 23).

If it be held that the principles and rules inseparably embodied in
paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Convention are no more than treaty
provisions and are not, as such, opposable to the Federal Republic,
then one may ask whether these principles and rules are or have become
an institution of international law, either as general principles developed
in relation to the continental shelf, or as an embodiment of international
custom. There are sufficient grounds for considering them to qualify in
both these ways, but I am inclined to consider them rather as principles
of general international law, seeing that established doctrine lays much
stress on the time factor as a criterion of whether a given principle belongs
to customary international law: by and large, customary international
law turns its face to the past while general international law keeps abreast
of the times, conveying a sense of today and the near future by absorbing
the basic progressive principles of international law as soon as they are
developed.

Contemporary international law has developed not only quantitatively
but more especially qualitatively.

There has been far-reaching development of the work of the codifica-
tion of international law which has been organized in the United Nations
on a hitherto unknown scale. In the first stage, drafts of international
multilateral conventions were prepared by the International Law Com-
mission, composed of jurists “of recognized competence in international
law”, which in response to its request, received numerous comments and
observations from almost all governments. There followed, upon the
themes of those drafts, an increased amount of special literature (books
or articles) and the work of universities and research institutes, including
the Institute of International Law, and various learned societies (e.g., the
International Law Association). Then came the discussions in the General
Assembly of the reports and drafts prepared by the International Law
Commission. This preparatory work led finally to the convocation of
special intergovernmental conferences in which the great majority of
States participated. The scale and thoroughness of this process for the
forming and formulation of principles and rules of international law
should lead to the consideration in a new light of what is accepted as the
result of such work of codification.

general principles of international law, to gather the relevant data brick
by brick, as it were, from governmental acts, declarations, diplomatic
notes, agreements and treaties, mostly on concrete matters, such prin-
ciples are now beginning to be crystallized by international conferences
which codify certain not inconsiderable areas of international law. Elihu
Root, the well-known jurist and statesman, one of the framers of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, wrote (in his
Prefatory Note to the Texts of the Peace Conferences at The Hague, 1899
and 1907, Boston 1908):

“The question about each international conference is not merely
what it has accomplished, but also what it has begun, and what it has
moved forward. Not only the conventions signed and ratified, but
the steps taken towards conclusions which may not reach practical
and effective form for many years to come, are of value.”

Elihu Root wrote this in connection with the Peace Conferences of 1899
and 1907. Certain principles which were embodied in The Hague Con-
ventions at that time have been acknowledged as principles of general
international law, though States have been slow to put them into practice.

The 1958 Conference on the Law of the Sea, with the Conventions
adopted there, among them the Convention on the Continental Shelf,
introduced substantial definitude in this field of international law; and
the principles and rules of the international law of the sea formulated
therein have become the general principles of that law with almost un-
precedented rapidity.

The rapid technical progress in the exploration and exploitation of
submarine oil and gas resources has entailed the necessity for correspond-
ing legal principles and rules. The practice of States has predetermined
the course of development of the doctrine as also of the principles and
rules of international law relating to the continental shelf.

The Anglo-Venezuelan Treaty Relating to the Submarine Areas of the
Gulf of Paria, 1942 (U.N. Legislative Series: Laws and Regulations on the
Régime of the High Seas, Vol. I (1951), p. 44) was followed in a com-
paratively short time by numerous unilateral governmental acts, such as
the Presidential Proclamation concerning the policy of the United States
with respect to the natural resources of the subsoil and seabed of the
continental shelf (1945), the Presidential Declaration (of Mexico) of the
same year with respect to the continental shelf, and decrees, laws and
declarations by almost all the other Latin American States (in the
period 1946-1951), and by the Arab States, Pakistan and others (U.N.
Legislative Series, Laws and Regulations on the Régime of the High Seas,
ST/LEG/SER.B/1).

right of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the natural resources
of the subsoil and seabed of the continental shelf, regarded that shelf “as
an extension of the land-mass of the coastal nation and thus naturally ap-
purtenant to it”. In 1946 an Argentine decree stated : “The continental shelf
is closely united to the mainland both in a morphological and a geological
sense.’ The Peruvian Presidential Decree of 1947 stated that “the continen-
tal submerged shelf forms one entire morphological and geological unit
with the continent”, and the decrees of almost all other Latin American
countries employ virtually identical expressions. (U.N. Legislative Series,
Laws and Regulations on the Régime of the High Seas, ST;LEG;/SER.B/1).
The Judgment also recognizes that the submarine areas of the continental
shelf” may be deemed to be actually part of the territory over which
the coastal State already has dominion—in the sense that, although
covered with water, they are a prolongation or continuation of that
territory, an extension of it under the sea” (paragraph 43).

But what conclusion can be drawn from this premise—in relation to
principles and rules of international law which govern or should govern
the delimitation of a given part of the continental shelf? Bearing in mind
that the continental shelf constitutes, as is stated in the operative part of
the Judgment, under (C) (1), “a natural prolongation of” each Party’s
“land territory into and under the sea” (including, may 1 add, the
territorial sea appertaining to the same coastal State), the question might
be asked as to whether there exist, for the delimitation of the continental
shelf as between “adjacent States, any special principles and rules
different from those which have been established (in State practice,
treaties, agreements, etc.) in relation to the delimitation of such maritime
areas as the territorial sea. Concerning any possible connection between
the conceivable principles—whether similar or different—governing the
delimitation, respectively, of the territorial sea and of the continental
shelf, it may be noted, in the first place, that the sovereign rights of a
coastal State over its territorial sea and over the continental shelf are
different in scope.

In relation to the territorial sea three “strata” (to use that term) may
be distinguished: (a) the maritime area, (b) the seabed and its subsoil and
{c) the air-space. The sovereignty of a coastal State extends to all three of
these strata with regard to the territorial sea adjacent to its coast.

In relation to a contiguous zone the coastal State has ceitain rights
in connection with a delimited maritime area.

In relation to the continental shelf, that is to say, to the seabed and
subsoil of submarine areas adjacent to a given coast, but outside the
area of the territorial sea (ergo, submarine areas of the contiguous zone
included), the coastal State has “sovereign rights for the purpose of
exploring it and exploiting its natural resources”, not affecting “the
legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the air-
space above these waters”.

Thus, there has occurred some kind of bifurcation of the legal régimes
of the territorial sea and of the continental shelf. The maritime and air
“strata” over the continental shelf are outside the sphere of the rights
of a given coastal State. But the continental shelf itself is within the
sphere of the special territorial (though limited) rights of the coastal
State to which it is appurtenant, on the ground of the close physical
relationship of the continental shelf with the mainland (via the submarine
area of its territorial sea), as being its natural prolongation, as was
recognized by the Court and has become the generally recognized concept
of international law. Although Bracton might have considered the sea
coast “quasi maris accessorid”, which was historically understandable,
not only the territorial sea but also the continental shelf may now be
considered as “accessories” of or, in the words of the Judgment in the

- Fisheries case, as “appurtenant to the land territory” (Z.C.J. Reports
1951, p. 128; in French, more explicitly, “comme accessoire du territoire



terrestre”) !. To apply the old adage accessorium sequitur suum principale,
this appurtenance may be considered as entailing common principles for
the delimitation of maritime spaces, that is to say for both the territorial
sea and the continental shelf.

This explains why, in the International Law Commission, almost
from the beginning, it was frequently said that the question of the delimi-
tation of the continental shelf is, in the words of M. Cordova, a former
Judge of the International Court, “closely bound up with the delimitation
of territorial waters” (7.L.C. Yearbook, 1951, Vol. 1, p. 289).

The starting-point for determining the boundaries of a continental
shelf is formed by the definitive boundaries of the territorial sea of a
given State (Article 1 of the Convention on the Continental Shelf defines
the continental shelf, as has been recalled, as adjacent to the coast but
outside the area of the territorial sea), and it was for that reason that
Professor Frangois, the rapporteur of the International Law Commission,
was able to state as follows in 1951:

“Tt seems reasonable to accept, as demarcation line between the
continental shelves of two neighbouring States, the prolongation of
the line of demarcation of the territorial waters” (A/CN.4/42, p. 717).

The Committee of Experts, which was composed not of mere draftsmen
but of very experienced specialists acquainted with the practice of States
in the matter of the determination and delimitation of maritime bound-
aries, who were the representatives of cartography as a science within
the field of political geography which is intimately connected with “public
law”, stated in their report, in answer to, inter alia, the question of how
the lateral boundary line should be drawn through the territorial sea of
two adjacent States:

“The committee considered it important to find a formula for
drawing the international boundaries in the territorial waters of
States, which could also be used for the delimitation of the respective
continental shelves of two States bordering the same continental
shelf” (A/CN.4/61, Add. 1, Annex, p. 7).


If both the territorial sea and the continental shelf are regarded as a
natural prolongation of a given mainland and if, in this sense, it is
considered that they have a territorial character, it must be still borne
in mind that their dclimitation should be effected not in accordance with
the principles and rules applicable to the delimitation of land territories
themselves, but in accordance with those applicable to the delimitation
of maritime areas covering such a prolongation of a territory.

Until recently, attention was mainly directed to the delimitation of the
territorial sea and contiguous zone and, to some extent, of the continental
shelf, in a seaward direction, since the complexities of inter-State relations
and contradictions gave rise to problems concerning the correlation of the
freedom of the high seas with the sovereignty of coastal States over their
territorial sea and, associated therewith, problems of navigation, innocent
passage, fisheries, etc. Questions of policy and, in the words of Article 24
of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone,
questions concerning the prevention of infringements of a given State’s
customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations, committed within its
territory, or within its territorial sea, gave rise to certain problems con-
cerning lateral boundaries. When the exploitation of the natural resources
of the subsoil of the sea became a real possibility, and the problems
connected with the delimitation of the continental shelf area not only
in a seaward direction but more especially between neighbouring States
whose continental shelf is adjacent to their coasts, became more acute,
the character of the “territoriality” of the sovereign rights of a coastal
State called for more certainty and more definiteness and almost, indeed,
for mathematical precision.

Inevitably, the definition of the boundary of a given part of the con-
tinental shelf must be effected not on the shelf itself but on the waters
which cover it. This entails the application to the delimitation of the
continental shelf of principles and rules appropriate to the delimitation

! It may also be noted that the delegate of the Federal Republic of Germany to
the Geneva Conference of 1958, Professor Miinch, declared that he was in agreement
with the wording of Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, ‘’subject to an interpretation of
the words ‘special circumstances’ as meaning that any exceptional delimitation of the
territorial waters would affect the delimitation of the continental shelf” (U.N.
Conference on the Law of the Sea, Official Records, VI, 4th Committee, p. 98).


in the actual drawing of the line but without, of course, substituting an
alternative basis of delimitation.

the Common Law countries. It states: “Whatever the legal reasoning of a
court of justice, its decisions must by definition be just, and therefore
in that sense equitable” (paragraph 88). Any judge might be pleased
with this statement, but the point it makes appears to me purely semantic.
The International Court is a court of law. Its function is to decide disputes
submitted to it “in accordance with international law” (Statute, Article
38, paragraph 1), and on no other grounds. It is true that the Court may
be given “power . . . to decide a case ex aequo et bono”, but only “if the
parties agree thereto” (ibid., paragraph 2). It might be held that in such
circumstances the Court would be discharging the functions of an
arbitral tribunal, but the measure of discretion which the ex aequo et bono
principle confers upon a court of law as such is at all events something
which the International Court of Justice has never enjoyed. This principle
is accordingly nowhere to be found in the decisions either of the present
Court or of its predecessor, because there never has been any case in
which the parties agreed that the Court might decide ex aequo et bono.

! À typical attitude is expressed in the following extract from a letter addressed
by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the International Law Commission on
2 August 1953: “If , . . the International Law Commission were to deem indispens-
able a choice between the three definitions’ it has ‘‘proposed, the French Govern-
ment considers that delimitation by means of a line every point of which is equidistant
from the nearest points on the coastline of each of the two adjacent States should be
chosen, as being likely to yield the best solution in the greatest number of cases”
[translation by the Registry] (Doc. A/CN./4/71/Add.2: I.L.C. Yearbook, 1953,
Vol. H, pp. 88 {., in fine).



This negative fact seems to indicate that States are somewhat averse to
resorting to this procedure ! and it was not on this basis that the Court
was asked to give a decision in the present case. The Court itself states in
its Judgment that “Thereis. . . no question in this case of any decision ex
aequo et bono (paragraph 88); nevertheless it may be thought to have
tended somewhat in that direction.

The notion of equity was long ago defined in law dictionaries, which
regard it as a principle of fairness bearing a non-juridical, ethical charac-
ter. Black, for example, cites: “Its obligation is ethical rather than jural
and its discussion belongs to the sphere of morals. It is grounded in the
precepts of the conscience, not in any sanction of positive law” (4th
edition, 1951, p. 634) 2. The science of ethics has been and still is the
subject of somewhat heated debates and of ideological differences
concerning the content and meaning of equity and of what is equitable.
1 feel that to introduce so vague a notion into the jurisprudence of the
International Court may open the door to making subjective and there-
fore at times arbitrary evaluations, instead of following the guidance of
established general principles and rules of international law in the settle-
ment of disputes submitted to the Court. Thus the question of the actual
size of the area of continental shelf which would fall to the Federal Repub-
lic on application of the equidistance principle is not in itself relevant for
the present cases, where the issues raised are, in the words of Lord
McNair, “issues which can only be decided on a basis of law” (Fisheries,
dissenting opinion, /.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 158).

To demonstrate the necessity for applying the rule of equity, reference

The Court, rejecting the application of the equidistance method? in
these cases and observing that there is no other single method of delimi-
tation the use of which is in all circumstances obligatory 3, has found
that “delimitation is to be effected by agreement in accordance with
equitable principles” (Judgment, paragraph 101 (C) (1)) thus envisaging
new negotiations (even though, before they requested the Court to
decide the dispute between them, the Parties had already carried on
somewhat protracted but unsuccessful negotiations).

At the same time, the Court has considered it necessary to indicate
“the factors to be taken into account” by the Parties in their negotiations
(paragraph 101 (D)). The factors which have been specified could
hardly, in my opinion, be considered among the principles and rules of
international law which have to be applied in these cases. The word
“factor” indicates something of a non-juridical character that does not
come ‘within the domain of law”. The Court has put forward considera-
tions that are, rather, economico-political in nature, and has given some
kind of advice or even instructions; but it has not given what I personally
conceive to be a judicial decision consonant with the proper function of
the International Court.

It may be appropriate to recall in this connection the observation
made by Judge Kellogg in the Free Zones case to the effect that the
Court could not “decide questions upon grounds of political and econo-
mic expediency” (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 24, 1930, p. 34). Interpreting
Article 38 of the Statute, he noted that “it is deemed impossible to avoid
the conclusion that this Court is competent to decide only such questions
as are susceptible of solution by the application of rules and principles of

! Italics supplied.

2 The Convention speaks of the equidistance principle but the Court uses the
term ‘‘equidistance method”, thereby reducing the significance of the principle to
that of a technical means.

3 It may be noted that the Court was asked to indicate not a method of delimitation
which could be applied in any or all circumstances, but the principles and rules of
international law which are applicable in the circumstances that were indicated in
these cases and referred to in the Special Agreements.

Although I feel obliged to disagree with the whole of section (C) of the
operative part of the Judgment, I consider it necessary to refer here only
to sub-paragraph (2) of that section; in which the Court, envisaging a
case where “the delimitation leaves to the Parties areas that overlap”,
decides that such areas “are to be divided between them in agreed pro-
portions or, failing agreement, equally 2’. Here, the Judgment goes
beyond the province of questions relating to the delimitation of the
continental shelf and enters upon that of questions of distribution,
despite the fact that the Court itself has earlier stated that “its task in
the present proceedings relates essentially to the delimitation and not the
apportionment of the areas concerned” (paragraph 18) 3.

In sum, I consider that the principles and rules of international law
enshrined in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Continental
Shelf ought to be applied in these cases at least qua general principles
and rules of international law.

But even if one does not agree that this provision is applicable in these
cases in its entirety or in part, it is nevertheless necessary that the prin-



ciples and rules which are applied in the delimitation of a lateral boundary
of the continental shelf should have a natural connection with the three
interconnected principles and rules—agreement, special circumstances,
equidistance—which determine the boundaries of a territorial sea.

For, considering that it is a continuation, a natural prolongation of the
territorial sea (its bed and subsoil), the continental shelf is not unlimited
in extent, whether seaward or laterally, but lies within limits consistently
continuing the boundary lines of the territorial sea in accordance with
the same principles, rules and treaty provisions as provided the basis for
the determination of the territorial sea between the two given adjacent
States; that is, in these cases, between the Netherlands and the Federal
Republic of Germany on the one hand and between Denmark and the
Federal Republic of Germany on the other.
