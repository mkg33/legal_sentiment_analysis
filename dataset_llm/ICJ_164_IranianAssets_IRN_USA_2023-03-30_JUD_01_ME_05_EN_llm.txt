       I agree with subparagraphs (1) and (9) of the operative paragraph 236 but disagree with the
remaining subparagraphs of that paragraph  As a jurisdictional matter, the Court should have
determined which of the USA’s impugned measures and judicial proceedings are relevant to its
analysis of the case  Iran’s claims pursuant to Articles III, IV and V of the 1955 Treaty are
inadmissible in as far as they relate to Iranian companies that failed to exhaust local remedies in the
USA  The obligations under Articles III and IV of the 1955 Treaty are distinct and should not be
conflated  United States courts are entitled, in the interests of justice, to lift the corporate veil of
Iranian State-owned companies  Iran has not established that the USA denied Iranian companies
fair and equitable treatment, or subjected them to unreasonable or discriminatory measures or
impeded the enforcement of their contractual rights  Iran has not established that Executive
Order 13599 actually prevented Iranian companies from disposing their real property in the USA
within the meaning of Article IV (1)  The attachment of Iranian assets by the USA does not amount
to compensable “expropriation” within the meaning of Article IV (2)  Article VII (1) relates solely
to exchange restrictions and Iran has not established that the USA violated its obligation under that
Article  Iran has not established that there was ongoing commerce between the territories of Iran
and the USA that was impeded by the USA in violation of Article X (1)  Executive Order 13599
qualifies as a measure that is necessary to protect the security interests of the USA within the
meaning of Article XX (1) (d) and should be exempted from the scope of the 1955 Treaty  The USA
is under no obligation to compensate Iran.

       1. I have voted in favour of operative paragraphs (1) and (9) of paragraph 236 of the Judgment
because I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the Court in relation thereto. However, I have
voted against operative paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) thereof because I disagree with
the reasoning and conclusions of the Court in relation thereto. In this dissenting opinion, I give my
reasons for not voting with the majority. Where certain abbreviations, acronyms and short forms
have been used in the Judgment, I have adopted the same in this opinion, unless otherwise specified.

        2. I begin with a few preliminary issues that were not dealt with in the Judgment. Iran’s claims
for the alleged breach of Articles VII and X of the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and
Consular Rights between the United States of America and Iran, signed at Tehran on 15 August 1955
(“1955 Treaty”), are made in Iran’s own right as a State. However, Iran’s claims for the alleged
breach of Articles III, IV and V of the 1955 Treaty are diplomatic protection claims brought on behalf
of its “nationals” under a bilateral commercial treaty. Those claims concern the alleged violation of
the rights of Iranian State-owned companies, as well as the consequences that these violations have
had on Iran’s ability to trade with the United States of America (“United States”) as envisaged under
the 1955 Treaty. Iran claims that the legislative and executive measures adopted by the Respondent
since 2002 have “severely impeded” Iranian trade with or through foreign branches of the
Respondent’s companies, inter alia, because Iran cannot use the United States banking system for
international payments; and neither Iran nor Iranian financial institutions are able to use or dispose
of Iranian properties in the United States 1.

Respondent’s executive and legislative measures as well as judicial proceedings are relevant to the
determination of Iran’s claims on the merits, following the Court’s 2019 Judgment on preliminary
objections 2 (“2019 Judgment”). First, the provisions of the FSIA of 1996 3, including the amendments
thereto introduced in 2002 and 2008 which, according to Iran, violate its sovereign immunity or that
of its entities, relate solely to the removal of immunity from Iran and its agencies and
instrumentalities from legal and enforcement proceedings before United States courts 4. Iran’s claims
challenging these provisions were, in the 2019 Judgment, adjudged to fall outside the Court’s
jurisdiction ratione materiae 5.

      4. Notwithstanding its previous ruling on jurisdiction regarding the FSIA, the Court makes a
blanket statement in the present Judgment that,

         “[g]iven the combination of the legislative character of the contested measures and the
        primacy accorded to a more recent federal statute over the treaty in the jurisprudence of
        the United States, . . . in the circumstances of the present case, the companies in
        question had no reasonable possibility of successfully asserting their rights in the
        United States court proceedings” 6 (emphasis added).

In my respectful view, the Court should have made it clear this finding did not apply to Iran’s
sovereign immunity claims arising out of the impugned FSIA provisions, having previously ruled
that it lacked jurisdiction to do so.

       5. Similarly, the Court should have expressly excluded from its jurisdiction Iran’s claims
against the Respondent arising from the provisions of the National Defence Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020 (“NDAA of 2020”), as that law was enacted in December 2019 after the termination
of the 1955 Treaty. In sum, there are only three legislative and executive measures directly relevant
to the Court’s analysis, namely the 2002 TRIA; the 2012 ITRSHRA; and the 2012 Executive Order
13599.

      6. Furthermore, given the Court’s rejection of Iran’s sovereign immunity claims in its
2019 Judgment 7, it is necessary to determine which of the Respondent’s judicial proceedings
complained of by Iran are relevant to the Court’s analysis. In this regard, the cases listed in
Attachments 1 8 and 4 9 are irrelevant as they relate to Iran’s claims of sovereign immunity. Likewise,
the cases listed in Attachment 3 10 are not relevant as they were filed outside the United States.

       7. Regarding the defence based on the “doctrine of unclean hands” 13, I agree with the Court
that the United States has not shown a sufficiently close link or nexus between Iran’s claims under
the 1955 Treaty and the Applicant’s alleged wrongful conduct. The United States’ claims of
wrongful conduct of Iran, including its alleged sponsorship and support of international terrorism,
and its presumed actions in respect of nuclear non-proliferation, are not reciprocal to the obligations
under the 1955 Treaty that Iran seeks to enforce. Indeed, the Court explained as much in its
2019 Judgment 14, where it rejected  on similar grounds  the largely identical argument raised by
the United States as a preliminary objection to admissibility. I therefore agree with the conclusion of
the Court in paragraphs 82-84 of the present Judgment.


       8. Similarly, I agree that the Court should reject the United States’ defence based on Iran’s
alleged abuse of rights. The abuse of rights doctrine applies in circumstances where a right is
exercised by a State for a purpose other than that for which the right was created 15. Assuming
arguendo that the United States’ terrorism allegations against Iran have any bearing on the issue, that
conduct does not, in my view, appear sufficient to dismiss Iran’s claim based on a valid title of
jurisdiction. I agree with the Court’s conclusion in paragraph 93 that the United States has not met
the high threshold required to establish Iran’s alleged abuse of rights.

      9. The United States does not dispute that Iran’s claims pursuant to Articles VII and X of the
1955 Treaty are made in Iran’s own right as a State and therefore do not require the exhaustion of

local remedies before the seisin of the Court 16. However, it argues that the exhaustion of local
remedies requirement is applicable to Iran’s claims pursuant to Articles III, IV and V of the
1955 Treaty, an argument disputed by Iran. In relation to the requirement for the exhaustion of local
remedies, I disagree with the conclusion of the Court that the Iranian companies in question did not
have any effective means of redress that they failed to pursue, in the legal system of the United States
(Judgment, paras. 67, 73 and 236 (2)), along with the reasons underlying that conclusion. In line with
the test laid down in Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy) 17, the first
issue for determination is whether Iran’s claims for diplomatic protection are interdependent with its
own rights under the 1955 Treaty and thus do not require those companies to exhaust local remedies,
or whether they are in fact claims that are not interdependent with the rights of Iran, in which case
they would require the prior exhaustion of local remedies.


       10. Articles III, IV and V of the 1955 Treaty, by their terms, protect only the rights of the
companies of the High Contracting Parties and do not provide direct rights to those States. In its
pleadings and arguments, Iran more than merely asserts a general claim that the 1955 Treaty has been
violated: it claims that specific Iranian companies have had their rights violated and that the
United States must provide reparation for the specific assets of those companies seized pursuant to
the allegedly wrongful conduct of Iran. It does not discuss harm caused to the Iranian State as such.
Thus, while the Court declined to expressly apply the test laid down in Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.
(ELSI) 18, I am of the view that Iran’s claims made under Articles III, IV and V of the 1955 Treaty
were brought on behalf of Iranian State-owned companies solely for the diplomatic protection of
their rights and are not interdependent with the rights of Iran under the Treaty. Consequently, the
Iranian State-owned entities in respect of which Iran has brought these claims are required, under
customary international law, to have exhausted local remedies in the United States before the seisin
of the Court, unless it can be shown that the “futility” or “ineffectiveness” exception 19 to the local
remedies rule applies.


       11. Article 14 (1) of the International Law Commission’s 2006 Articles on Diplomatic
Protection (“ILC Articles”) states that “[a] State may not present an international claim in respect to
an injury to a national . . . before the injured person has, subject to draft article 15, exhausted all local
remedies” 20. Furthermore, Article 15 (a) of the ILC Articles provides that local remedies need not be
exhausted where “the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of . . . redress” 21 (for example,
where the local court has no jurisdiction over the dispute in question; or where local courts are
notoriously lacking in independence; or where there is a consistent and well-established line of
precedents adverse to the claimant). However, as the ILC recognized in its commentary to this
Article, for the exception to apply,

        “[i]t is not sufficient for the injured person to show that the possibility of success is low
        or that further appeals are difficult or costly. The test is not whether a successful

       outcome is likely or possible, but whether the municipal system of the respondent State
       is reasonably capable of providing effective relief.” 22


       12. In the present case, Iran has not produced any evidence impugning the competence or
independence of the United States court system as such or establishing a consistent and
well-established line of precedents adverse to the claimants23. Moreover, the fact that some entities
whose assets were attached on grounds of terrorism successfully challenged the attachment in those
courts (a fact acknowledged by the Court 24) is, in my view, sufficient to preclude a conclusion that
the negative outcomes in the Peterson, Bennett and Weinstein cases necessarily meant that Iranian
State-owned companies had “no reasonable prospect of redress” in other cases. In my view, what is
relevant is not whether a successful or favourable outcome for the Iranian companies was likely or
possible, but whether the municipal system of the United States is reasonably capable of providing
effective relief. I disagree with the conclusion of the Court that “the companies in question did not
have any effective means of redress, in the legal system of the United States, that they failed to
pursue” 25. The exception of futility or ineffectiveness does not apply. Consequently, any Iranian
State-owned company that chose not to participate in the United States proceedings in which its
assets were the subject of attachment failed to exhaust local remedies, and Iran’s claims in relation
thereto are, in my view, inadmissible 26. Accordingly, the United States’ objection to the admissibility
of Iran’s claims based on the failure of Iranian State-owned companies to exhaust local remedies
should have been upheld.

       13. I voted against the finding of the Court in paragraph 236 (3) because I am not convinced
that the United States has violated its obligations under Article III, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty.
The obligation imposed by Article III, paragraph 1, upon each contracting party to recognize in its
territory the distinct corporate or legal personality of a company incorporated in the territory of the
other party, is distinct from the obligations of reasonableness and non-discrimination imposed by
Article IV, paragraph 1. In my respectful view, the Court should not have conflated the distinct
obligations arising under the two provisions as it appears to have done in the Judgment 27.




       22 ILC Articles, UN doc. A/61/10, 2006, p. 48.

        23 In this regard, I disagree with the majority’s reading and interpretation  as found in paragraphs 70-72 of the

Judgment  of the Weinstein and Bennett decisions by the Respondent’s domestic courts. Those courts clearly found that
there was no conflict between the 1955 Treaty and the applicable subsequent legislation, and accordingly did not have to
use the legislation to override the said Treaty.

Judgment, para. 71.
       25 Judgment, para. 67.

       26 It is not clear from Iran’s pleadings which of the Iranian State-owned companies have or have not exhausted

local remedies. Iran merely lists in Attachment 2 a list of enforcement actions, without indicating the parties to those
proceedings or the procedural status of the actions. Similarly, the new list provided during the oral proceedings lacks the
requisite clarity. Be that as it may, the onus remains on Iran to demonstrate, in respect of each company, that it exhausted
local remedies, before its claims can be entertained.
         27 See paragraph 159 of the Judgment where without much prior analysis of the alleged violation of Article III (1),

the Court simply concludes: “In light of all of the foregoing, the Court also concludes that the United States has violated
its obligation to recognize the juridical status of Iranian companies under Article III, paragraph 1.”

                                                        -6-

        14. So what is the nature and extent of the obligation created or envisaged under Article III,
paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty? The provision, read in its context and in light of the object and
purpose of the Treaty 28, ordinarily means that the United States and Iran each has a duty to recognize
in its territory the juridical status (distinct corporate or legal personality) of a company incorporated
in the territory of the other party. However, the obligation is not absolute and, as stipulated in the
second sentence of that Article, the recognition of a company’s juridical status “does not of itself
confer rights upon companies to engage in the activities for which they are organized”. Thus, the
United States, in recognizing the corporate or juridical status of Iranian companies in its territory, is
not obliged to grant to those companies the full range of rights to which they may be entitled under
Iranian law, and vice versa.


       15. This narrow reading of Article III (1) is confirmed by the 1955 Treaty’s travaux
préparatoires 29. Specifically, an internal United States State Department cable explained that
Article III (1) “merely provides [for the] recognition [of corporations] as corporate entities
principally in order they may prosecute or defend their rights as corporate entities” 30. This statement
was subsequently conveyed by representatives from the United States Government to the Iranian
Foreign Secretary 31. The travaux support the understanding that Article III (1) was intended to enable
the companies of each party to access the courts of law, and to perform such functions as enforcing
contracts, holding property and collecting debts, in the territory of the other. In the present case, the
United States indisputably recognized the legal status of Iranian companies as distinct legal entities
for purposes of litigation in domestic courts. As the Court itself noted in the Judgment 32, the rights
of Iranian companies to appear before United States courts, make legal submissions and lodge
appeals were not curtailed. Indeed, the very existence of the attachment proceedings challenged by
Iran — which involved lawsuits initiated by plaintiffs against Iranian companies as separate legal
entities — demonstrate the compliance of the United States with Article III (1).


       16. However, while it is a well-established principle in company law to distinguish the juridical
status of a company from that of its individual shareholders, there is also a well-established exception
in both common law and civil law domestic jurisdictions known as the “piercing or lifting of the
corporate veil”, whereby courts go behind the legal personality of the company and proceed against
the assets of individual shareholders “in the interests of justice”. This practice has also been applied
in international law in Barcelona Traction where the Court stated as follows:

              “Forms of incorporation and their legal personality have sometimes not been
       employed for the sole purposes they were originally intended to serve; sometimes the
       corporate entity has been unable to protect the rights of those who entrusted their
       financial resources to it; thus inevitably there have arisen dangers of abuse, as in the
       case of many other institutions of law. Here, then, as elsewhere, the law, confronted
       with economic realities, has had to provide protective measures and remedies in the
       interests of those within the corporate entity as well as of those outside who have
       dealings with it: the law has recognized that the independent existence of the legal entity
       cannot be treated as an absolute. It is in this context that the process of ‘lifting the
       corporate veil’ or ‘disregarding the legal entity’ has been found justified and equitable
       in certain circumstances or for certain purposes. The wealth of practice already

       accumulated on the subject in municipal law indicates that the veil is lifted, for instance,
       to prevent the misuse of privileges of legal personality, as in certain cases of fraud or
       malfeasance, to protect third persons such as a creditor or purchaser, or to prevent the
       evasion of legal requirements or of obligations.

             In accordance with the principle expounded above, the process of lifting the veil,
       being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law . . ., is equally admissible to play a
       similar role in international law.” 33

In my view, the domestic courts of the United States were entitled to lift the corporate veil of Iranian
State-owned companies in the interests of justice (namely, for the purposes of enforcing various
judgments obtained against the Iranian State), in order to access the assets of the Iranian State as a
shareholder in those companies. In the circumstances, Iran has failed to establish that the
United States violated its obligation owed to Iran under Article III (1).

and protection from unlawful expropriation. It appears that the parties understood these to be terms
of art when drafting the Treaty. There is also limited jurisprudence applying similar standards present
in other bilateral commercial treaties concluded by the United States with other States around the
same period.

1. Alleged violation of Article IV, paragraph 1

        19. In its ordinary meaning read in the context of the rest of the 1955 Treaty, Article IV,
paragraph 1, consists of three separate clauses, each separated with a semicolon and beginning with
the word “shall”. This suggests an intention to incorporate three distinct obligations. This
interpretation is also supported by the Treaty’s negotiating history 36. The first strand of Article IV,
paragraph 1, sets out a free-standing “fair and equitable treatment” standard (“FET standard”) that
contains no express reference to customary international law. Accordingly, the Court should interpret
this first strand as prescribing an autonomous FET standard that need not correspond precisely with
the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. The Parties agree that the
FET standard prohibits denial of justice, by promoting respect for fair procedure and due process 37.


       20. The second strand of Article IV, paragraph 1, sets out the prohibition against
“discriminatory or unreasonable treatment”. For treatment to be deemed “discriminatory”, the
claimant must demonstrate that similarly situated companies were subject to differential treatment
without reasonable or justifiable cause 38. The standard of “unreasonableness” is largely equivalent
to that of “arbitrariness” 39. Evaluating whether a given measure is unreasonable or arbitrary requires
reviewing the measure’s stated purpose, determining the legitimacy of that purpose and assessing
whether the measure bears a reasonable relationship with that purpose 40.


       21. Regarding the obligation encapsulated in the third strand of Article IV, paragraph 1,
investment tribunals have generally interpreted the “effective means” provisions as being similar to
the obligations to provide due process and to refrain from denial of justice 41. Such a requirement
could be breached, for example, by the failure to ensure the presence of legislation and secondary
rules of procedure that facilitate the enforcement of contractual rights through the legal system42 or


        36 A document memorializing discussions between representatives of the United States and Iran notes that the

United States rejected an Iranian proposal to replace the term “unreasonable and discriminatory” in Article IV (1) with the
term “unlawful and discriminatory”. Aide-memoire of the US Embassy in Tehran dated 20 November 1954, p. 3 (MI,
Ann. 3). The United States explained that the clause was intended to express a “general requirement for careful regard . . .
for legitimate interests of foreign investors without interference with the country’s right of proper regulation”. Ibid. This
suggests that the United States understood at the time that the separate clauses of Article IV (1) imposed their own distinct
standards of treatment.

Tribunal that the plain meaning of the terms ‘unreasonable’ and ‘arbitrary’ is substantially the same in the sense of
something done capriciously, without reason.” In ELSI, the Court explained that concept of arbitrariness is distinct from
illegality under domestic law: “It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a
sense of juridical propriety”. See Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy), Judgment, I.C.J.

by undue delays in local proceedings 43. I will address the alleged violations of each of the three
obligations or protections guaranteed by the provision, in turn.


(a) Alleged lack of fair and equitable treatment of Iranian companies

      22. Iran claims that the United States, by enforcing adverse retrospective legislation, has
deprived Iranian companies of their right to raise certain defences, resulting in a denial of justice and
a violation of due process 44. The obligation to afford due process, by its nature, encompasses
predominantly procedural obligations. It generally does not concern itself with the merits (or lack
thereof) of the substantive claims at issue, but with access to the courts, delays in court proceedings
or manifestly unjust applications of the law. As already discussed above, Iran has, in my view, not
provided any evidence of due process violations by United States domestic courts. Iranian
State-owned companies were provided the opportunity to defend their rights in United States courts
as part of the execution proceedings brought against them. Besides, Iran has not alleged that
United States courts manifestly failed to properly apply the applicable law.


(b) Alleged discriminatory or unreasonable treatment

       23. The obligation to refrain from discriminatory and unreasonable measures provides Iran
with the most plausible basis for its claim that the United States has violated Article IV, paragraph 1,
of the 1955 Treaty. Each of the measures challenged by Iran will be examined in turn.

(a) Section 502 of the 2012 ITRSHRA: This provision specifically targeted the assets of Bank
    Markazi and rendered them subject to attachment and execution for the purpose of satisfying
    default judgments against Iran in the Peterson case 45. Bank Markazi unsuccessfully challenged
    the validity of the provision before United States courts, as well as its constitutionality before the
    United States Supreme Court 46. In view of the Court’s findings that claims relating to the
    treatment accorded to Bank Markazi fall outside the jurisdiction of the Court, Iran’s claim of
    alleged discriminatory or unreasonable treatment based on the ITRSHRA cannot succeed.

(b) The 2002 TRIA and 2008 Amendments to the FSIA: These provisions (whose effects are similar) 47
    were not discriminatory in as far as they did not apply to Iranian companies only, but also to
    entities belonging to several other States that were also designated by the United States as “State
    sponsors of terrorism”, including, at the time, North Korea, Cuba, Syria and Sudan. Regarding
    Iran’s argument that the United States was unreasonable or arbitrary in applying its policy of
    corporate veil piercing, as well as its enforcement of the TRIA and the FSIA to individual Iranian
    State-owned companies not responsible for Iran’s impugned conduct, I refer to the quotation in
    Barcelona Traction referred to earlier in this opinion. In the present case, the veil was lifted,
    according to the Respondent, to prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality, to
    protect third persons that had obtained default judgments against the State of Iran (a shareholder
    in the companies), and to prevent Iran as well as other “State sponsors of terrorism” from evading

      44 RI, para. 6.60.

      45 Subsection 502 (b) of the Act specifically defined the property subject to the Act as


      “the financial assets that are identified in and the subject of proceedings in the United States District Court
      for the Southern District of New York in Peterson et al. v. Islamic Republic of Iran et al., Case No. 10
      Civ. 4518 . . . that were restrained by restraining notices and levies secured by the plaintiffs in those
      proceedings, as modified by court order dated June 27, 2008, and extended by court orders dated June 23,
      2009, May 10, 2010, and June 11, 2010, so long as such assets remain restrained by court order.”

    compensating victims of terrorist attacks. The enforcement of the TRIA and the FSIA followed
    similar objectives as those underlying corporate veil piercing. In the premises, Iran’s claim that
    the 2002 TRIA and 2008 Amendments to the FSIA were “unreasonable and arbitrary” and
    therefore violate Article IV, paragraph 1, cannot succeed.

(c) Executive Order 13599: This measure blocked or “froze” property in the United States belonging
    to the Government of Iran (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and Iranian financial
    institutions 48. Iran argues that the Order was both discriminatory and unreasonable. With respect
    to discrimination, the Executive Order by its terms targeted only the Government of Iran. On its
    face, this is suggestive of discriminatory treatment. However, the Order cannot be examined in
    isolation. In this regard, other United States measures have, at various times, frozen the assets of
    nationals of other States 49. Moreover, the United States has credibly argued that the money-
    laundering risks posed by the Iranian financial sector were not necessarily commensurate with
    the risks posed by banks of other States. Specifically, the Respondent points to 2011 findings by
    the Financial Actions Task Force (“FATF”) — an intergovernmental anti-money-laundering
    body — that Iran posed a particularly severe terrorism-financing risk, noting that Iran is one of
    only two jurisdictions (along with North Korea) against which the FATF has specifically called
    for States to take action 50. In the same vein, the United Nations Security Council stated in 2010
    that there was a need to “exercise vigilance” regarding Iranian financial institutions 51. In that
    context, it was rational for the United States to implement stricter measures against Iranian banks
    than against the financial sector of other States. Iran has provided no evidence of its own
    challenging the credibility of the Respondent’s contention that the Iranian financial sector posed
    a cumulative money-laundering risk. Accordingly, it appears that Iran has not met its burden to
    show that the Executive Order was arbitrary or unreasonable under the circumstances.
    Accordingly, Iran’s claim in this regard must also fail.


(c) Alleged lack of effective means of enforcement

       24. Iran contends that the United States measures have “rendered illusory” the contractual
rights of two Iranian entities, Bank Melli and TIC, to receive moneys owed by United States
companies because those funds were attached in execution proceedings. Iran’s claim that this
constituted a violation of Article IV, paragraph 1, is not very persuasive. As discussed above,
“effective means” obligations are generally interpreted as primarily concerning themselves with rules
of procedure, similar to the obligation regarding access to justice. The measures at issue did not
directly affect the procedural rights of Iranian State-owned companies to seek enforcement of their
contractual rights. Iranian companies retained access to the United States court system and the ability
to bring contractual claims therein although many chose not to do so.


       25. In my view, Iran has not established a violation by the United States of its obligation under
Article IV, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty, and Iran’s claims in this regard should have been
dismissed.

2. Alleged violation of Article IV, paragraph 2

      26. Article IV, paragraph 2, contains two protections: the first relating to the obligation to
provide “the most constant protection and security” and the second relating to the obligation not to
take property “without the prompt payment of just compensation” “except for a public purpose”.
With respect to the first of these protections, Article IV, paragraph 2, does not define the phrase
“most constant protection and security” (“MCPS”). Likewise, the travaux préparatoires of the
1955 Treaty shed little light on how that standard was understood by the Parties. However, the MCPS
obligation and related obligations, such as the obligation to ensure “full protection and security”
(“FPS”) 52, are present in a wide range of bilateral and multilateral investment agreements. Such
clauses have been traditionally understood as obligating the host State to ensure the physical
protections of the property of nationals or companies of the investor State.


      27. However, more recently, several investment tribunals have interpreted such clauses to also
extend to legal protections, in particular the existence of a secure legal environment 53. Arbitral
tribunals that have interpreted MCPS and FPS obligations to apply to legal security claims have
generally focused on the existence of a stable legal environment in the host State that provides the
investor with legal protections for their investment 54.


       28. The Parties agree that a “taking” of property under Article IV, paragraph 2, is equivalent
to expropriation, as understood in international law 55. This is also supported by the travaux of the
1955 Treaty 56. Expropriation is defined as the governmental taking of property for which
compensation is required 57. Expropriation usually takes the form of administrative or executive
action by the State. However, claims of expropriation based on conduct of a State’s judiciary require
an element of “illegality” or “arbitrariness” in the conduct of the State’s court system, such as conduct
amounting to denial of justice, for a judicial decision to qualify as an expropriation 58. It is also a
widely accepted norm of international law that a bona fide, non-discriminatory regulation, enacted
as an exercise of a State’s police powers, will not be deemed to be an expropriation 59. I will address
the alleged violations of each of the two obligations or protections guaranteed by Article IV,
paragraph 2, in turn.




       52 These different textual variations of the obligation have generally been interpreted similarly. See Frontier

(a) Alleged violation of the “most constant protection and security” obligation

      29. As discussed previously in the context of Iranian claims regarding violations of Article III,
paragraph 2, and Article IV, paragraph 1, the United States measures did not deprive Iranian
State-owned companies of access to the courts or result in a denial of justice or of effective means to
enforce their contractual rights. Those reasons are equally applicable to the alleged violation of the
most constant protection and security obligation (legal security). Based on the above reasons, I am
of the view that Iran has not proved that the impugned United States measures deprived Iranian
companies of legal security. Iran’s claim in this regard fails.


(b) Alleged expropriation of property belonging to Iranian State-owned companies

       30. Iran’s claim is essentially one of direct and unlawful expropriation. It contends that the
attachment of the assets of certain Iranian State-owned companies by United States courts and their
transfer to victims of terrorist attacks resulted in a taking of property without compensation in
violation of Article IV (2). As stated earlier, Iran’s claims of expropriation, with regard to measures
that solely affected Bank Markazi or Iran’s sovereign immunity, fall outside the Court’s jurisdiction.
Secondly, the challenged legislative and executive measures, in my view, amount to a bona fide,
non-discriminatory exercise of the United States police power aimed at achieving legitimate
regulatory purposes. Through those measures, the Respondent intended to provide victims of terrorist
attacks with the ability to obtain legal redress while, at the same time, addressing the national security
threats posed by Iran’s alleged arms trafficking and support for terrorism. Moreover, regarding the
effect of the impugned judicial decisions on the Applicant’s property, Iran has not provided any
evidence of “illegality” or “arbitrariness” in the conduct of the United States’ court system
amounting to judicial expropriation. Accordingly, the attachment by the United States of Iranian
assets, including those belonging to Iranian State-owned companies, does not amount to
compensable “expropriation” within the meaning of Article IV, paragraph 2. Iran’s claim in this
regard also fails.


       31. In my view, Iran has not established a violation by the United States of its obligation under
Article IV, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty.


                                     D. Alleged violations of Article VII

       36. I agree with the Court’s conclusion in paragraph 208 of the Judgment rejecting Iran’s claim
relating to the alleged violation by the United States of Article VII, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty.
I also agree with the Court’s interpretation of Article VII, paragraph 1, and would only add that the
negotiating history of the said provision confirms that interpretation. Iran does not refer to a single
instance in the provision’s negotiating history supporting its interpretation of Article VII (1).


                             E. Alleged violations of Article X, paragraph 1

       37. I respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the Court in paragraph 223 and its findings
in paragraph 236 (6) of the Judgment. Regarding the scope of this provision, the Court’s previous
interpretations of the scope of Article X, paragraph 1, in the Oil Platforms case and in the
2019 Judgment are highly relevant. In the Oil Platforms preliminary objection Judgment, the Court
stated:

              “The Court must indeed give due weight to the fact that, after Article X,
       paragraph 1, in which the word ‘commerce’ appears, the rest of the Article clearly deals
       with maritime commerce. Yet this factor is not, in the view of the Court sufficient to
       restrict the scope of the word to maritime commerce, having regard to other indications
       in the Treaty of an intention of the parties to deal with trade and commerce in general.
       The Court also takes note in this connection of the recital in Article XXII of the Treaty
       which states that the Treaty was to replace, inter alia, a provisional agreement relating

       61 Judgment, para. 200, referring to Executive Order 13599, Sec. 1.

        to commercial and other relations, concluded at Tehran on 14 May 1928. The Treaty of
        1955 is thus a Treaty relating to trade and commerce in general, and not one restricted
        purely to maritime commerce.

                ................................................................

              In these circumstances, the view that the word ‘commerce’ in Article X,
        paragraph 1, is confined to maritime commerce does not commend itself to the Court.

                ................................................................

               The Court must now consider the interpretation according to which the word
        ‘commerce’ in Article X, paragraph 1, is restricted to acts of purchase and sale.
        According to this interpretation, the protection afforded by this provision does not cover
        the antecedent activities which are essential to maintain commerce as, for example, the
        procurement of goods with a view to using them for commerce.

               In the view of the Court, there is nothing to indicate that the parties to the Treaty
        intended to use the word ‘commerce’ in any sense different from that which it generally
        bears. The word ‘commerce’ is not restricted in ordinary usage to the mere act of
        purchase and sale; it has connotations that extend beyond mere purchase and sale to
        include ‘the whole of the transactions, arrangements, etc., therein involved’ (Oxford
        English Dictionary, 1989, Vol. 3, p. 552).

              In legal language, likewise, this term is not restricted to mere purchase and sale
        because it can refer to

                ‘not only the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities, but also the
                instrumentalities and agencies by which it is promoted and the means and
                appliances by which it is carried on, and transportation of persons as well
                as of goods, both by land and sea’ (Black’s Law Dictionary, 1990, p. 269).

        Similarly, the expression ‘international commerce’ designates, in its true sense, ‘all
        transactions of import and export, relationships of exchange, purchase, sale, transport,
        and financial operations between nations’ and sometimes even ‘all economic, political,
        intellectual relations between States and between their nationals’ (Dictionnaire de la
        terminologie du droit international (produced under the authority of
        President Basdevant), 1960, p. 126 [translation by the Registry]).

              Thus, whether the word ‘commerce’ is taken in its ordinary sense or in its legal
        meaning, at the domestic or international level, it has a broader meaning than the mere
        reference to purchase and sale.

                ................................................................

               The Court concludes from al1 of the foregoing that it would be a natural
        interpretation of the word ‘commerce’ in Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of 1955
        that it includes commercial activities in general  not merely the immediate act of
        purchase and sale, but also the ancillary activities integrally related to commerce.”63




        63 Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 1996 (II), pp. 817-819, paras. 41, 43, 45, 49.

                                                        - 15 -

       38. According to the Court’s jurisprudence in Oil Platforms, the word “commerce” as used in
Article X (1) covers all forms of commercial transactions, including trade in services, as well as
financial transactions, and not merely the immediate act of purchase and sale.


       39. Moreover, in its 2019 Judgment the Court made clear that it saw “no reason to depart now
from the interpretation of ‘freedom of commerce’ that it adopted in the [Oil Platforms] case” 64.
Recognizing that, in order to establish a breach of obligation under Article X (1), there must be a
sufficiently close relationship between the impugned conduct and the acts of commerce, the Court
stated that “freedom of commerce cannot cover matters that have no connection, or too tenuous a
connection, with the commercial relations between the States Parties to the Treaty” 65. The Court has
also observed that it must be established that there is actual and ongoing commerce that was impeded
by the impugned activities; and that Article X, paragraph 1, “is in terms limited to the protection of
freedom of commerce ‘between the territories of the two High Contracting Parties’” 66. Such
commerce must be sufficiently direct 67. Lastly, the Court has stated that in order to demonstrate a
violation of Article X (1), a party must do more than plead a “generic” claim of breach and must
identify specific conduct that impeded commerce 68.


       40. Iran argues that the United States’ measures resulting in the freezing or seizure of the assets
belonging to Iranian financial institutions and State-owned entities have “rendered impossible”
commerce between the United States and Iran with respect to those entities 69. Iran specifically refers
to the attachment proceedings in relation to contractual debts owed by United States companies to
TIC, Bank Melli and the Iranian Ministry of Defence 70. For Iran’s claim to succeed, it must
demonstrate that a sufficiently direct nexus exists between the impugned United States measures and
freedom of commerce. In my view, however, many of the measures challenged by Iran —
particularly those legislative measures that merely authorize the attachment of the assets of Iranian
State-owned entities to enforce judgments rendered against Iran — do not directly affect trade or
commerce between the two States. Firstly, while the Court has made clear that Article X (1) does not
only cover purchase and sale, but also applies to “ancillary activities integrally related to
commerce” 71, the impugned measures are not analogous to the conduct in Oil Platforms. That case
concerned conduct amounting to interference with the antecedent activities to a commercial
transaction; specifically, the production of oil that would later be traded on the international market.
By contrast, the attachment of assets of Iranian companies does not target an element in the
commercial process. Such measures, in Iran’s own words, merely affect “the products of
commerce” 72.


       41. Secondly, to the extent that one or more of the impugned measures are capable of directly
affecting commerce, Iran has not demonstrated that there has been actual interference with
then-existing and ongoing commerce. Taken in isolation, Executive Order 13599 has the potential to

interfere with commerce by “blocking” all assets belonging to the Iranian Government and Iranian
financial institutions located in the United States. However, by 2012 when the Order was issued,
there were already a range of existing sanctions and other measures (not challenged by Iran in these
proceedings) that made commerce between Iran and the United States extremely difficult. For
example, Iran complains about the treatment of certain assets of Bank Melli. But those assets were
blocked in 2007 and were therefore unaffected by Executive Order 13599 73. Similarly, financial
transactions between Iran and the United States were severely restricted in 2008 by a regulation that
prohibited so-called “U-turn” transfers that had previously been used by United States banks 74. There
is therefore reason to believe that there was little, if any, commerce left between Iran and the
United States in 2012 that could have been impeded by the Executive Order 75. Iran refers generally
to the fact that United States census data demonstrates that a small amount of trade existed between
the United States and Iran in 2016, the year Iran initiated these proceedings 76. However, it provides
no specific evidence as to how this ongoing trade was affected by the Executive Order or other
measures at issue.


       42. Thirdly, some of the examples of “commerce” cited by Iran are not in fact commercial in
nature. In view of the Court’s finding that Bank Markazi is not a company for purposes of Articles III,
IV and V of the Treaty, it follows that the Bank’s investments in the United States do not qualify as
“commercial” for purposes of Article X, paragraph 1. Lastly, regarding the requirement for
commerce “between the territories of the two High Contracting Parties” to be sufficiently direct,
there is evidence on record that, from as early as 1995, there were no direct transactions between
United States and Iranian banks and that the investments made by Bank Markazi took place through
various intermediaries located outside the territories of the Parties, a fact not challenged by Iran 77. In
my view, Iran has not established that there was commerce between the Parties on their territories as
required by Article X, paragraph 1, let alone that it was impeded by Executive Order 13599.


       43. For the above reasons, Iran has, in my view, not demonstrated that the United States has
violated its obligations under Article X (1) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity.

                            IV. DEFENCES UNDER ARTICLE XX, PARAGRAPH 1

               Application of Article XX, paragraph 1 (c) and (d), of the 1955 Treaty

      44. Whilst I agree with the Court’s conclusion in paragraph 103 regarding the
non-applicability of Article XX, paragraph 1 (c) to the present case, I disagree with its conclusion in
paragraph 109 regarding Article XX, paragraph 1 (d).


       45. Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) exempts from the scope of the 1955 Treaty measures that are
“necessary to fulfill the obligations of a High Contracting Party for the maintenance or restoration of
international peace and security, or necessary to protect its essential security interests”. The Court
has previously interpreted the scope of both Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) and an identically worded

provision in the Military and Paramilitary Activities and Oil Platforms cases. In both cases, the Court
made clear that the exception is not self-judging, explaining that it is for the Court to determine
whether there existed essential security interests at the time of the challenged measures and whether
such conduct measures were “necessary” to protect such interests 78.


       46. The United States asserts that the “essential security interests” at issue here are its interests
in preventing terrorist attacks against the United States and its nationals, preventing terrorist
financing and the supply of arms to terrorist groups, and combating Iran’s development of a ballistic
missile programme. In Military and Paramilitary Activities, the Court stated that “the concept of
essential security interests certainly extends beyond the concept of an armed attack, and has been
subject to very broad interpretations in the past” 79. Even interpreted relatively narrowly, it is likely
that the interests alleged by the United States in this case, which relate to counterterrorism,
prevention of arms trafficking and arms production, safely fall within the category of “essential
security interests” to which the exception in Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) applies. Accordingly,
Executive Order 13599 is, in my view, a measure falling within Article XX, paragraph 1 (d) of the
Treaty and is therefore not subject to the terms of the said Treaty.


                                                       V. REMEDIES

      47. I disagree with the conclusions of the Court in paragraph 231 as well as its findings in
paragraph 236 (7) and (8) of the Judgment. In view of my opinion above that Iran has failed to
substantiate any of its claims or to establish that the United States has violated the provisions of the
1955 Treaty, I am of the view that the Respondent is under no obligation to compensate Iran.
