       1. As indicated by the title of the case, today’s Judgment is meant to resolve a “dispute over
the status and use of the waters of the Silala”, the international watercourse shared between the
Parties. The Court addresses five claims made by the Applicant and three counter-claims made by
the Respondent and, in the Judgment’s operative paragraph, it rejects one of the Applicant’s claims
and one of the Respondent’s counter-claims (Judgment, para. 163 (5) and (8)). I concur with both
these rejections.


       2. The remaining claims and counter-claims concern several other important aspects of the
Parties’ relations as riparian States. I am in full agreement with the Court’s reasoning in respect of
the rights and obligations of States sharing an international watercourse. And yet, despite its thorough
analysis, the Court neither upholds nor rejects any of the remaining claims and counter-claims.
Instead, regarding each of them, the Court examines the Parties’ pleadings and final submissions
with a view to ascertaining whether the Parties “have come to agree in substance” (Judgment,
para. 46). After affirming the Parties’ convergence of positions, the Court concludes that each of
these claims and counter-claims “no longer has any object”, which in turn entails that the Court “is
not called upon to give a decision thereon” (Judgment, para. 163). Rather than resolving the dispute
brought before it, the Court has thus shifted its attention to the question — at issue between the
Parties — as to whether that dispute persists.


       3. To my regret, I cannot join the Court in its diversion to this “meta-dispute”, nor in its method
of approaching this question, nor in the answer at which it arrives. In my view, the Court’s analysis
introduces new uncertainties into the concept of a dispute (II). The concept of the convergence of
positions finds no basis in the Court’s jurisprudence (III), and it does not fit the facts of these
proceedings well (IV). Finally, it seems to me that the Court’s reasoning underestimates the
contribution a declaratory judgment may make in this case (V).

       4. A central tenet of the Court’s jurisprudence is that the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction
rests on the existence of a dispute 1. As a matter of principle, the elements on which the Court’s
jurisdiction depends must be fulfilled at the time of the institution of proceedings 2. The existence of
a dispute is no different 3. This is illustrated in Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite and Frontier
Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger), in which the Court had to ascertain whether a disagreement between
the parties  if one had ever existed  had disappeared by the time that the Court was seised 4.
Unlike the present case, the question in those cases was not whether the parties’ positions on a legal
issue converged after the institution of proceedings, but rather whether they had converged
beforehand. They were then standard cases where the existence of a dispute was ascertained with
reference to the date of the institution of proceedings.


      5. By contrast, the Court has rarely dealt with a dispute’s disappearance in the course of the
proceedings, or with the consequences of such disappearance. On a few occasions the Court has
contemplated the possibility that a dispute might disappear in the course of the proceedings 5, but it
has never identified the grounds for such disappearance nor its legal consequences. Even in Nuclear
Tests the decisive feature precluding a judgment on the merits was not the disappearance of the
dispute as such, but rather the fact that the object of the claim had been achieved, as I explain below.


       6. This Judgment expands the concept of the disappearance of a dispute and, in doing so, it
separates the dispute requirement from all other jurisdictional elements. The fulfilment of all other
preliminary requirements at the time of the institution of proceedings is, in principle, a necessary but
also a sufficient condition for the establishment of the Court’s jurisdiction. For example, lapse of the
jurisdictional title after the institution of proceedings does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction over
pending cases 6. When it comes to the existence of a dispute, however, according to the Judgment,
fulfilment of the requirement at the time of the institution of proceedings is a necessary but not a

sufficient condition because the dispute must continue to exist at the time of adjudication (Judgment,
para. 147; see also para. 41).


       7. The Judgment does not explain why the existence of a dispute should differ from all other
jurisdictional requirements in this respect. Nor does the Judgment indicate the precise legal effects
of the disappearance of a dispute, in particular whether such disappearance deprives the Court of its
jurisdiction, perhaps even retroactively, or whether it renders the application inadmissible. While this
issue is without practical effect in the present case, the Court’s pronouncement may be put to the test
where the Court’s jurisdiction has been affirmed through a binding judgment (for example, on
preliminary objections), only to be later called into question owing to the dispute’s disappearance in
the meantime 7.


       8. There is no doubt that the Court’s function in contentious cases is “to decide . . . disputes” 8.
Appeal to this proposition, however, does not provide any helpful conclusions as to the Court’s role
in ascertaining the continued existence of a dispute. More importantly, to the extent that a dispute
persists, albeit in a reduced form, adjudication does not run counter to the Court’s function. Any risk
of judicial overreach is sufficiently addressed through the application of other principles, notably the
non ultra petita principle, according to which the Court is only entitled to decide on questions
submitted to it 9.


       9. In my view, the Court’s analysis adds an unnecessary level of complexity and uncertainty
to the jurisprudence on the concept of a dispute. There is also a certain inconsistency in the Court’s
appreciation of events taking place in the course of the proceedings, in so far as the existence of a
dispute is concerned. Whereas the Court has lately been reluctant to accept that a dispute may
crystallize through the exchanges between the parties in the course of the proceedings 10, it is prepared
to accept that such exchanges may serve to shrink or extinguish a dispute.


      10. The Court’s entire analysis today is based on the premise that it is possible for “specific
claims [to] have become without object as a consequence of a convergence of positions or agreement
between the Parties, or for some other reason” (Judgment, para. 42). The Court’s reasoning, in my
view, leads to the merger of two quite distinct issues: the first concerns the circumstances under
which a claim is deprived of its object, while the second concerns the legal effects of a convergence
of positions between the parties to a dispute. I will examine these two issues separately in turn.

      11. The Judgment points out that the Court may refrain from rendering a judgment where an
application has become without object (Judgment, para. 41). The jurisprudence cited by the Court,
however, does not illuminate the grounds on which an application might lose its object; in particular,


       7 Compare Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and

Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), p. 94, para. 123.

it provides no support for the proposition that the convergence of the parties’ positions, or the
shrinkage of a dispute, constitutes a ground that deprives an application of its object. Even less so
does this jurisprudence indicate that the convergence of the parties’ positions on a specific claim
deprives that claim of its object.


       12. The passages from Border and Transborder Armed Actions 11 and Arrest Warrant 12 cited
in the Judgment affirm that events subsequent to the filing of the application may render that
application without object. The events envisaged (explicitly or implicitly) in those cases did not
however concern a convergence of the parties’ positions with respect to the questions previously
dividing them. The Judgment also relies on Northern Cameroons, in which the Court declined to
adjudicate the application brought before it by Cameroon seeking a declaration that the
United Kingdom had failed to respect various terms of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory
of the Cameroons under British Administration 13. The Court took this course, however, not because
the applicant’s claim had become without object, but rather because any judgment that the Court
might pronounce would be without object on account of the intervening termination of the
Trusteeship Agreement 14. In any event, that case did not involve a situation where the positions
between the parties had converged.


       13. This brings me to the Nuclear Tests Judgments, to which both Parties 15 and the Court
(Judgment, paras. 41 and 43) turn in support of the proposition that the disappearance of a dispute
precludes adjudication by the Court. On my reading, those cases are quite distinct from the situation
here. In Nuclear Tests, the dispute brought before the Court by each applicant (Australia and
New Zealand) essentially consisted of a single claim: a request for a declaration on the unlawfulness
of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons by the respondent (France) 16. The Court’s reasoning
unfolded in three steps. First, the Court “ascertain[ed] the true object and purpose of the claim”; in
the Court’s view, the object of the claim was “to obtain a termination of those tests” by the
respondent 17. Second, the Court affirmed that the respondent had made a legally binding undertaking
outside the Court to terminate its nuclear testing18. Indeed, a considerable part of the Nuclear Tests
Judgments is devoted to an exposition of the indicators of a unilateral act’s legally binding character
and to an analysis of France’s statements against that background 19. It was only after that finding that
the Court, at a third stage, concluded that the dispute between the parties had disappeared “because

the object of the claim ha[d] been achieved by other means” 20. The Court thus essentially held that
any legally binding judgment that it might deliver in favour of the applicants would be redundant,
because the respondent had already undertaken a legally binding obligation erga omnes to the same
effect. In other words, the respondent’s legally binding undertaking was a substitute for the legally
binding judgment that the applicants sought to obtain 21. The same underlying idea emerges from
Fisheries Jurisdiction, where the Court indicated that a legally binding agreement outside of Court
might render a judgment by the Court without object 22.


       14. This case is quite different. First of all, it is common ground that the dispute concerns the
status and use of the waters of the Silala. Unlike Nuclear Tests, there is no suggestion by the Court,
or indeed by the Parties, that either Party pursues a different “true” object when advancing its claims
or counter-claims. Second, and more importantly, there is no indication in the Judgment that the
object of any claim or counter-claim has been achieved by other means, or specifically that an
intervening act had a similar effect to that of France’s unilateral undertakings in Nuclear Tests.
Consequently, the Court’s leap directly to the third step of the Nuclear Tests reasoning — namely to
a finding that a claim (or counter-claim) has become without object — is puzzling.


       15. It is true that the Judgment attaches great weight to the statements made by the Parties in
the course of the proceedings. The Court correctly observes that it presumes the “good faith” of the
parties in making statements before it (Judgment, para. 46). At various other places, the Court “takes
note” of the fact that a Party has accepted the soundness of the other Party’s argument (Judgment,
paras. 58 and 75), and it states that one Party “may rely” on the position adopted by the other Party
in the course of the proceedings (Judgment, para. 146). That a statement is made in good faith,
however, does not necessarily imply that the State making it intends to be legally bound by it 23.
Besides, the Court stops short of explaining the legal effect of a Party’s reliance in its counterpart’s
representations, or indeed of a subsequent shift in the Parties’ positions. In doing so, the Judgment
raises questions such as whether a Party would be precluded from reverting to the position that it has
now abandoned 24, and whether this bar would operate in the context of judicial proceedings only, or
whether it would extend to any bilateral negotiations between the Parties.


        16. If anything, the Nuclear Tests Judgments illustrate that the Court should exercise great
caution when ascertaining whether a claim has become without object by the time of the Court’s
judgment. Where the parties have committed to legally binding obligations (whether unilaterally or
in concert) outside the Court, it may be unnecessary for the Court to discharge its function through a
legally binding judgment, because the parties’ undertakings offer the requisite legal security; this is
effectively the situation in Nuclear Tests. In the absence of legally binding commitments, however,
it is difficult to see why the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction runs counter to the Court’s judicial
function. Quite to the contrary, the Court held “that there [was] no incompatibility with its judicial
function in making a pronouncement on the rights and duties of the Parties under existing
international law” in Fisheries Jurisdiction, even though the parties had concluded an interim

provisional and temporally limited character of the interim agreement, which did not provide a
waiver of claims by either party in respect of matters in dispute 26.


                    IV. Ascertaining the convergence of positions between the Parties

       17. While Nuclear Tests refer to the dispute having “disappeared”, the reason for such
“disappearance” was not the convergence of the parties’ positions on issues that divided them at the
time of the institution of proceedings. Rather, France’s undertaking to cease atmospheric nuclear
testing bypassed the need to rule on any potential divergence of those positions. In fact, in no case
has the convergence of the parties’ positions led to a conclusion that a dispute has disappeared, nor
have such far-reaching conclusions been drawn from a disappearance.


       18. The Court here adopts a rather impressionistic approach to ascertain whether the Parties
are in agreement or not 27. Invoking its power to interpret the submissions of the Parties, the Court
ventures to establish why, despite their ostensible disagreement, the Parties in substance have come
to agree on several questions previously dividing them. Yet it is one thing to interpret the Parties’
final submissions, but it is quite another to overlook them entirely, as if they were abandoned in the
course of the proceedings. The Court has cautioned that “[a]bandonment cannot be presumed or
inferred; it must be declared expressly” 28. Indeed, the oral proceedings revealed that there remains
some ambiguity about the extent of the agreement between the Parties on particular issues: the
concessions by each Party with respect to its counterpart’s submissions tended to be carefully
qualified. Despite the explanations given orally, none of the Parties’ submissions was formally
withdrawn or amended significantly.


        19. Given that the Court has a “duty . . . to reply to the questions as stated in the final
submissions of the parties” 29, in my view it should have done so here through a declaratory judgment,
as it has done on multiple occasions in the past 30. Declarations clarifying the legal situation between
the parties can assist in stabilizing the legal relations between them. Unlike the situation in Northern
Cameroons, such a judgment in the present case would have “practical consequence[s] in the sense
that it c[ould] affect existing legal rights or obligations of the parties, thus removing uncertainty from
their legal relations” 31.

        20. Even if it is established that the Parties’ positions have converged in the course of the
proceedings, in my view it was necessary and appropriate for the Court to issue a declaratory
judgment recording the Parties’ agreement, as the Permanent Court did in similar situations. It is
relatively rare, of course, that the parties should come to an agreement in the course of the
proceedings but not seek to discontinue the case under Article 88 of the Rules of Court 32. Within this
atypical set of cases, however, judgments recording the parties’ agreement seem not only
unexceptional but also the most reasonable course of action. A case in point is Société Commerciale
de Belgique, in which the Permanent Court noted, in the operative clause of its Judgment, the
agreement that had been reached in the course of the proceedings 33. The Court’s predecessor has
affirmed that such judgments were in line with the spirit of its Statute 34. This suggests that it was not
only within the Court’s power but also its duty to issue such judgments, to the extent that they
facilitated the direct and friendly settlement of disputes between the parties35.


       21. The same principles apply to this Court 36. Of course, if the parties arrive at an agreement
prior to the Court’s seisin, then there exists no dispute at the time of the institution of proceedings
(see paragraph 4 above). In such a case, it is reasonable for the Court to refrain from recording in a
judgment the parties’ antecedent agreement, as is illustrated in Frontier Dispute
(Burkina Faso/Niger) (see Judgment, para. 46). Nonetheless, as the Court observed in that case, a
situation in which the parties seek a judgment recording an agreement that had been reached prior to
the Court’s seisin is readily distinguishable from a situation where the parties come to an agreement
during the proceedings 37. In the Court’s terms, it is at the very least “understandable” for the Court
to note, “in the operative part of its Judgment, [an] agreement arrived at between the Parties during
the proceedings, an agreement whose existence [is] bound to influence the settlement on the merits
of the dispute originally brought before the Court” 38.


       22. A judgment recording the points of agreement is in the interest of legal certainty between
the parties because it ensures that the parties commit to their positions. By contrast, if a judgment
identifies the parties’ positions as they stand at present but refrains from drawing consequences
therefrom with respect to the parties’ respective rights and obligations, there remains a risk that the
parties might change their positions in the future. This risk was anticipated in Nuclear Tests, where
the Court observed that “if the basis of this Judgment were to be affected”, the applicants could

request “an examination of the situation” underlying the case39. Leaving aside the question of
whether the Pact of Bogotá or any other jurisdictional title between the Parties will remain in force
in the future, the prospect of new proceedings for the resolution of questions that have already been
put forward to the Court is in tension with the sound administration of justice.


       23. States commonly assert rights for themselves or obligations for other States, which are
equally commonly contested by those other States. In most cases both parties’ positions in such
situations are based on a reasonable appreciation of the law in good faith, even if both positions
cannot be legally correct simultaneously. Where applicable jurisdictional requirements are fulfilled,
a State finding itself in such a situation is able to seek judicial recourse before the Court and to have
its dispute resolved by means of a legally binding judgment. In particular, a State claiming that it
enjoys a right, or that its adversary bears an obligation, has an interest in having the claimed right or
obligation definitively affirmed or rejected in a legally binding judgment by the Court possessing
jurisdiction. Despite its careful elaboration of the customary law of international watercourses, the
Court has not responded to this interest in the present case. In my view, the Court should have moored
its sound analysis at its natural berth, the operative paragraph of the Judgment.
