       1. I regret that I am unable to agree with the decision of the majority of the Court that the
United States of America has violated its obligation under Article III, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty
of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights (hereinafter the “Treaty of Amity” or “Treaty”).
I feel compelled to explain my position on what I see as the proper interpretation of Article III,
paragraph 1, of the Treaty and why the Applicant’s submission in this regard must be rejected.

      I am also unable to agree with the Court’s finding that the United States has violated its
obligation under Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty.



                     A. Interpretation of Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty

       2. Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty reads as follows:

              “Companies constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either High
       Contracting Party shall have their juridical status recognized within the territories of the
       other High Contracting Party. It is understood, however, that recognition of juridical
       status does not of itself confer rights upon companies to engage in the activities for
       which they are organized. As used in the present Treaty, ‘companies’ means
       corporations, partnerships, companies and other associations, whether or not with
       limited liability and whether or not for pecuniary profit.”


       3. Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty must be interpreted according to the customary rules
of treaty interpretation which, as the Court has repeatedly stated, are reflected in Articles 31 to 33 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1.


      4. Before interpreting Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty, it may be useful, as a preliminary
matter, to make two observations. First, Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty must be placed in its
proper historical context and economic background. When the Treaty was concluded, legal persons




       1 See e.g. Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, pp. 21-22, para. 41;

the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 116,
para. 33.

                                                             -2-

were often not recognized as having juridical status outside of their State of incorporation, absent a
treaty to this effect. Some States recognized each other’s legal persons on the basis of reciprocity,
while others only recognized legal persons that had been granted a special authorization 2. Following
the 1923 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Consular Relations concluded with Germany 3, several
Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (hereinafter “FCN”) treaties concluded by the United States
with other States included provisions guaranteeing the reciprocal recognition of the juridical status
of companies 4. Indeed, more than two dozen of these FCN treaties contain the exact or a substantially
similar provision to Article III, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty of Amity. A similar trend can be
observed in bilateral and multilateral treaties concluded at the time. The Hague Conference on Private
International Law drew up, in 1956, a Convention concerning the Recognition of the Legal
Personality of Foreign Companies, Associations and Foundations 5. It is worth recalling that, under
customary international law, States have no obligation, as such, to recognize the existence or capacity
of legal persons constituted under the laws and regulations of other States 6. A recognition of juridical
status is therefore necessary for legal persons to operate abroad, e.g. to conclude contracts, to collect
debts, or to have standing before courts 7. The 1955 Treaty of Amity, and its Article III, paragraph 1,
in particular, must be appreciated against this background.


       5. Second, it may be worthwhile to draw attention to the structure of Article III, paragraph 1,
of the Treaty.

       As can be seen, Article III, paragraph 1, contains four elements: the provision (a) defines the
term “companies” for the purpose of the Treaty; (b) sets out what is required for a company to
establish that it has the nationality of one of the Parties (i.e. it must be “constituted under the
applicable laws and regulations of either High Contracting Party”); (c) requires both Parties to
“recognize” the “juridical status” of such companies; and (d) provides that the “recognition of
juridical status” does not of itself confer rights upon companies to engage in the activities for which
they are organized.

       While these four elements are laid down together in Article III, paragraph 1, practice shows
that that need not necessarily be the case; they stand as independent clauses in some FCN treaties.


          6. With this said, I turn to the interpretation of Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty.

        7. I begin with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Treaty. The crux of the
matter is to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “shall have their juridical status recognized”. In this
regard, it is true that the phrase “juridical status” is not in itself very clear, the term “status” having
several meanings in international law. The term “recognition”, however, is unmistakeably a term of
art. While that term has several meanings 8, in the context of private international law (or conflict of
laws) “recognition” has a narrow, technical meaning, whereby the recognizing State agrees to extend
to its own system certain legal effects attributed to a fact or situation in the legal system of another
State 9. This could be, for instance, the “recognition” of a foreign award 10.

       In particular, when used to refer to legal persons constituted under the applicable laws and
regulations of another State, the concept refers to the recognition, by the recognizing State, of the
legal personality and legal capacity of such legal persons.


      8. This meaning of the term “recognition” has a long legal pedigree, as reflected in bilateral
and multilateral treaties and in the work of international bodies and learned societies, such as the
Committee of Experts for the Progressive Codification of International Law of the League of Nations,
which studied the topic “Recognition of the Legal Personality of Foreign Commercial Corporations”
in 1927. A report of the Sub-Committee of Experts asserts that recognition

       “implies that the corporation [incorporated in one State] . . . must be regarded [by the
       recognizing State] as possessing a general capacity, in virtue of which it is entitled to
       defend its rights . . . Supposing that the company should find itself compelled to defend
       its rights of this character before a foreign court, it would be unable to institute any legal
       proceedings if it were regarded by the lex fori as non-existent.” 11


       9. This meaning of the term is also reflected in the resolutions and works of the Institut de
droit international 12. For instance, a preliminary report prepared by Rapporteur George van Hecke in
1963 on the topic of “Companies in Private International Law” explains that

       “[p]revious Institute resolutions, the convention drawn up by the Hague Conference [in
       1956] and bilateral treaties generally deal with the ‘recognition’ of the personality of
       foreign companies. This need to ensure, by a separate rule, the ‘recognition’ of foreign
       companies as subjects of law (including, in particular, the capacity to conclude
       contracts and to sue and be sued) can be explained by the difficulties caused in the
       nineteenth century by certain theories . . . which denied the existence of juridical

       persons other than those created by an act of the local authority. It seems that these
       difficulties can now be considered as belonging to the history of law” (my translation) 13.


      10. These materials indicate that the term “recognition” used in Article III, paragraph 1, of the
Treaty, had a specific meaning as a concept in treaty practice when the Parties used it 14.


       11. As noted by the Court, the object and purpose of the Treaty of Amity, which is stated in
its preamble, is to “encourag[e] mutually beneficial trade and investments and closer economic
intercourse generally” (Judgment, para. 214). This object and purpose throws light upon the
appropriate interpretation of Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty. The recognition of juridical status
set out in Article III, paragraph 1, obviously espouses the goal of “encouraging mutually beneficial
trade and investments” between the Parties, for a company of one Party with no recognized existence
or no legal capacity would not be able to operate within the territories of the other Party.


       12. The context is also relevant. Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty is linked with Article III,
paragraph 2, which grants nationals and companies freedom of access to the courts of justice and
administrative agencies within the territories of the other Party, both in defence and pursuit of their
rights. This link, in my opinion, shows that the recognition of juridical status in Article III,
paragraph 1, was granted primarily so that the companies of either Party may have free access to
courts in the territories of the other.


       13. What has been said so far, in my view, is sufficient to arrive at the proper interpretation of
Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty. Recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, however,
puts to rest any doubt on the matter. I refer, in particular, to the preparatory work of the Treaty of
Amity.


       14. A telegram dated 9 November 1954 from the United States Department of State to the
Embassy in Tehran provides additional insight into the meaning of “juridical status”. The telegram
was sent during the negotiations between the Parties, as Iran expressed concerns about the scope of
the term “companies” in Article III, paragraph 1. The telegram provided the following explanation:




        13 Annuaire de l’Institut de droit international, Vol. 51 (I), Session de Varsovie, 1965, pp. 252-253 (emphasis

added). The original French text reads as follows:
               “Les Résolutions antérieures de l’Institut, la convention élaborée par la Conférence de La Haye
       [en 1956] et les traités bilatéraux traitent généralement de la ‘reconnaissance’ de la personnalité des sociétés
       étrangères. Cette nécessité d’assurer, par une règle séparée, la ‘reconnaissance’ des sociétés étrangères
       comme sujet de droit (comportant notamment la capacité de conclure des contrats et d’ester en justice)
       s’explique par les difficultés causées, au XIXe siècle, par certaines théories . . . qui niaient l’existence des
       personnes morales créées autrement que par un acte de l’autorité locale. Il semble qu’on puisse, à l’heure
       actuelle, considérer ces difficultés comme appartenant à l’histoire du droit.”

              “Paragraph [one] confers no rights [on] corporations [to] engage in business.
       It merely provides their recognition as corporate entities principally in order [that] they
       may prosecute or defend their rights in court as corporate entities. In this sense
       paragraph one [is] related [to] paragraph two [on access to courts]. Under [the] treaty,
       no U.S. corporation may engage in business in Iran except as permitted by Iran.
       Corporate status should be recognized [to] assure [the] right [of] foreign corporate
       entities — those that sell goods or furnish other services to Iran as well as those
       permitted [to] operate in Iran — [to] free access [to] courts [to] collect debts, protect
       patent rights, enforce contracts, etc. If this explanation fails [to] remove difficulty,
       request more detailed statement [of the] problem.”15

A subsequent telegram from the United States Embassy confirmed that Iranian officials had
understood the United States’ explanation of this provision 16. In my view, these telegrams reveal the
shared understanding of the Parties regarding the interpretation of the Treaty.


       15. In light of the foregoing, I conclude that Article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty provides for
the obligation of the Parties to recognize the “juridical status” of companies constituted under the
applicable laws and regulations of either Party, understood as recognizing their legal personality and
legal capacity.


                                                B. Iran’s submission

       16. In its final submissions, Iran asks the Court to adjudge and declare that,

       “by its acts, in particular its failure to recognise the separate juridical status (including
       the separate legal personality) of all Iranian companies including Bank Markazi, the
       United States has breached its obligations to Iran . . . under Article III (1) of the Treaty
       of Amity” (emphasis added).

As noted in the Judgment (para. 135), the Parties differ on how to interpret Article III, paragraph 1,
of the Treaty, and the question whether the United States has breached its obligation under that
provision. The Judgment, however, fails to truly capture the heart of their disagreement.


       17. For the United States, to recognize a company’s juridical status is to recognize the
company’s existence as a legal entity and its legal capacity17. In its view, Article III, paragraph 1,
was “only intended to ensure that legal persons could, on the basis of being incorporated in one of
the Parties, have ‘legal being’ in the territory of the other Party” 18. It maintains that the very fact that
Iranian companies have appeared and participated in domestic judicial proceedings demonstrates that
their juridical status has been recognized (Judgment, para. 130).
