                       1. I voted in favour of all the points contained in operative para-
                    graph 115 of the Judgment. I also concur with the essence of the Court’s
                    reasoning. In the following declaration, I shall first make a few observa-
                    tions regarding the change in Myanmar’s representation during these pro-
                    ceedings. I shall then elaborate on the Court’s reasoning with respect to
                    The Gambia’s standing. This will be done in the spirit of contributing to
                    the transparency of judicial reasoning regarding a legal issue which lies at
                    the intersection of procedure and substance and which is of considerable
                    importance 1.

                       5. In my opinion, under such circumstances, for the Court to proceed
                    in the way that it did is less than satisfactory. On a more general level, I
                    have been left wondering whether it might be appropriate for the Court
                    to reflect on how it deals with factual and legal difficulties in identifying
                    the government of a given State for the purposes of representation in
                    proceedings before the Court, with a view to exploring possible improve-
                    ments in this regard in the future.

                                           III. The Gambia’s Standing

                      6. In paragraphs 106 to 113 of the Judgment, the Court applies the
                    concept of obligation erga omnes partes to the relevant obligations of the
                    Genocide Convention in order to explain The Gambia’s standing in the
                    case. Here too, I agree with the essence of the Court’s reasoning. How-
                    ever, in view of the considerable significance of this aspect of the Judg-
                    ment, I wish to elaborate on it a little further.

                                            1. A Point of Terminology
                       7. I shall begin with a point of terminology. In the present case,
                    The Gambia alleges the violation of an obligation erga omnes partes, but
                    it does not claim to have been specially affected by that violation. While
                    Myanmar refers to The Gambia as a non-­injured State (CR 2022/1, p. 28,
                    paras. 7-8 (Talmon)), The Gambia describes itself as an injured (though
                    not specially injured) State (Written Observations of The Gambia on the
                    Preliminary Objections Raised by Myanmar (hereinafter “Written Obser-
                    vations of The Gambia”), paras. 3.9 and 3.52). In order to better under-
                    stand the Parties’ divergent uses of the term “injured State”, it is helpful
                    to refer to the International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility
                    of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter the “ILC Articles
                    on State Responsibility”). Articles 42 and 48 of the ILC Articles on State
                    Responsibility distinguish between an “injured State”, on the one hand,
                    and a “State other than an injured State” which is entitled to invoke the
                    responsibility of another State resulting from that State’s violation of an
                    obligation erga omnes (partes), on the other.
                       8. Myanmar’s qualification of The Gambia as a “non-­injured” State is
                    in line with the ILC’s use of that term: pursuant to the ILC Articles on
                    State Responsibility, The Gambia is a non-­injured State because the obli-
                    gations whose breach it invokes do not fall under any of the cases listed
                    in Article 42 of those Articles, and, in particular, because The Gambia is
                    not specially affected within the meaning of Article 42 (b) (i).
                       9. For The Gambia, however, the violation of an obligation erga omnes
                    partes “necessarily injures omnes partes” (Written Observations of





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 132                                                                              3/09/23 09:53

                             of an essential norm for the international community, on account of
                             their intimate participation in that community” 8.

                     2. A Few Reflections on the Concept of Obligation Erga Omnes (Partes)
                                    and Its Application in the Present Case
                       12. I shall now turn from terminology to the substance of the matter.
                    One argument put forward by Myanmar in order to deny The Gambia’s
                    standing consists in attempting to make a distinction between the “com-
                    mon” interest in the accomplishment of the high purposes of the Geno-
                    cide Convention, on the one hand, and the “individual legal interest” of
                    every State party in compliance with the relevant obligations under the
                    Convention, on the other (CR 2022/1, pp. 28‑29, paras. 8‑13 (Talmon)).
                    The Court responds to this argument in paragraph 108 of the Judgment
                    and, in doing so, relies on its ruling in the case concerning Questions relat-
                    ing to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal)
                    (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68).
                       13. Indeed, Myanmar is unsuccessful in its attempts to distinguish
                    between the present case and the one between Belgium and Senegal for
                    the purposes of the present proceedings. While it is true, as argued by
                    Myanmar, that the content of the obligation at issue in the Belgium v.
                    Senegal case is different to that of the obligation in question in the present
                    case (CR 2022/1, p. 36, para. 49 (Talmon)), this has no bearing: in their
                    crucial respect — the structure of the legal relationship that they estab-
                    lish — the obligations in question do not differ in any meaningful way.
                    Both have been established in the pursuit of a common (or collective)
                    interest and may thus be called collective obligations. And, contrary to
                    Myanmar’s assertions (Preliminary Objections of the Republic of the
                    Union of Myanmar (hereinafter “Preliminary Objections of Myanmar”),
                    para. 242), the Court’s Judgment in Belgium v. Senegal cannot be set

                    544 	 application of the genocide convention (decl. kress)

                    aside because Belgium also claimed to have a special interest, as the Court
                    recalls in paragraph 108 of the present Judgment. Indeed, the Court
                    explicitly stated in its Judgment in the Belgium v. Senegal case that the
                    question whether Belgium had such a special interest was immaterial to
                    its determination (Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or
                    Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II),
                    p. 450, para. 70).
                       14. In addition, to distinguish between “common interest” and “indi-
                    vidual interest” in the way the Court was asked to do by Myanmar would
                    be to fail to take due account of the fact that the international community
                    is not fully institutionalized and that, as a result, individual States have
                    an important function in allowing the “common interest” to be provided
                    with judicial protection 9. As Brigitte Stern has astutely observed:

                            “Indeed, if the existence of collective interests is recognized in the
                         absence of the personification of the international community, it can
                         be considered that each of its constituent parts — i.e. each of the
                         States making up the community — is a custodian of these collective
                         interests and is responsible for ensuring that they are respected by all
                         other States. After all, we speak of erga omnes obligations and not
                         erga totum obligations!” 10
                       15. States may of course decide not to vest the attainment or preserva-
                    tion of a common interest with judicial protection when drafting a con-
                    vention to one of those ends. But such a decision cannot be presumed.
                    Once it has been determined that an obligation has been established in
                    pursuit of a common interest, such as that laid down by the Genocide
                    Convention, there is thus no need to demonstrate, on the basis of addi-
                    tional considerations, the existence of a separate “individual legal inter-
                    est” in order to justify standing before the Court. On the contrary, the
                    standing of each contracting State to invoke before the Court a common
                    interest such as that established by the Genocide Convention must be
                    presumed, unless the provisions of the relevant convention indicate other-
                    wise. The approach to the question of standing that the Court chose to
                    adopt in its 1966 Judgment in the South West Africa cases is understood
                    by one learned observer to amount to a “presumption against the exis-
                    tence of treaty-based enforcement rights irrespective of individual
                    injury” 11. If such an overly broad presumption is indeed the judicial mes-
                    sage of the Court’s 1966 Judgment in the South West Africa cases, the


                       9 Reference may be made here to G. Scelle’s early idea of a dédoublement fonctionnel

                        17. In order to establish The Gambia’s standing in the present case,
                     the Court was also not required to elaborate in more detail on what it
                     takes for an obligation, enshrined in a convention, to “transcend the
                     sphere of the bilateral relations of the States parties” 12 so as to acquire
                    an erga omnes partes character. More specifically, it was not necessary
                    for the Court to look more closely at the concept of “common interest”
                    (or collective interest) as a prerequisite for the presumption mentioned
                    in paragraph 15 above that an obligation possesses an erga omnes partes
                    character 13. For this specific purpose, the common interest must extend
                     beyond the shared interest that all States parties have in the preserva-
                     tion of the legal régime established by a multilateral treaty, because
                     such an interest also exists in instances of what Judge Simma, writing in
                     his scholarly capacity, has called a “multilateral treaty bilateral in
                     application” 14. The Court referred to a common interest of this kind in
                     the case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teh-
                     ran (United States of America v. Iran) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980,
                     pp. 42‑43, para. 92), for example 15. The Court has previously made it

                    546 	 application of the genocide convention (decl. kress)

                    abundantly clear that the Genocide Convention serves a much more
                    pronounced common interest in that it recognizes and protects a funda-
                    mentally important common value 16. In particular, the Court has
                    already affirmed that the Genocide Convention “was manifestly adopted
                    for a purely humanitarian and civilizing purpose” and that “its object
                    on the one hand is to safeguard the very existence of certain human
                    groups and on the other to confirm and endorse the most elementary
                    principles of morality” (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention
                    and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.
                    Reports 1951, p. 23). Moreover, the Court has already determined that
                    the outlawing of genocide has given rise to obligations not only erga
                    omnes partes but towards the international community as a whole, i.e.
                    obligations erga omnes (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company,
                    Limited (New Application: 1962) (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase,
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, paras. 33‑34). In this connection,
                    it may be added that the interest of the international community as a
                    whole is of such weight that the prohibition of genocide constitutes a
                    peremptory norm of general international law (Armed Activities on the
                    Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic
                    of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,
                    I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 32, para. 64). Beyond this, the commission of
                    genocide directly engages the criminal responsibility of the individual
                    concerned under customary international law 17. Hence, the outlawing
                    of genocide, in addition to establishing obligations incumbent on States
                    towards the international community as a whole, has created obliga-
                    tions for individuals, compliance with which is sanctioned by virtue of a
                    jus puniendi that serves, once again, an interest of the international com-
                    munity as a whole. Against this background, the Court was not required,
                    in the present case, to consider the outer limits of the concept of “com-
                    mon interest” for the purpose of recognizing obligations erga omnes
                    (partes).
                       18. The fact that the Genocide Convention itself opens up a number of
                    different avenues through which to act in the pursuit of the common
                    interest, and that international law, more broadly, envisages even more

                    way to act in the relevant common interest, a State’s entitlement to seek
                    judicial protection before the Court significantly complements the other
                    avenues through which it may uphold that interest.

                       19. Another argument put forward by Myanmar to deny The Gam-
                    bia’s standing consists in contending that the right to invoke the responsi-
                    bility of another State must not be confused with the “fundamentally
                    different” right to enforce such a responsibility “by bringing a case before
                    the Court” (Preliminary Objections of Myanmar, para. 218). In response
                    to this argument, the Court observes, in paragraph 108 of the Judgment,

                    to the Court’s earlier jurisprudence, the distinction between the jurisdic-
                    tional requirement of State consent to jurisdiction and the admissibility
                    requirement of standing also applies in the case of an obligation erga
                    omnes (partes) (see, for example, Armed Activities on the Territory of the
                    Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.
                    Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006,
                    p. 32, para. 64). This distinction works both ways : just as the existence of

                    the possibility to enter a reservation to a compromissory clause contained
                    in a convention preclude the characterization of obligations contained in
                    the same convention as applying erga omnes partes 19.
                       21. In the latter case, the option to enter a reservation simply means
                    that every State party to the convention concerned is in a position to pre-
                    vent, by way of a reservation, its responsibility for the violation of an
                    obligation erga omnes partes being invoked through the institution of
                    proceedings before the Court, without this in any way contradicting the
                    erga omnes partes nature of the obligation in question (Questions relating
                    to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Judg-

                       22. In recognizing The Gambia’s standing, the Judgment does nothing
                    to depart from this jurisprudence. Therefore, Myanmar’s reference to the
                    Court’s previous observation that “the erga omnes character of a norm
                    and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things” (East
                    Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102,
                    para. 29, quoted in Preliminary Objections of Myanmar, para. 219), while
                    being correct in and of itself, is immaterial to the question of The Gam-

                                              in Barcelona Traction
                       23. In paragraph 109 of the Judgment, the Court rightly states that
                    “[f]or the purpose of institut[ing]. . . proceedings before the Court, a State
                    does not need to demonstrate that any victims of an alleged breach of
                    obligations erga omnes partes under the Genocide Convention are its
                    nationals”.
                       24. In support of its argument to the contrary, Myanmar refers to the
                    Court’s previous observation that, “on the universal level, the instru-
                    ments which embody human rights do not confer on States the capacity
                    to protect the victims of infringements of such rights irrespective of their
                    nationality” (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited
                    (New Application: 1962) (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase, Judgment,
                    I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 47, para. 91).
                       25. I do not consider this observation in Barcelona Traction to have
                    been worded in a felicitous manner: because of its broad formulation, it
                    could be construed as suggesting that the human rights obligations

                    enshrined in universal instruments do not possess an erga omnes partes
                    character. If interpreted in such a manner, it would, however, be difficult
                    to reconcile this passage in the Barcelona Traction Judgment with the
                    Court’s earlier pronouncement in the same Judgment that “the principles
                    and rules concerning the basic rights of the human person” are obligations
                    erga omnes (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (New
                    Application: 1962) (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J.
                    Reports 1970, p. 32, paras. 33‑34) 20. Moreover, if interpreted in such a
                    manner, the observation in paragraph 91 of the Barcelona Traction Judg-
                    ment would be contrary to the position adopted by the Human Rights
                    Committee of the United Nations in General Comment No. 31, which is
                    worded in the following terms:
                             “While article 2 is couched in terms of the obligations of State
                         Parties towards individuals as the right-­holders under the Covenant,
                         every State Party has a legal interest in the performance by every other
                         State Party of its obligations. This follows from the fact that the ‘rules
                         concerning the basic rights of the human person’ are erga omnes obli-
                         gations and that, as indicated in the fourth preambular paragraph of
                         the Covenant, there is a United Nations Charter obligation to pro-
                         mote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fun-
                         damental freedoms. Furthermore, the contractual dimension of the
                         treaty involves any State Party to a treaty being obligated to every
                         other State Party to comply with its undertakings under the treaty.
                         In this connection, the Committee reminds States Parties of the
                         ­desirability of making the declaration contemplated in article 41. It
                          further reminds those States Parties already having made the decla-
                          ration of the potential value of availing themselves of the procedure
                          under that article. However, the mere fact that a formal interstate
                          mechanism for complaints to the Human Rights Committee exists in
                          respect of States Parties that have made the declaration under arti-
                          cle 41 does not mean that this procedure is the only method by which
                          States Parties can assert their interest in the performance of other
                          States Parties. On the contrary, the article 41 procedure should be
                          seen as supplementary to, not diminishing of, States Parties’ interest
                          in each others’ discharge of their obligations. Accordingly, the Com-
                          mittee commends to States Parties the view that violations of Cove-
                          nant rights by any State Party deserve their attention. To draw
                          attention to possible breaches of Covenant obligations by other States
                          Parties and to call on them to comply with their Covenant obligations
                          should, far from being regarded as an unfriendly act, be considered
                          as a reflection of legitimate community interest.” 21

                    Paragraph 91 of the Barcelona Traction Judgment should therefore not be
                    interpreted so as to deny the possibility that human rights obligations
                    enshrined in universal instruments possess an erga omnes partes charac-
                    ter. Instead, it should be understood as an imperfectly worded reference
                    to the limitations that exist under certain universal human rights instru-
                    ments with a view to the possibility of instituting judicial proceedings for
                    an alleged violation 22. When viewed in this way, it becomes clear that
                    Myanmar’s reference to paragraph 91 of the Barcelona Traction Judg-
                    ment fails to appreciate that the Genocide Convention is different from
                    two of the main universal instruments to which the Court alludes —
                    namely, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
                    Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights — in
                    at least one important respect. Article IX of the Genocide Convention
                    provides for a compromissory clause. For this reason, the Genocide Con-
                    vention is, for the purposes identified by Myanmar, much more compa-
                    rable, as regards the inapplicability of the nationality of claims rule, with
                    the regional human rights instrument explicitly mentioned by the Court
                    in the Barcelona Traction case :


                            “It is therefore still on the regional level that a solution to this
                         problem has had to be sought ; thus, within the Council of Europe,
                         of which Spain is not a member, the problem of admissibility encoun-
                         tered by the claim in the present case has been resolved by the Euro-
                         pean Convention on Human Rights, which entitles each State which
                         is a party to the Convention to lodge a complaint against any other
                         contracting State for violation of the Convention, irrespective of the
                         nationality of the victim.” (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Com-

                    It should be noted in passing that, with respect to the human rights obli-
                    gations enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights,

                    551 	 application of the genocide convention (decl. kress)

                         6. A Few Reflections on Paragraph 113 of the Judgment (Myanmar’s
                              Argument Based on Bangladesh’s Reservation to Article IX
                                            of the Genocide Convention)
                       26. With respect to Myanmar’s argument based on Bangladesh’s reser-
                    vation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, the Court observes in
                    paragraph 113 of the Judgment that Bangladesh has faced a large influx
                    of refugees. The Court goes on to say the following: “However, this fact
                    does not affect the right of all other Contracting Parties to assert the com-
                    mon interest in compliance with the obligations erga omnes partes under
                    the Convention and therefore does not preclude The Gambia’s standing
                    in the present case.” This sentence is as correct as it is condensed.
                       27. There are three possible explanations for this sentence. The first is
                    that Bangladesh, despite having faced a large influx of refugees, does not
                    have a special legal interest entitling it to invoke Myanmar’s responsibil-
                    ity for alleged violations of the Genocide Convention and that any ques-
                    tion of Bangladesh’s standing taking priority over the standing of
                    The Gambia thus does not arise. The second possible explanation is that
                    Bangladesh does have a special legal interest but that The Gambia’s
                    standing is not dependent on that of Bangladesh. The third possible
                    explanation is a cumulation of the previous two, i.e. that Bangladesh does
                    not have a special legal interest but, even if it did, The Gambia’s standing
                    would not be dependent on that of Bangladesh. The Judgment is silent in
                    respect of these three possible explanations. However, since I deem the
                    legal questions concerned to be important, I wish to offer my views on
                    them.
                       28. When addressing the question as to whether Bangladesh has a spe-
                    cial legal interest entitling it to invoke Myanmar’s responsibility for
                    alleged violations of the Genocide Convention, it is useful to consider the
                    concept of “specially affected State”, even though the Court does not
                    make use of it in the present Judgment. Judge Simma, once stated in
                    respect of Article 60, paragraph 2 (a), of the Vienna Convention on the
