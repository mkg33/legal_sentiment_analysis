      1. In this opinion I explain my disagreement with paragraph 236 (1) of the Judgment, in which
the Court upholds the

      “objection to jurisdiction raised by the United States of America relating to the claims
      of the Islamic Republic of Iran under Articles III, IV and V of the 1955 Treaty of Amity,
      Economic Relations, and Consular Rights, to the extent that they relate to treatment
      accorded to Bank Markazi and, accordingly, finds that it has no jurisdiction to consider
      those claims”.

I also offer observations on other aspects of the Judgment.

       2. By virtue of paragraph 236 (1) of the Judgment, the Court finds that Bank Markazi, Iran’s
Central Bank, is not a company within the meaning of Article III (1), and therefore, is not entitled to
the protection afforded to companies by Article III, IV, and V of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic
Relations, and Consular Rights (“Treaty”). This finding is based on reasoning that is flatly
contradicted by the Court’s 2019 preliminary objections Judgment (“2019 Judgment”) in this case.

       3. In its third objection to jurisdiction, submitted at the preliminary objections phase of this
case, the United States requested the Court to dismiss “as outside the Court’s jurisdiction all claims
of purported violations of Article III, IV, and V of the Treaty of Amity that are predicated on
treatment accorded to the Government of Iran or Bank Markazi”.


      4. The opinion will examine, first, the dicta in the 2019 Judgment relating to characterization
of an entity as a company under the Treaty, and then, the Court’s reasoning in this Judgment. It is
important to carry out this exercise because the approach taken by this Judgment conflicts with the
2019 Judgment, notwithstanding assertions to the contrary.

       6. In paragraph 89, which reflects the first phase of the reasoning, the Court indicates that it
will “determine[] whether, by the nature of its activities, Bank Markazi may be characterized as a
‘company’ according to the definition given by Article III, paragraph 1, read in its context and in
light of the object and purpose of the Treaty of Amity”. In this paragraph, the Court’s objective is to
determine whether the characterization of Bank Markazi as a company may be made on the basis of
the nature of its activities. Notably, in its proposed analysis, apart from the nature of the activities of
Bank Markazi, the Court makes no reference to any other factor, such as the Bank’s function or
purpose, as playing a role in determining its characterization as a company.

       7. In paragraph 90, which sets out the second phase of the Court’s reasoning, the Court rejects
Iran’s argument that the nature of the activities carried out by an entity is irrelevant for the purpose
of characterizing it as a company, thereby reaffirming the significance of the nature of the activities
in the characterization of an entity as a company.

       8. In paragraph 91, which sets out the third phase of the reasoning, the Court proceeds to
interpret the definition of a company in Article III (1) in its relevant context and in light of the object
and purpose of the Treaty; such an interpretation, in the view of the Court, “points clearly to the
conclusion that the Treaty is aimed at guaranteeing rights and affording protections to natural and
legal persons engaging in activities of a commercial nature, even if this latter term is to be understood
in a broad sense”. What is noteworthy here is the Court’s finding that the latter term, “activities of a
commercial nature”, is not to be interpreted narrowly, but broadly.

       9. In the final section of paragraph 91, which sets out the fourth phase of the Court’s reasoning,
the Court concludes “that an entity carrying out exclusively sovereign activities, linked to the
sovereign functions of the State, cannot be characterized as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the
Treaty and, consequently, may not claim the benefit of the rights and protections provided for in
Articles III, IV and V”. Here, the Court arrives at a fairly obvious conclusion: if the entity is carrying
out exclusively sovereign activities, linked to the sovereign functions of the State, then it is not
engaging in activities of a commercial nature; it is in fact engaging in activities which attract
sovereign immunity.

      10. In light of the Court’s determination in the 2019 Judgment that issues of sovereign
immunity are not within its jurisdiction, the Judgment, in some parts, appears to flirt with that
question without engaging with it; the first section of paragraph 91 of the 2019 Judgment is an
example of this flirtation; another example is paragraph 65 of that Judgment.

      11. In paragraph 92, which sets out the fifth phase of the reasoning, the Court states that
notwithstanding the previous conclusion, as a matter of principle, nothing prevents an entity from
engaging in activities of a commercial nature as well as sovereign activities.

      12. In the second sentence of paragraph 92, which sets out the sixth and final phase of the
Court’s reasoning, the Court provides the answer to the issue raised in paragraph 89. The Court
concluded that,

      “[i]n such a case, since it is the nature of the activity actually carried out which
      determines the characterization of the entity engaged in it, the legal person in question
      should be regarded as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty to the extent that
      it is engaged in activities of a commercial nature, even if they do not constitute its
      principal activities”.

Two comments may be made on this very important paragraph. First, the phrase “in such a case”
means that the Court is addressing the situation where an entity engages both in activities of a
commercial nature and in sovereign activities. Second, the phrase “since it is the nature of the activity
actually carried out which determines the characterization of the entity engaged in it” emphasizes
that, for the Court, it is the nature of the activity in which an entity is engaged that determines whether
it is a company. The word “determine” has a special significance. The Concise Oxford Dictionary
gives the meaning of the word “determine” as “decide or settle”. Therefore, by this finding, the Court
concludes that it is the nature of the activity engaged in by an entity that settles the question whether
that entity is a company within the meaning of the Treaty; the nature of the activity settles this
question definitively. The Court makes no reference to the function of the entity or purpose of the
activity. Moreover, the word “since” in the sentence “since it is the nature of the activity actually
carried out which determines the characterization of the entity engaged in it” confirms that there is a
causal relationship between the characterization of an entity as a company under the Treaty and the
nature of the activities carried out by that entity. The statement that “it is the nature of the activity
actually carried out which determines the characterization of the entity engaged in it” is categoric

                                                  -3-

and does not admit of any other determinant in the characterization of an entity as a company, such
as links between the activities and any sovereign function or purpose to which they relate.

        13. Against that background, the opinion now turns to the Court’s Judgment in this phase of
the proceedings. According to the Court, the 2019 Judgment “did not state that, in determining
whether particular activities were of a commercial nature, there was no need to take into account any
link that they may have with a sovereign function” (Judgment, para. 51). The Judgment adds that
when an entity carries out a transaction or a series of transactions, that transaction — or series of
transactions — must be placed in its context, “taking particular account of any links that it may have
with the exercise of a sovereign function”. To begin with, the Court did indeed hold in its
2019 Judgment that, in determining whether particular activities are of a commercial nature, account
should not be taken of any link that such activities may have with sovereign activity. The Court so
held when it stated that “it is the nature of the activity actually carried out which determines the
characterization of the entity engaged in it”. As stated before, a proper reading of the 2019 Judgment
is that the Court concluded that the nature of the activity settles definitively the question whether an
entity is a company within the meaning of the Treaty. In its present Judgment, the Court has moved
away from its analysis and conclusions in its 2019 Judgment, and has introduced an element not to
be found in the 2019 Judgment, i.e. links between the activity and a sovereign function or purpose.

       14. In paragraph 47, the Court indicates that it would determine whether Bank Markazi is a
company within the meaning of the Treaty of Amity, “following the line of reasoning it adopted in
its 2019 Judgment”. Regrettably, the Judgment did not follow that line of reasoning. Had it done so,
its sole focus would have been on the nature of the activities carried out by Bank Markazi; such a
focus would have led to the conclusion that Bank Markazi was a company since, by its nature, the
purchase of the 22 security entitlements was a commercial activity.

       15. Moreover, and one says this with respect, there would appear to be an element of
disingenuousness in the last sentence of paragraph 52: “The Court nevertheless considers that the
assertions made by Bank Markazi in the judicial proceedings in the Peterson case, which are cited
above, accurately reflect the reality of the bank’s activities.” In the first place, a question of
consistency arises, since in the first sentence of that paragraph, the Court indicated that it did not
consider “the statements made in United States court proceedings by counsel for Bank Markazi and
relied on by the United States . . . to be decisive”. The Court’s statement in the last sentence of this
paragraph flies in the face of its earlier statement in the same paragraph. It could only conclude that
the statements made by Bank Markazi in the Peterson case “accurately reflect the reality of the bank’s
activities” if it treated as consequential, and therefore decisive, the position taken by the bank in that
case, that the purchase of the 22 security entitlements was a sovereign governmental function, entitled
to immunity. The Court ought to have been more transparent by stating that both Parties changed
their positions after the Court, in its 2019 Judgment, found that it had no jurisdiction in respect of the
question of the sovereign immunity of the Bank. In the Peterson proceedings before the US district
court, the bank argued that it had sovereign immunity and the United States contended that the
purchase of the 22 security entitlements was a commercial act, a position with which the US district
court agreed. However, in the present case on the merits, the bank has argued that the purchase of
the 22 security entitlements was a commercial act, while the United States has contended that the
purchase was a sovereign governmental function. The Court should not have joined this strategic,
tactical and inconsequential interplay between the Parties.

       16. In light of the foregoing, the Court should have confirmed its jurisdiction with regard to
the third preliminary objection of the United States.

      17. I do not agree with the conclusion, in paragraph 143 of the Judgment, that the
United States’ conduct does not “constitute a serious failure in the administration of justice
amounting to a denial of justice”.

       18. In the Peterson enforcement proceedings (2013), the plaintiffs sought from the court orders
to attach assets of Iran and Bank Markazi. During the course of these proceedings, the United States
Congress passed legislation, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
(ITRSHRA), which in Section 502 rendered subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution
certain financial assets to satisfy judgments against Iran. The Act states that these assets are “the
financial assets that are identified in and the subject of proceedings in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in Peterson et al. v. Islamic Republic of Iran et al.”. In other
words, the legislation was specifically enacted to influence what was an ongoing trial before the
district court.

       19. In its judgment, the district court, relying on the 2012 ITRSHRA, ruled that the financial
assets should be turned over to the plaintiffs 1. This was done despite the fact that Bank Markazi was
not itself alleged to have been involved in any underlying terrorist activity. Following the judgment
of the United States Court of Appeal upholding the decision of the district court, Bank Markazi
appealed to the United States Supreme Court which, in a majority judgment of seven to two, found
in favour of the plaintiffs. The majority found the introduction of the legislation in the middle of the
case unobjectionable, on the basis that there was a domestic precedent that found that legislation
enacted during ongoing cases was lawful; this legislation “applied to cases identified by caption and
docket number” 2. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sotomayor, the two dissenters, opined that
Section 502 “chang[ed] the law — for these proceedings alone — simply to guarantee that
respondents win” 3. The law was changed by ITRSHRA because, up to the time of its enactment, it
was not beyond question that Bank Markazi’s financial assets were subject to execution or
attachment to satisfy judgments against Iran. Indeed, the majority judgment of the United States
Supreme Court itself observed that the legislation was enacted “[t]o place beyond dispute the
availability of some of the Executive Order No. 13599-blocked assets for satisfaction of judgments
rendered in terrorism cases” 4.

       20. The intrusion of the legislature, Congress, in the middle of the proceedings to enact
legislation that changed the law, which was done, in the words of the dissenters, “simply to guarantee
that respondents win”, was a raw exercise of legislative power that constitutes a denial of justice.
Bank Markazi commenced its defence with the law in one place and ended it with the law in another.
There was a denial of justice because the enactment of legislation during the proceedings interfered
with its fairness in a manner that fundamentally affects the international rule of law by favouring one
party over another in the proceeding. There was a denial of justice because the insertion of the law
in the middle of the proceedings went beyond a “mere misapplication of the law” (see, for example,
Krederi Ltd. v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/17, paras. 468-472).

       21. The United States is correct in its contention “that there is a high threshold for
demonstrating a denial of justice, requiring a notoriously unjust or egregious violation in the
administration of justice which offends a sense of judicial propriety” (Judgment, para. 142). But it is
not correct in its assertion that “there is nothing unjust or egregious about the measures in question”
(para. 142). The introduction of legislation in the middle of an ongoing trial for the express purpose
of assisting a party in that trial is quintessentially the kind of violation in the administration of justice
that offends a sense of judicial propriety.


       22. The dissenters in the Peterson case concluded that the effect of the introduction of the
ITRSHRA in the middle of the case was that the decision in the case was made by the legislature,
and not by the judiciary. Indeed, the interference brought about a miscarriage of justice. If the right
to fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) means anything, it must mean that an Iranian company
involved in litigation in the United States has the right to a fair hearing. Fair and equitable treatment,
in accordance with Article IV, calls for just, unbiased and equitable conduct in the treatment of
nationals and companies engaging in trade and investment between the two countries. Moreover, a
retroactive law, enacted without compelling reasons, violates the legal certainty that the FET standard
would require.


        23. The combined effect of Section 502 of ITRSHRA and the judgment of the district court,
consequentially attaching the property of Bank Markazi, is that the enactment of legislation during
the Peterson case was a denial of justice that breached the bank’s right to fair and equitable treatment,
to which, consistent with my dissent, it was entitled. The existence of a domestic precedent that
would make such enactment lawful as a matter of US domestic law does not imply that such
legislative action would be consistent with the international obligations of the United States as a party
to a treaty. By virtue of Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which
reflects customary international law, a State cannot invoke the provisions of its internal law as
justification for its failure to perform its obligations under a treaty.

      24. The views expressed on unilateral economic sanctions are in no way to be construed as a
commentary on the merits of the present case, in which the applicable law is the Treaty of Amity
and, more generally, the law of treaties. In this part of the separate opinion, I address sanctions under
general international law.


       25. It is accepted that the international community of States is disorganized. The hope that the
post-Second World War era would usher in a period of international co-operation 5 has not been
realized, and, regrettably, the principle of State sovereignty still prevails. In contrast to the position
within a State, there is no single body that reigns supreme in the relationship between States. All the
forces are centrifugal, and today it is debatable whether the international community of States is more
organized, more unified than it was before 1945. Generally, each State insists upon the exercise of
its sovereignty at the expense of international co-operation.

    26. In its work on State responsibility, the International Law Commission (“ILC” or
“Commission”) addresses unilateral economic sanctions under the concept of countermeasures.




       5  Under Article 1 (3) of the Charter, one of the purposes of the United Nations is “to achieve international
co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character”.

                                                         -6-

Interestingly, Special Rapporteur Roberto Ago’s proposed term “sanctions” was replaced by
“countermeasures” 6.


       27. Article 22 of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility (the “ILC’s Articles”) addresses
countermeasures as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under Chapter V, as follows: “The
wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another
State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter
State in accordance with chapter II of part three.”

       28. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros case, the Court confirmed that the fundamental requirement
for the lawfulness of a countermeasure is that it must be “taken in response to a previous
internationally wrongful act of another State” and “directed against that State” 7. This requirement is
reflected in Article 49 of the ILC’s Articles. Here, the Commission’s conclusions are consistent with
the Court’s findings in Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros. Article 50 identifies certain obligations, such as those
relating to the protection of fundamental human rights, that are not affected by countermeasures.
Article 51 addresses the need for the countermeasures to be “commensurate with the injury suffered,
taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question”. Here
again, the Commission’s Articles are consistent with Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros. With regard to the
conditions relating to resort to countermeasures, Article 52 of the Commission’s Articles provides as
follows:

              “1. Before taking countermeasures, an injured State shall:

      (a) Call upon the responsible State, in accordance with article 43, to fulfil its obligations
          under part two;

      (b) Notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to
          negotiate with that State.

            2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 (b), the injured State may take such urgent
      countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights.

            3. Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended
      without undue delay if:

      (a) The internationally wrongful act has ceased; and

      (b) The dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make
          decisions binding on the parties.

            4. Paragraph 3 does not apply if the responsible State fails to implement the
      dispute settlement procedures in good faith.”

       29. It is not altogether clear whether the conditions relating to resort to countermeasures set
out in Article 52 have a customary character.


       30. Some may question whether any of the economic sanctions unilaterally imposed by States
over the last sixty years meet the requirements set out in Articles 49, 50, 51 and 52. Certainly, there
would be a question whether they meet the proportionality test in Article 51. Additionally, to the
extent that unilaterally determined economic measures adversely affect the poor, the sick and the
vulnerable in the State against which they are taken, there may be a question whether they meet the
requirement in Article 50 (1) (b) for countermeasures not to affect “obligations for the protection of
fundamental human rights”.

      31. In the 1986 Military and Paramilitary Activities case, the Court had to address Nicaragua’s
claim that the United States had violated the principle of non-intervention by the economic sanctions
it imposed, including a cut-off of economic aid and a 90 per cent reduction in Nicaragua’s sugar
quota for imports into the United States. The Court concluded that it had “merely to say that it is
unable to regard such action on the economic plane as is here complained of as a breach of the
customary-law principle of non-intervention” 8.

       32. An interesting question is whether, in light of the developments that have taken place since
the 1986 Military and Paramilitary Activities Judgment, the Court would today respond in the way
that it did in that case to a State’s claim that unilaterally imposed sanctions are in breach of the
principle of non-intervention. There is no question about the customary character of the principle of
non-intervention; this is acknowledged by the Court itself in Military and Paramilitary Activities.
The difficult question relates to the legality of unilaterally imposed sanctions. In that regard, there
have been three important developments since 1986. First, in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros case, the
Court held that Czechoslovakia’s assumption of control of the Danube river did not respect the
proportionality that is required by international law, and therefore the diversion of the Danube was
not a lawful countermeasure. It is safe to say that the requirement of proportionality is now a part of
customary international law.


       33. The second development is the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility. In my view, even
if there may be some doubt as to whether Articles 50 and 52 have customary status, there can be no
doubt that Articles 49 and 51 reflect customary international law. Article 49 requires that
countermeasures may only be taken against a State which is responsible for an internationally
wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations under Part Two of the ILC’s
Articles; and Article 51 requires proportionality in the imposition of unilaterally determined
countermeasures.

       34. The third development is the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council on the
topic of human rights and unilateral coercive measures. Relying, inter alia, on the declarations
contained in UNGA resolution 2131 (XX) and resolution 2625 (XXV), the United Nations Human
Rights Council, on 26 September 2014 adopted resolution 27/21 and Corr. 1 on human rights and
unilateral coercive measures. The most recent renewal of the resolution was on October 2020, HRC
resolution 45/5. The resolutions of the United Nations Human Rights Council stress that unilateral
coercive measures and practices are contrary to international law, international humanitarian law, the
United Nations Charter and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, and
highlights that in the long term, these measures may result in social problems and raise humanitarian


       8 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits,

Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 126, para. 245.

                                                  -8-

concerns in the States targeted. More specifically, in the resolution adopted on 26 September 2014,
the United Nations Human Rights Council strongly objected to the extraterritorial nature of unilateral
coercive measures “which . . . threaten the sovereignty of States” and condemned “the continued
unilateral application and enforcement by certain powers of such measures as tools of political or
economic pressure against any country”.


       35. In my view, these three developments since the 1986 Military and Paramilitary Activities
signal a departure from the era of unfettered resort to unilateral economic sanctions. Indeed, when
these developments are viewed in light of the United Nations General Assembly’s past efforts to
develop a norm prohibiting the use of economic sanctions as an instrument of political pressure or
coercion, there is a case for concluding that unilateral economic sanctions which are disproportionate,
or coercive, do not qualify as countermeasures within the meaning of the ILC’s Articles and may be
as violative of the customary principle of non-intervention as military measures. If today the Court
were faced with the question that was posed in 1986, in making its determination, it would have to
take into consideration the developments outlined.


       36. In conclusion, the disorganization of the international community of States explains the
phenomenon of unilaterally imposed sanctions. They are particularly objectionable when it is clear
from the context in which they are imposed that they are performing a function that the United
Nations Charter assigned to the Security Council. It is the dysfunctionality of the Security Council,
resulting from the veto power of the five permanent members, that creates a void which States bent
on asserting their sovereignty are only too ready to fill.

       37. In addressing the United States’ objection to admissibility based on the failure to exhaust
local remedies, the Judgment states that, “for the reasons set out below, the Court is persuaded that
the companies in question did not have any effective means of redress, in the legal system of the
United States, that they failed to pursue” (para. 67, my emphasis). In its analysis, the Court relied on
the customary rule, set out in Article 15, paragraph (a), of the ILC’s Articles on Diplomatic
Protection, that the requirement to exhaust local remedies is satisfied when there are no available
local remedies providing the injured persons with a reasonable possibility of obtaining redress. The
Court cites favourably Iran’s submission that “according to settled United States jurisprudence,
where there is an explicit inconsistency between a treaty and a statute adopted later than that treaty,
the statute is deemed to have abrogated the treaty in United States law” (Judgment, para. 69). After
noting that the United States did not attempt to contest the validity of that assertion, the Court cited
the Weinstein proceedings as an example of a case in which a statute trumped the Treaty of Amity.

       38. It is astonishing that in light of the clarity of this analysis, the Court could only conclude,
in paragraph 72 of the Judgment, that “it appears to the Court that, in the circumstances of the present
case, the companies in question had no reasonable possibility of successfully asserting their rights in
United States court proceedings” (my emphasis). Bearing in mind that the Court is responding to a
preliminary objection to admissibility, its conclusion should have been more categoric in this
semi-final part of its analysis. Its reasoning may be criticized on two grounds. First, the weak,
uncertain and hesitant finding, “it appears to the Court”, conflicts with the earlier statement in
paragraph 67 that the Court was “persuaded that the companies in question did not have any effective
means of redress, in the legal system of the United States, that they failed to pursue” (my emphasis).
This is a clear and categoric statement indicating that the Court was convinced that Iranian companies
did not have any effective means of redress. Second, the weak, uncertain and hesitant finding, “it
appears to the Court”, does not provide a basis for the conclusion in paragraph 73: “For the foregoing
reasons, the Court concludes that the objection to admissibility based on the failure to exhaust local

                                                              -9-

remedies cannot be upheld.” This unambiguous conclusion cannot be derived from the hesitant
formulation in the previous paragraph.


       39. The Court ought to have found that, “[g]iven the combination of the legislative character
of the contested measures and the primacy accorded to a more recent federal statute over the treaty
in the jurisprudence of the United States”, the Court is persuaded “that, in the circumstances of the
present case, the companies in question had no reasonable possibility of successfully asserting their
rights in United States court proceedings”.


       40. It is noteworthy that the Court does not employ a similar formulation, “it appears to the
Court”, in disposing of the United States’ objection to jurisdiction or any of its defences on the merits.
