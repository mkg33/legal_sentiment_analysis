1. Although (if with some reluctance) I agree and have voted with the
majority of the Court in finding the Belgian claim in this case to be in-
admissible, and broadly for the principal reason on which the Judgment
is based—namely that in respect of an injury done to a company, prima
facie the company’s government alone can sustain an international
claim—I have a somewhat different attitude on various aspects of the
matter, which I wish to indicate. In particular (a) I would go consider-
ably further than does the Judgment in accepting limitations on the
principle of the “hegemony” of the company and its government;—
furthermore (5), though I have felt bound to vote as I have, I nevertheless
hold it to be an unsatisfactory state of the law that obliges the Court to
refrain from pronouncing on the substantive merits of the Belgian claim,
on the basis of what is really—at least in the actual circumstances of this
case—somewhat of a technicality.

4. Although, as I have said, I reach the same final conclusion as in the
Judgment of the Court, my approach is different. In particular I do not
base myself as does the Judgment to some extent (vide its paragraphs
33-36), and as figured fairly prominently in the arguments of the Parties,
on any consideration turning on the question of to whom, or to what
entity, was the obligation owed in this case, not to act in a manner

? Although I now agree with my colleague Judge Morelli’s view that the question
of Belgium’s right to claim on behalf of the Barcelona Traction Company’s share-
holders, in so far as Belgian, is really a question of substance not of capacity (because
the underlying issue is what rights do the shareholders themselves have), it is
convenient for immediate purposes to treat the matter as one of Belgian Government
standing.



contrary to international law. This does not seem to me to be the right
question to ask where the issue involved is not one of treaty or other
particular obligations, but of general international law obligations in the
sphere of the treatment of foreigners. If in the latter area a State, either
directly or through its agencies or authorities, acts illicitly, it stands in
breach of international law irrespective of whether any other State is
qualified to take the matter up. For instance if an individual were
concerned, he might be stateless. If in the present case there have been
contraventions of international law, they are in no way legitimized, nor
do they become any the less illicit, because Canada has not (or even
possibly could not 3) pursue the matter, and because Belgium is held to
possess no locus standi in judicio for doing so. Nor is the question of the
entity to which the obligation is due helpful even for the purpose of
identifying the party entitled to claim, for such entity would itself
previously need to be identified, and the discussion would turn in a circle.

5. The material and only pertinent question is who or what entity, if, any
is entitled to claim in respect of damage accruing to shareholders in conse-
quence of illicit treatment of the company;—and in order to answer this
since the matter concerns a company and its shareholders—it is above all
necessary to have regard to the concept and structure of companies
according to the systems of their origin, which are systems of private
or domestic law,—and furthermore to insist on the principle that when
private law concepts are utilized, or private law institutions are dealt
with in the international legal field, they should not there be distorted
or handled in a manner not in conformity with their true character, as it
exists under the system or systems of their creation. But, although this
is so, it is scarcely less important to bear in mind that conditions in the
international field are sometimes very different from what they are in
the domestic, and that rules which these latter conditions fully justify
may be less capable of vindication if strictly applied when transposed
onto the international level *. Neglect of this precaution may result in an

exists according to the applicable private law concepts °. Fundamental
to the structure of the company is the ascription to it, qua corporate
entity, of a separate personality over and above that of its component
parts, viz. the shareholders, with resulting carefully drawn distinctions
between the sphere, functions and rights of the company as such, acting
through its management or board, and those of the shareholder. These
distinctions must obviously be maintained at the international level:
indeed to do otherwise would be completely to travesty the notion of a
company as a corporate entity. Thus it is that, just as in domestic courts
no shareholder could take proceedings in respect of a tort or breach
of contract committed in respect of the company, but only the latter
could do so, through the action of its management with whom the
decision would lie—a decision which, broadly speaking, the shareholder
must accept,—so also if an illicit act injurious to the company or in-
fringing its rights takes place on the international plane, it is not the
government of the shareholder but, in principle, that of the company
alone, which can make an international claim or bring international
proceedings ;—the decision whether to do so or not lying with the latter
government—a decision which again the foreign shareholder must accept,
in the sense that neither he nor his government can require (still less
compel) the company’s government to take action.

the company recoils or “‘repercusses” onto the shareholder 5, e.g., by

it finds it. The complaint I am making in this Opinion is that international law has
indeed taken it as it has found it over part of the ground, but not over the rest,
thereby introducing an unjustified distortion.

5 It is inevitable that these concepts should be referred to herein in very broad and
general terms. The details vary from country to country, and some things may not be
true or may need considerable qualification for certain countries.

6 Suppose that by the tortious negligence of a third party the company’s ware-
houses are burned down,—the shareholder may indirectly be seriously affected, but
he can have no right of action: the property was not his but the company’s. It is the
same if his interest is affected by the failure of a third party to carry out a contract
with the company, for he himself is not a party to the contract. It is quite another
matter if the act complained of is directed against, or directly infringes, his specific



causing the market value of his shares to fall or the profits of the company
to be diminished—whence lower dividends; or by causing difficulty as to
disposing of the shares—(for want of ready buyers),—for while the
shareholder has a legal right not to have his shares cancelled or confisca-
ted without compensation, he has no legal right that they shall have,
or be maintained at, any particular market value,—and while the share-
holder has a right to receive a dividend if a dividend is declared, he has
no right that it shall be declared, or (if declared) be for any particular
amount ”,—and again, while he has a right freely to dispose of his
shares 8, the law does not guarantee him either a buyer or a price.

8. But at this point it becomes clear that something has gone wrong,—
that the analogy has broken down,—because certain qualifications or
modifications, it might be said mitigations, which, in the domestic field,
affect and as it were alleviate the situation just described, are not, in
the present state of the law, reflected, or not adequately so, in the inter-
national domain ;—for whereas at that level this situation is one which,
as the law now seems to stand, may leave the shareholder powerless to
protect his interests, this is not the case on the domestic plane, where
the principle of the “hegemony” of the company is accompanied by
certain balancing elements, acting as a counterweight, which are only
up to a point reflected in the present condition of international law—
(vide infra, paragraph 11 and the footnotes thereto).

9. In order to understand this matter, it is necessary to have regard to
the underlying rationale of the “hegemony principle”. This resides in
something more than the purely juridical situation resulting from the
separate legal personality of the company, and the fact that, in the type
of case now in question, the rights infringed are those of the company,
not of the shareholder—though his pocket may be affected, actually or
potentially—(vide supra, paragraph 7 and footnote 6). Nor does it reside
in the practical considerations which, on the domestic plane, at least,
must in all normal circumstances rule out the possibility of separate and
independent action by shareholders in respect of the treatment of the
company, as such, by third parties.

company rights is that, normally, he does not need this. The company
will act and, by so doing, will automatically protect not only its own
interests but those of the shareholders also. That is the assumption; —
namely that the company is both capable of acting and will do so unless
there are cogent reasons why, in the interests of the company and, hence,
indirectly of the shareholders, it should refrain °,—the decision involved
being one of policy, prima facie for the determination of the management.
(It is precisely here, however, that the beginnings of a profound difference
between the domestic and the international situations can be discerned,
for if and when a government declines or fails to intervene on behalf of
a company of its nationality detrimentally affected by illicit foreign
action, the reasons will be the government’s not the company’s 1°, and will
normally have nothing to do with the company’s interests, which indeed
are likely to be adversely affected still further by the government’s
refusal or failure, so that no contingent or long-term advantage, or
avoidance of disadvantage, will result, as might be expected if the
decision were the company’s. The motivations involved are quite distinct.
But all this is to anticipate.)

Such provisions of course differ from country to country but, without
attempting to particularize, their broad effect is either to enable share-
holders to bring an action in their own names against a third party, in a
variety of circumstances involving fraud, malfeasance, negligence or

parties, continues as follows:

“Where, however, the persons against whom relief is sought hold and control
the majority of the shares, and will not permit an action to be brought in the
company’s name, shareholders complaining may bring an action in their own
names and on behalf of the others and they may do so also where the effect of
preventing them so suing would be to enable a company by an ordinary re-
solution to ratify an improperly passed special resolution.”

law limitations on the exclusive power of the management, allowing of
independent action by the shareholders, are reflected at the international
level, so as correspondingly to qualify the principle of the exclusive right
of the government of the company to intervene, and admitting the
possibility of intervention by that of the shareholders, even though the
injury is to the company as such, rather than to any independent stricto
sensu shareholding right. This question has to be asked because, if it is

indicate the position under English law (loc. cit., pp. 222-223, omitting references to
footnotes):

“458. Statutory right of members collectively. The members of a company
collectively have statutory rights, some of which are exercisable by a bare
majority, as, for instance, a resolution at the statutory meeting; others by a
particular majority, as in the case of a reconstruction; and others by a minority,
as in the case of a requisition for a meeting of shareholders, or of an application
to the Board of Trade to appoint an inspector to investigate the company’s
affairs, or of an application by an oppressed minority to the court for relief.

Statutory rights cannot be taken away or modified by any provisions of the
memorandum or articles [i.e., of the company].”

law include his right . . . to restrain directors from acting ultra vires the company

not right that international law should distort the structure of the
company (an essentially private law concept) by failing to give all due
effect to the logic of its separate personality, distinct from that of the
shareholders,—it is no less wrong, and an equal distortion, if international
law fails to give due effect to the limitations on this principle recognized
by the very system which, mutatis mutandis, it is sought to apply on the
international plane. In short, such application should be integral, not
partial. But is it?—or is it not rather the case that international law,
while purporting to base itself on, and to be guided by the relevant fea-
tures of municipal law, really does so only toa certain extent, departing
from it at precisely that point where, under municipal law the manage-
ment of the company can in certain circumstances be compelled by
the shareholders to act?

or less definitely admitted that intervention by the government of foreign
shareholders is allowable, namely where the company concerned has the
nationality !* of the very State responsible for the acts or damage com-
plained of, and these, or the resulting circumstances, are such as to
render the company incapable de facto of protecting its interests and
hence those of the shareholders !*. Clearly in this type of case no inter-
vention or claim on behalf of the company as such can, in the nature of
things, be possible at the international level, since the company has local
not foreign nationality, and since also the very authority to which the
company should be able to look for support or protection is itself the
author of the damage. Consequently, the normal rule of intervention
only on behalf of the company by the company’s government becomes
not so much inapplicable as irrelevant or meaningless in the context.
The efficacity of the corporate entity and its capability of useful action
has broken down, and the shareholders become as it were substituted
for the management to protect the company’s interests by any method
legally open to them. If some of them have foreign nationality, one
such way is to invoke the intervention of their government, and in
the circumstances this must be regarded as admissible. Thus the same

14 For present purposes I am taking the nationality of a company to be that of the
country of incorporation, the laws of which govern the company’s constitution and
functioning. However, vide infra paras. 33 and 34.

15 If the wrong done to the company, or breach of contract with it, comes not
from another private party but from the authorities of the country, it is again in
principle only the company which can take legal action, to the extent that the local
law allows the government to be sued. If however, as happened for instance in the
El Triunfo case (United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. XV,
p. 464), the action taken against the company by the authorities has the effect of
completely paralyzing it, then the shareholders can act and, if they are unable to
obtain redress locally, but have foreign nationality, can, according to the view here
discussed as being now more or less generally recognized, invoke the aid and inter-
vention of their government.



authority as was cited in paragraph 11 above continues (translation) 1°:

“.., From this it necessarily results that if the rational justification
for the mechanism of the corporate entity is brought to a collapse
by the act of the very State whose law governs the status and
allegiance of the corporate entity, its personality is no longer
anything but a fiction void of all meaning, in which there can now
be seen nothing but a bundle of individual rights.”

15. Notwithstanding these cogent considerations of principle, the
validity of this exception to or limitation on the rule of non-intervention
by the government of the shareholders in respect of wrongs done to the
company, is contested on a variety of grounds. It is said for instance that
this type of intervention on behalf of foreign shareholders ought only
to be permissible where the company itself is also essentially foreign as
to its management and control, and the nature of the interests it covers,
and where its local nationality did not result from voluntary incorporation
locally, but was imposed on it by the government of the country or by a
provision of its local law as a condition of operating there, or of receiving
a concession. In such cases, it is said, the company’s nationality is an
artificial one that does not correspond with the underlying realities,
and for this reason (but for this reason only) the local government should
not be able to avail itself of the obstacle of its nationality which it has
designedly insisted on interposing between itself and those realities—
possibly for the express purpose of preventing foreign intervention.
Where however the local nationality was deliberately assumed by the
company as a matter of choice, then, so it is said, there is no reason for
making any such departure from the basic rule of the company screen.

16. It is doubtless true that it is in the case of such “enforced” local
nationality that situations leading to foreign shareholders in the company
invoking the intervention of their government are most liable to arise.
Nevertheless, there does not seem to be any sufficient reason of principle
for drawing the distinction involved. The fact of local incorporation,
but with foreign shareholding, remains the same in both types of case,
whatever the motivations or processes that brought it about. Nor are the
motivations which lead foreign interests to seek or not seek local nation-
ality always easy to assess: they may be very mixed. Nor again is it
always the case that companies with a large foreign shareholding, and
mainly controlled from abroad, do not voluntarily obtain local in-
corporation: they often do, and there may be sound business reasons
for it. Yet they are just as liable in practice to be regarded locally as

16 Loc. cit. in footnote 11 supra.


“In sum, in order to weigh the admissibility of the protection of
shareholders, it is necessary to adhere essentially to the idea of the
effectiveness of the corporate entity. It matters little whether,
according to internal law criteria, the corporal personality subsists
or not. Even where it does, an international tribunal can admit the

17 Loc. cit. in footnote 11 supra, at p. 477.



diplomatic protection of shareholders from the moment when it
finds as a fact that the damage caused to the corporate entity has
had the effect of paralysing or sterilising the usefulness that the
mechanism of corporate personality ought normally to bring about
for the benefit of the shareholders.

In that case, an international tribunal, not being bound by internal
law criteria, ‘pierces the corporate veil’, as it is said, [but] it would
be more accurate to say that it registers the absence of all effective
personality, of any effectual intermediary between the shareholders
and the rights infringed.”

These two paragraphs moreover, even if only in general terms, almost

the Belgian claim? In the present state of the law it would seem that it
must. In connection with this conclusion, however, a number of points
have to be considered in order to show why, although it is correct on the
basis of extant law, this law itself, as it now stands, is in this respect
unsatisfactory.

22. The first of these points is that, as required by the logic of the
considerations indicated in paragraphs 5 to 13 supra, if on the domestic
plane there are circumstances in which some action is open to the share-
holders notwithstanding that it is prima facie the company’s position,
rather than (directly) their own, that is in question,—then in correspond-
ing circumstances the government of the shareholders should, on the
international plane, be entitled to intervene and claim. One such case
has already been discussed supra in paragraphs 14-20: the company
is defunct or paralyzed and there can be no question of intervention
or claim by its government, for the latter is itself the tortfeasor govern-
ment, if wrong there has been. Similarly, if international law is to remain
faithful to the concept of the company and, in dealing with the latter
on the international plane, is to give due effect to its essential elements,
then it must provide for the case where the company’s government—
not being the tortfeasor government (but also not being the government
of the majority of the shareholders)—for reasons of its own that have
nothing to do with the interests of the company (see supra paragraph 10)
refuses or fails to intervene, even though there may be a good, or ap-
parently good case in law for doing so, and the interests of the company
require it. Just as on the domestic plane an analogous failure or refusal
on the part of the management of the company would normally enable
the shareholders to act, either (if the element of dolus or culpa were
present) by legal action against the management, or against the tortfeasor
or contract-breaking third party,—or else through the internal processes
of the company ;—so also, on the international plane, ought the inaction
of the company’s government enable that of the shareholders to act—
(and obviously there would be ways of resolving the practical difficulties
of the company’s government subsequently changing its mind—if the
servants of the law cared to work them out;—I think that in this respect
paragraphs 94-98 of the Court’s Judgment make too much of this
matter).

23. In fact, international law does not at present allow of this—
except possibly in the one case of the company’s government being
actually disqualified at law from acting (as to which see infra, paragraphs
26-32). The reasons for this insufficiency—for such it is—may be perfectly
understandable, but this does not alter the fact that international law
is in this respect an under-developed system as compared with private
law, and that it fails to provide the recourses necessary for protecting

that a government is not in the same position as a company and cannot
be made subject to the same constraints. The management of a company
owes a duty, not only to the company but to the shareholders, and is
bound to act in the best interests of the company, and hence of the
shareholders, basing itself on an informed and well-weighed estimate
of what these are. A government is under no such duty. It is perfectly
free on policy grounds to ignore the interests of the company or even
to act in a manner it knows to be contrary to these; and if it does this,
there are no international means of recourse against it, such as there
would be against the management of a company so acting on the internal
plane. There is no means, internationally, of proceeding against a gov-
ernment which refuses to intervene on behalf of, or support, the claim
of one of its nationals or national companies ?,—nor could such a
refusal conceivably entail the breach of any general international law
obligation. Still less of course is there any means of changing or replacing
a government which refuses or fails to act as, internally, the shareholders
may be able to do as regards the company’s management.

24. All this at present provides an excuse for saying, as the law now
does, that if the company’s government does not act no other one can.
Instead, it should constitute a reason for coming to precisely the opposite
conclusion. An enlightened rule, while recognizing that the national
government of the company can never be required to intervene, and that
its reasons for not doing so cannot be questioned even though they may
have nothing to do with the merits of the claim, would simply provide
that in such event the government of the shareholders may do so *—
particularly if, as is frequently the case, it is just because the shareholding
is mainly foreign that the government of the company feels that no
sufficient national interest exists to warrant intervention on its own

20 Theoretically, the internal law of the country concerned might provide a means
of recourse against the government in such circumstances: and political action might
be possible. But in neither case would the essential point be affected.

2! Tam not greatly impressed by the point which comes up in several connections
that the Belgian position, with a big block of majority shareholding, is peculiar, and
that in other cases there might be foreign shareholders of several nationalities and a
consequent multiplicity of claims. This would only go to the quantum of reparation
recoverable by the various governments,—and once the principle of claims on behalf
of shareholders had been admitted for such circumstances, it would not be difficult
to work out ways of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, which is what would
really matter.



part 22, The law’s present attitude is based on predicating for the com-
pany’s government not merely a prima facie right (which would be
understandable) but an exclusive one (which is not). There is no reason
of principle why, if the law so wills, failure to utilize a right of action
by the party prima facie entitled to do so should not sanction its exercise
by another party whose material interest in the matter may actually be
greater. Practical difficulties there might be; but this is not a serious
objection where no inherent necessity of the law stands in the way.
That such a situation of primary and secondary (or latent) entitlement
to act can work, if properly regulated, seems to be indicated by the
shareholders’ possibilities of action on the domestic plane, as earlier
described.

The Nottebohm case

26. There remains however a quite different order of point, which is
in my view by far the most important to arise on the question of Belgian
locus standi, namely what the situation would be if Canada, instead of
having merely failed to pursue the case, were actually to be unable to
do so because of a legal disability created by international law itself,
disqualifying Canada from acting. It is one thing for the law to predicate,
-on the basis of an exclusive right of action for one government, that
even in the event of its not being exercised, no other government may
exercise it. Such a position may be regrettable, for the reasons I have
indicated, but is at least tenable. What would be totally inadmissible
would be for the law simultaneously to confer a right, yet disqualify the
indicated government from exercising it in certain circumstances, and
then, when these arise and the disqualification operates, continue to
maintain the rule of exclusivity and the consequent incapacity of the
governments of other parties whose interest in the matter is undeniable.
Implicitly the Judgment takes the same view because an important part
of it (see preceding paragraph) rests on the basis that so long as it is
possible for the company’s government to claim (whether it chooses to do
so or not) the shareholders are not, at least in Jaw, deprived of all chance
of protection.

27. These aspects are particularly important if consideration is given
to what the ground of Canada’s possible disqualification would be,
namely (on the basis of certain previous decisions and other elements 2)
that there was an absence of a sufficiently close link between the Canadian
Government and the Barcelona Company to give the former an action-
able interest at law. Moreover, a major factor would precisely be the
absence of any Canadian shareholding or share capital in the Company
and the fact that most of it was Belgian. In my view, a disqualification—

24 In particular the decision of the Court in the Nottebohm case (merits)—I.C.J.
Reports 1955, p. 4 et seq.; and the Report of the Commission of Arbitration in the
“I’m Alone” case (U.N. Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. TITI, p. 1614).
The same sort of questions also arise over the use of flags of convenience; supposed
head-offices that are no more than an address and a letter-box; etc.

29. In the Nottebohm case, in which Liechtenstein was claiming
against Guatemala, the three main grounds on which the Court found
against Liechtenstein’s capacity to put forward the claim of Mr. Notte-
bohm were:

(i) that this Liechtenstein nationality—acquired by naturalization
just before the outbreak of war in 1939, he being then a German

25 See reference in footnote 24 above.



national—was purely artificial, in the sense that he had not
acted from any real desire to identify himself with Liechtenstein
and its fortunes, but with the ulterior object of endeavouring
to divest himself of enemy character by acquiring neutral
status;

(ii) that his true connection by residence, domicile and business
interests was Guatemalan; and

(iii) that it was precisely against Guatemala that the claim was
being brought.

In these circumstances the Court held that although Mr. Nottebohm
was undoubtedly of Liechtenstein nationality under the law of that
State, such nationality could not be regarded as entitling Liechtenstein
to make a claim on his behalf against Guatemala %;—or in other words
his claim was not “opposable’’ to Guatemala at the instance of Liech-
tenstein, which meant that Liechtenstein was in those particular circum-
stances disqualified.

of Barcelona Traction some 20 years ago,—whereas it must be at least
doubtful how far this could operate as a positive admission of a Canadian
right now to present a diplomatic claim on behalf of the Company
(if that occurred), in such a way as formally to preclude any Spanish
right of objection under this head. In this context, diplomatic representa-
tions—which need not necessarily be based on or imply a claim of right,
but are often admitted or received in the absence of any such claim or
pretension to it—belong to a different order of international act from
the presentation of a formal claim before an international tribunal.

32. More important is the fact that, if any preclusion operated as a
result of past Spanish non-objection to Canadian intervention (as it
quite possibly might), it could only operate as against Spain in proceed-
ings brought by Canada against the former. It could not possibly operate
against Belgium in proceedings brought by the latter against Spain.
In contrast to the case of Belgium, Spanish non-objection was at least
significant, for Spain at all times had an interest in objecting to Canada’s
intervention, if there were possible legal grounds for so doing. Belgium
did not have any such interest; on the contrary, the true interest of the
Belgian shareholders at all times lay in Canadian intervention on behalf
of the Company: it is precisely the lack of such intervention since about
1952 that has placed the Belgian shareholders in the position in which

applicable to corporate entities as well as to individuals. These questions, and others,
needed to be gone into.



they now find themselves. Consequently no inference adverse to Belgium
can be drawn from the Belgian non-objection to Canada’s ius standi,
for this could not be expected in the circumstances, and was not called
for in proceedings in which the Belgian position essentially was (see
paragraph 46 infra) that irrespective of any Canadian right, Belgium had
a right of claim. It was for the Court, acting proprio motu, as it has the
power to do, to go into this cardinal issue, the silence of the Parties
notwithstanding.

33. While on this part of the case, another question which in my
opinion needed to be considered was whether, in all the circumstances,
the very ‘nationality’ of the Barcelona Company itself should not be
held to be Belgian rather than Canadian. There has, doctrinally, been
much discussion and controversy as to what is the correct test to apply
in order to determine the national status of corporate entities; and
although the better view is that (at least for public as opposed to private
international law and some other purposes) the correct test is that of
the State of incorporation, there is equally no doubt that different
tests have been applied for different purposes, and that an element of
fluidity is still present in this field 2. This being so, it is surely a highly
tenable proposition that the very circumstances which might lead to the
State of incorporation being held to be disqualified from claiming,—
because of the absence of a “genuine link” due to the company’s owner-
ship and control and main business interests being elsewhere,—might
equally tend to suggest that in such a case a different test of nationality
should be applied #°. There are also certain other aspects of the matter
considered in the opening paragraphs of my colleague Judge Gros’
separate Opinion which are highly pertinent to the question of the
national status of companies.

34. I am of course aware that there are difficulties about this view

29 Or else that the proper test of the right to claim internationally should be that
of where the real weight of interest lies. On this matter I associate myself (de lege
ferenda however) with much that is contained in paragraphs 57-70 of my colleague
Judge Jessup’s Opinion.



which would doubtless have been brought out had the matter been
properly argued. My purpose here is to indicate that this is what I
think should have occurred. The Parties should have been requested
to present a full argument on the subject. It was not enough, in my
opinion, to proceed on the basis that since neither Party had contested
the Canadian nationality of the Barcelona Company, and both had
proceeded on the assumption that the Company was Canadian, the
Court was not called upon to speculate otherwise. Such an attitude may
be quite in order in domestic courts where, normally, appeals or alter-
native procedures exist. It is not appropriate to international proceedings
in which, almost always, there are no possibilities of appeals or other
recourses. In this field the principle of caveat actor can be carried too
far, when the point involved is not at all merely incidental but could be
of major importance for the outcome of the case.

the well-known dictum of President Huber in the much cited Ziat, Ben
Kiran case 3°, where what was involved was an entity of the nationality
of the defendant State—a type of case in which the idea of admitting
foreign intervention is really much more startling, conceptually, than it
is in the present type of case. Yet there is a resemblance, and Huber’s
dictum is equally apt (my translation):

“International law which, in this field, draws its inspiration essen-
tially from the principles of equity, has not laid down any formal
criterion for granting or refusing diplomatic protection to national
interests linked to interests belonging to persons of different na-
tionality.”

In the present context the equitable considerations to which the Court
refers in paragraphs 92-101 of the Judgment, stress the need for a less
inelastic treatment of certain of the issues of admissibility involved.

36. The matter can however be put on a broader basis than that
merely of the requirements that may exist in this particular field. As
an old authority (Ménignhac) said in terms even more applicable today—
“international law is to be applied with equity”. There have been a
number of recent indications of the need in the domain of international
law, of a body of rules or principles which can play the same sort of
part internaticnally as the English system of Equity does, or at least
originally did, in the Common Law countries that have adopted it.
Deciding a case on the basis of rules of equity, that are part of the general
system of law applicable, is something quite different from giving a
decision ex aequo et bono, as was indicated by the Court in paragraph 88
of its Judgment in the North Sea Continental Shelf case (I.C.J. Reports
1969, at p. 48), when introducing the considerations which led it to
found its decision in part on equitable considerations, as it might well
have done in the present case also. Be that as it may, I should like to
take this opportunity of placing on record in a volume of the Court’s
Reports a classic short statement of the way in which, historically, the
need for a system of Equity makes itself felt,—taken from a standard
work 3! current in the country in which Equity as a juridical system
originated,—and in language moreover that might almost have been
devised for the case of international law:

“Equity is that body of rules or principles which form[s] an
appendage or gloss to the general rules of law. It represents the

attempt ... of the ... legal system to meet a problem which confronts
all legal systems reaching a certain stage of development. To ensure
the smooth running of society it is necessary to formulate general,
rules which work well enough in the majority of cases. Sooner or
later, however, cases arise in which, in some unforeseen set of facts
the general rules produce substantial unfairness. When this occurs,
justice requires either an amendment of the rule or, if ... the rule
is not freely changeable, a further rule or body of rules to mitigate
the severity of the rules of law.”

It would be difficult to find words more apt to describe the sort of impasse
that arises in circumstances such as those of the present case, which a
system of Equity should be employed to resolve: and, as the author of
the passage cited points out subsequently, equity is not distinguishable
from law “because it seeks a different end, for both aim at justice ...”.
But, it might be added, they can achieve it only if they are allowed to
complement one another.

nationality may be, has been answered in the negative by the Judgment,
and this accordingly disposes of the whole claim. Had the answer been
in the affirmative, however, it would still have been necessary, before
the third preliminary objection could be dismissed and the claim be
held to be admissible (so far as this ground of objection was concerned),
that its national character should be established as being that of the
claimant State. The two classic dicta of the Permanent Court may be
recalled:

*,.. it is the bond of nationality which alone confers upon the State
the right of diplomatic protection . . . 37°

and

“By taking up the case of one of its subjects and by resorting to
diplomatic action or international proceedings on his behalf, a
State is in reality asserting its own right, the right to ensure in the
person of its subjects respect for the rules of international law 33.”

A true question of capacity as such is here involved 3, for without the
“bond of nationality’ and what it entails, the claimant State would lack
the necessary qualification for intervention and claim, since it could not
then be “taking up the case of one of its subjects”, in whose person alone
it could be ‘‘asserting its own right . . . to ensure . . . respect for the rules
of international law”.




tion, or must it also be shown that the individual shareholding in that
company was equally Belgian, or at least predominantly so?—also (ii)
whether a beneficial owner of shares actually vested in nominees or
trustees of non-Belgian nationality, with whom pro tem lies the legal
ownership, still ranks as a “shareholder” while that situation continues;
.and, if not, whether this does not entail such a break in the “ownership of
the claim” as to disqualify the private party concerned, and hence his
government ;—and finally (iii) what are the material times at which the
necessary shareholding status and nationality must exist, and did the
latter in fact do so at these times? Clearly, however, the present discussion
must be confined only to those points that were of especial prominence
in the case.

claim, since the validity of the claim—its legal merits in itself—could not
depend on the size of it in terms of the numbers of shareholders, or of the
financial values involved. The latter could, in law, only affect the quantum



of reparation or damages recoverable if the claim should be made good.
This situation, while it does not exactly shift the burden of proof entirely,
does place it in a different light by suggesting that in some circumstances,
in claims of this kind, the defendant State could only validly contest the
standing of the claimant party if it could show that there was no evidence
of the existence of even one indubitable shareholder of the latter’s nation-
ality, and no reasonable presumption of there being any. This is just the
sort of situation which arises where, as in the present case, the claimant
Party has, over a long period of years, possessed what might be called
a “historic interest’ in a case, the existence of which is and always has
been a matter of common knowledge, constantly acted upon by both
parties, implicitly recognized, and scarcely contested, at least formally,
until international legal proceedings are started. In such circumstances
there is an almost irresistible inference that a substantial body of private
interests exists belonging to the State concerned. But as will be seen in a
moment (infra, paragraph 43) the matter does not in any way depend on
inferences or presumptions.

42. In the present case the attempt to maintain that the Belgian
nationality of the shares had not been established, took a particular form,
which involved not so much denying the existence—or proved existence—
of any Belgian shareholding at all,—as maintaining that the apparent, or
ostensible, Belgian shareholding did not have the requisite character.
Here it is material to note that the shares in the Barcelona Company fall
into three main categories,—the bearer shares; the registered (i.e., non-
bearer) shares standing in the names of various private persons and entities
other than a Belgian incorporated company known as Sidro * for short;
and finally the shares registered in the name of this same Sidro, a com-
pany the principal interest in which is owned by another Belgian registered
and incorporated company—Sofina ¥. Since this last category, which it
will be convenient to designate as the Sidro-(Sofina) interest, comprised
not far short of two-thirds of the entire issued share capital of the Barce-
lona Company, and about five-eighths of the shares allegedly in Belgian
hands,—then, on the basis of the principle of the sufficiency of “even a
single shareholder”, the only practical issue becomes that of deciding on
the character and status of the Sidro-(Sofina) holding;—whereas, the
status of the other shares—the bearer shares and the non-Sidro registered

35 Clearly the fact that in practice a government would not normally put forward

damage, would become important only if the Sidro-(Sofina) holding could
be shown to lack the necessary status and character adequate in itself to
sustain a Belgian claim. It is therefore to this question that I shall now
address myself. It has two aspects, first what was and is the true national
character of Sidro-(Sofina)?—and secondly, was this entity at the material
dates the actual shareholder?

than Belgian entities in the sense that they were companies incorporated
under Belgian law, having their registered head offices in Belgium, and
therefore that, according to the most generally received canons ‘, not
disputed by either Party, they were companies invested with Belgian
nationality. The objection advanced—a curious one to receive Spanish
sponsorship—was that although Sidro-(Sofina) were Belgian by in-
corporation, yet if the corporate veil was lifted, it would be found that
the shareholding interest in Sidro-(Sofina) itself was largely non-Belgian.
The relevance of this contention was maintained as existing on two levels,
one of these being that it revealed as being quite unfounded the Belgian
contention that the savings of numerous humble Belgian individuals,
channelled into the Barcelona Company via Sidro-(Sofina), had been
detrimentally affected by the Spanish treatment of the Company,—for,
so it was alleged on the Spanish side, the ultimate interests in Sidro-
(Sofina) were not Belgian, or at least it had not been established that they
were.

45. I do not find it necessary to consider this particular aspect of the
metter since the Belgian contention that the savings of hundreds of
small Belgian shareholders were injuriously affected through their
interest in Sidro-(Sofina) goes largely to the moralities rather than the
legalities of the issue. The essential legal question is different—namely
whether (the Belgian status by incorporation of Sidro-(Sofina) itself,
being established and not contested)—there are nevertheless grounds
upon which it can be maintained that the corporate veil must be lifted in
order to see what is the character of the ultimate interests lying behind
this veil. It would certainly seem that whoever else can adopt such an
attitude it cannot be Spain,—that Spain is indeed precluded from doing
so,—because it is precisely Spain which, in relation to the Barcelona
Traction Company maintains that the Canadian nationality of the Com-
pany, by incorporation, is conclusive, and that its corporate veil cannot be
lifted in order to take account of the non-Canadian shareholding lying
behind it. Yet, paradoxically *,—that is just what Spain has sought to
maintain in relation to Sidro-(Sofina),—but not Barcelona. On what
basis does this attempt proceed?

46. The argument was that it was Belgium which was precluded from
contesting the lifting of the Sidro-(Sofina) veil, since it was precisely
Belgium which maintained, in relation to the Barcelona Company, that
the veil must be lifted in order to reveal the true Belgian interests under-
lying the Company. But at this point it becomes clear that the rival
positions, like two mathematical negatives that make a positive, cancel
each other out and leave the objective question of the legitimacy, and

40 See footnote 14 in part I, supra.
*! This, however, is only one of the many instances of ‘having it both ways” in
this most paradoxical of cases.

48. The second main challenge to the standing of Sidro-(Sofina) as owners
of the greater part of the Barcelona Traction shares, was based on ob-
jections, not as to the Belgian national character of these entities but as
to their character qua Barcelona shareholders. Over certain periods, it was
pointed out, covering dates material to the validity of the Belgian claim, the
Sidro-(Sofina) shares were vested in nomirdees and/or trästees of American
nationality. The fact is admitted. The effect, according to the Spanish
argument, was that Sidro-(Sofina) while retaining the beneficial owner-
ship, or the beneficial interest, ceased to be the legal owners of the shares,
or rather, ceased to be the actual shareholders. Consequently, at the
time when the Belgian claim arose—that is to say at the date when the
alleged injury to the Barcelona Company was inflicted—the shareholders
were not Belgian, but American, and therefore the “bond of nationality”
postulated by the Permanent Court (supra, paragraph 38) as being neces-
sary to found a right to claim, did not exist so far as Belgium was con-
cerned, at least on the basis of this block of shares 42.

49. This Spanish contention is in part related to the “continuity”
question: the transfer of the shares to non-Belgian nominees or trustees
caused a break, covering a material date, in the Belgian ownership or
status. In the next section (B) below certain comments are made on the
continuity requirement for international claims, namely the requirement
that the claim must be “owned” by a national of the claimant State

42 And as regards all the other shares—i.e., the bearer shares and non-Sidro-
(Sofina) registered shares, the Spanish position was that their alleged Belgian
ownership rested on presumptions and had not been proved.



both at the time when the act complained of occurred, and continuously
up to the date when an international claim is put forward and proceedings
are commenced—(and indeed, strictly, according to one view, up to
the date of judgment or award). At this moment I shall only discuss
what, in relation to a claim of the present kind, is the correct effect to
be attributed to the transfer of shares to foreign nominees, or to foreign
trustees, as the case may be. In either case, does it deprive the transferor
of his status as shareholder in relation to the claim, and hence deprive
his government of the right (if right otherwise exists) to make the claim
on his behalf?

50. It should be noted in the first place that from the Belgian stand-
point in the case—which was throughout that the realities must be
looked to rather than the form—the whole question of the nature of
the interest acquired by the American nominees or trustees was irrelevant,
since in any event (and this was common ground between the Parties)
the beneficial ownership of or interest in the shares remained with
Sidro-(Sofina) and, according to the Belgian contention, this was suf-
ficient per se to found a Belgian claim. However, it was also maintained
on the Belgian side that in any event the effect of the transfers was not
to divest Sidro-(Sofina) of the status of shareholder, and it is this aspect
of the matter that I wish to consider here.

*

51. I need not set out the facts concerning the vesting of the Sidro

retaining merely the beneficial interest; especially as the object of the
whole transaction was to put “Securitas” in a position of being legally



entitled to refuse to comply with Sidro-(Sofina’s) own instructions if
they judged that these were given under enemy pressure. Furthermore,
as Judge Jessup points out, no positive evidence (despite several requests
for it) was produced to show that the trust relationship was determined
before the crucial date of 12 February 1948 (when the first step that led
to the eviction of the Barcelona Company from its Spanish interests
was taken),—although it appears that the relationship was duly deter-
mined only two or three months later when (acting on a request from
Sidro) “Securitas” sent the share certificates that had been deposited
with them to the New Jersey firm of nominees henceforth holding for
Sidro-(Sofina). On this basis therefore the shares would, in the absence
of the necessary evidence to the contrary, have to be presumed still
to have been American, not Belgian owned, at the crucial date of 12
February 1948.

56. It seems to me however that, even if one accepts the view (which,
for reasons to be stated later, I do not) that the effect of the “Securitas”
transaction was to deprive Sidro-(Sofina) pro tem of the status of being
a Barcelona shareholder, a radical change came over the situation about,
or shortly after the middle of 1946, when the war in Europe had been
over for somewhat more than a year. Although the trust deeds entered
into with “Securitas” were, as Judge Jessup describes, never produced
during the case, they were preceded in time, or at least in operative
effect, by something that was produced, namely a “custodian” agreement
between Sidro and ‘“Securitas’’ dated 6 September 1939 (the war having
then broken out, but Belgium not yet being involved), which figures as
Appendix 2 to Annex 3 of the Belgian Memorial in the case. It is abso-
lutely clear from the terms of this agreement that its object was merely
to get the securities it covered physically out of harm’s way, and that
it had no effect whatever on Sidro’s status as shareholder. This came
later with the two Trust Deeds,—one also dated 6 September 1939, but
evidently with suspensive effect pending Belgium’s actual involvement
in the war; and the other dated February 1940. Because of its inherent
probability, 1 see no reason to doubt the Belgian affirmation that these
Trust Deeds were not to become operative unless and until the Brussels
area should pass into enemy occupation, for only then would the danger
of enemy pressure to surrender or procure the surrender of the shares
arise. It is also I think unimportant that the modifications effected in the
first Trust Deed by the second have never been revealed. I see no reason
to doubt the Belgian assurance that they were technical in character,
intended to take account of certain contemporary Belgian war legislation,
which again seems to me inherently probable. But it does not really
matter, because for present purposes one is in any case “assuming the
worst”, viz. that between them these two Deeds did transfer the legal
ownership of the shares to “Securitas”, for the duration of the war so
to speak.

their shares without some such guarantee of eventual retrocession. That
there was such a clause, and that it duly operated in the second half of
1946, seems to me indeed, even apart from inherent probabilities, to be
an inference that can reasonably be drawn from the facts given in Judge
Jessup’s paragraph 92. The result was the change in the situation to
which I referred at the beginning of paragraph 56 supra,—namely that
““Securitas’”’——who in a letter of 14 April 1947 to Sidro described them-
selves as having from 31 December 1946 held the shares “in custody
for your account” (not the language of a Trustee)—now reverted to
their original status of being merely custodians, and Sidro-(Sofina)
reverted to being the legal owners and actual shareholders—(that the
shares were still in the name of nominees is immaterial for the reasons
given in paragraphs 52-54 supra). Accordingly, if this view is correct,
the shares were again Belgian owned on the crucial date of 12 February
1948. There would have been a break in the continuity of their status
as such, from 1939-1946, but as this occurred before the earliest possible
crucial date, it would not signify.

58. It has to be admitted that in the absence of the relevant instru-
ments, the foregoing conclusion can only be conjectural. But it is I
believe a reasonable conjecture, warranted by those facts that are known,
and by the probabilities involved. Of course the Trust Deeds would, if
produced, constitute what is known in Common Law parlance as the
“best” evidence, and unless they could be shown to have been lost or
destroyed, it is unlikely that a municipal court would admit secondary
evidence of their contents. International tribunals are not tied by such
firm rules, however, many of which are not appropriate to litigation
between governments. It is by no means in the nature of an inescapable
inference that the reason why the Deeds were not produced was because
they contained material that would have been prejudicial to the Belgian
case. Documents drawn up in contemplation of war, and in the situation
which confronted countries such as Belgium at that time, may well
have contained provisons, or phraseology, which after the lapse of
nearly 30 years—or for other reasons—a government would be reluctant
to make public. In my opinion, weighing the whole matter up, and having
regard to what seems to be a very reasonable presumption as to what



occurred, Belgium should be given the benefit of the doubt.

59. And this brings me to a point which I consider more important
than any yet mentioned on this particular matter. It is not in my opinion
. possible to regard instruments drawn up in emergency circumstances,
‘for the protection of property in contemplation of war, and of a singularly
predatory enemy (I am of course speaking of the nazified Reich, not of
Germany or Germans under any normal circumstances) in the same
light as instruments entered into at other times and in the ordinary way
of business. Certainly an international tribunal should not do so. In
my opinion such transactions in shares as those now in question, what-
ever the effect that would be given to them in municipal courts for internal
or private law purposes, must, on the international plane, be regarded
as creating between the parties a relationship of a special character,
neither divesting the shares of their pre-existing national character,
nor debarring the transferor’s government from sustaining a claim in
respect of them in subsequent international proceedings. Outside of a
mediaeval disputation, if ever there was a case for having regard to the
reality rather than the form, this is surely it.

*

with the national character concerned: in short, the injury to the claimant
State is not, so to speak, “de-inflicted”’ by the fact that the individual
claimant or company ceases to have its nationality, or that the property
involved passes into the hands of a national of another State ‘”;—and the
position becomes even slightly absurd when the continuity rule is inter-
preted as even excluding such claims though they subsequently return to
their nationality of origin after a comparatively short interval, as might
well be the case with, precisely, shares.

62. In his dissenting opinion in the Panevezys case ‘8, Judge van
Eysinga clearly thought that the continuity rule, though a reasonable
stipulation to be inserted by agreement in treaties about claims—(or to be
read into them in consequence of provisions limiting their application to
persons having the nationality of the claimant State at the treaty date)—
was not a rule of customary international law, in which sphere it could
lead to unreasonable results. Thus a rigid application of it, though justified
where necessary to prevent abuses ‘°, should be eschewed where it would
work injustice, and this view has received support in recent writings con-
tending for a more eclectic application of the rule, so as not to “leave a

19th century in the context of the interpretation of treaties setting up claims com-
missions and was a product of the ordinary rule that such treaties must be interpreted
strictly” —i.e., it was not really a rule of customary international law.

st This last point is essentially the same as the one which arose in the Cameroons
case (I.C.J. Reports 1963) under the head of the “objection ratione temporis” which
I felt obliged to uphold de lege lata in my separate Opinion, for the reasons given
in Part V of it (I.C.J. Reports 1963, pp. 127-130). The particular point material in the
present context is dealt with in the first paragraph on p. 129 of the Volume. But I
failed then to take account of the possibility that the matter might be regarded as
covered by the law of State Succession, though this is still uncertain—see end of
paragraph 62 supra.



anything relating to their merits, but because purely technical considera-
tions bring it about that no State is entitled to act 32. This situation is the
less defensible at the present date in that what was always regarded as the
other main justification for the continuity rule (and even sometimes
thought to be its real fons et origa), namely the need to prevent the abuses
that would result if claims could be assigned for value to nationals of
powerful States whose governments would compel acceptance of them by
the defendant State, has largely lost its validity. Even powerful States are
not now in a position to act in this way: indeed, for reasons that need not
be gone into here, they are in these days at a positive disadvantage in such
matters.

64. Nor can it plausibly be contended that, if the continuity rule were
not strictly applied, legal objections would arise because, if the claim were
successful, the damages or compensation would be payable to the claimant
State, although the private party concerned was no longer its national, or
the affected property no longer belonged to one of its nationals;—for on
the basis that the State is asserting its own right in making the claim, it is
always the position, and it is well recognized internationally, that any
compensation due is paid to the claimant State, and belongs to it, for use
at its discretion. This was implicit in the view expressed by the Permanent
Court in the Chorzéw Factory case, when it said that the damage suf-
fered by the individual could “only afford a convenient scale for the
calculation of the reparation due to the State” —(my italics) °°. If there
are any fetters on the State’s discretion as to what it does with the com-
pensation awarded, they are imposed by the domestic law concerned. So
far as international law goes, the claimant State can use this compensation
as it pleases: it can keep it for itself (though this naturally is not normally
done) or it can pay it to the private party who was injured, whether (as it
will usually be the case) he is still its national, or has since become the
national of another State, or to the national owner of the affected pro-
perty, or to a foreign owner who may have bought it, or the claim, off the

proceedings in respect of Barcelona Traction, a Canadian company, is not
technically part of the fourth preliminary objection, which concerns the
exhaustion of local remedies, it is related to it in an important way, as
will be seen; and since it too has a certain preliminary character, it may
properly receive some consideration here.

68. It appears to me probable that, considered at the international
level 3%, the declaration of bankruptcy made in respect of the Barcelona

stances appertaining to the Barcelona Company, is irrelevant or inconclusive for



Company did involve an excess of legitimate, or at least normal, Spanish
jurisdiction—internationally. This view is not of course based on the
non-Spanish nationality of the Company,—still less because of doubts
(though these certainly subsist) as to whether the Company did, in the
proper sense of these notions, carry on business in Spain, or own pro-
perty or have a domicile or seat there °°. It is based on the nature of the
alleged default on which the petition in bankruptcy was based, and
acceded to by the court. The point may be illustrated by reference to
Barcelona’s subsidiary, Ebro °$, which, although equally a Canadian
company, did undoubtedly carry on business in Spain, owning property,
occupying offices, etc., there. Consequently, had it been Ebro that was
bankrupted, and for non-payment of commercial debts arising out of its
local activities, no question of any excess of jurisdiction could have arisen
despite Ebro’s Canadian nationality—for such matters would have been
legitimately of Spanish concern. (It was indeed noticeable that it was
expressly admitted on the Belgian side that the bankrupting of Ebro (had
that occurred) would have been quite proper, jurisdictionally.) But
Barcelona was not bankrupted for anything of that kind, as is clear from
the bankruptcy judgment itself. It was bankrupted exclusively for the
non-payment of the interest on its sterling bonds, issued outside Spain,
and also held outside Spain except in so far as certain private Spanish
parties had recently acquired a few of them, apparently for the express
purpose of bringing the bankruptcy proceedings. Yet in respect of these
same bonds, issued under Canadian law, all the necessary machinery for
the guaranteeing and enforcement of the obligation, through a well-known
Canadian institution, the National Trust, had been set up, and existed
for utilization in Canada, where also, in the last resort, the Company
could have been made the subject of proceedings for the appointment of
a receiver.

55 Barcelona was a holding company, and a holding company is by definition not an
operating company. This has been brought out in several decided cases, but is too
often lost sight of.

which the petitioners automatitally became bound on acquiring the
bonds. They provided that no proceedings to obtain payment should be
taken by any bondholder until after the (Canadian) Trustee had, upon a
request to act, refused or neglected to do so.

70. Inthese circumstances the primary jurisdiction was clearly Canadian,
and the Spanish courts should have declined jurisdiction,—at least in the
first instance and until the remedies available through the Canadian
National Trust had been invoked. It is true that, under present conditions,
international law does not impose hard and fast rules on States delimiting
spheres of national jurisdiction in such matters (and there are of course
others—for instance in the fields of shipping, “anti-trust” legislation,
etc.), but leaves to States a wide discretion in the matter. It does however
(a) postulate the existence of limits—though in any given case it may be
for the tribunal to indicate what these are for the purposes of that case;
and (b) involve for every State an obligation to exercise moderation and
restraint as to the extent of the jurisdiction assumed by its courts in cases
having a foreign element, and to avoid undue encroachment on a juris-
diction more properly appertaining to, or more appropriately exercisable
by, another State.

71. These considerations apply equally, not only to the initial Spanish
assumption of jurisdiction in bankruptcy, but to various later stages of
the bankruptcy proceedings themselves, and in particular (as part of the
process of finally disposing of the Barcelona Company’s Spanish under-
taking) to the purported cancellation of its shares in Ebro (a Canadian
company)—these being at the time under the control of the Canadian
National Trust or of a receiver appointed by the Canadian courts—and
the “replacement” of these by scrip issued in Spain, and subsequently
sold to the new and specially formed Spanish company, Fecsa °’, without
any reference to the competent Canadian authorities or any action to
procure the enforcement of these measures in Canada, so that there (and
everywhere outside Spain) the original scrip remained and remains
perfectly valid. The same observations apply to the purported transfer of
Ebro’s Canadian share register, its Canadian registered offices, and its
very seat itself (also Canadian), to the city of Barcelona,—in disregard of
the fact that these things, which could not physically be transferred with-
out Ebro’s consent or enforcement action in Canada, remained where
they were, and are still there today, not only in actuality but in law,

57 Standing for ‘‘Fuerzas Eléctricas de Cataluña, S.A.”



seeing that Ebro is a Canadian company whose status, seat and location
of share register and registered offices are all governed by Canadian law.
In short what really took place appears to have had the character of a
disguised expropriation of the undertaking.



75. In this connection a clear distinction must be drawn between
proceedings which, if invalid, are so ab initio, and proceedings the com-
plaint as to which concerns their outcome, e.g., that they resulted in a
denial of justice. As regards the latter kind of proceedings, it is evident
that, in principle at least, local remedies must be exhausted. The case is
different, at any rate as regards the substance of the issues involved,
where the alleged vice relates not to the outcome but to the very inception
of the proceedings.

76. In considering what kind and, so to speak, degree of notification is
legally requisite, it is clearly not sufficient, in cases involving a foreign
element, merely to apply domestic law standards, or to rely on, or rest
content with, the fact that the requirements of the local law concerned
were duly complied with,—if such was indeed the case. Internationally,
it is necessary to consider whether-—objectively—in the case of a foreign
company having its seat and management abroad—a “notice” which
takes the form of nothing more than a simple press publication of the
adjudication in bankruptcy, suffices,—particularly if this publication is
local only, and not effected in the country of the company’s management
and seat. There is here a direct connection with the question of excess of
jurisdiction already discussed above; and it is important to remember
(see paragraph 68) that it was not anything to do with the conduct of the
Barcelona Company’s Spanish undertaking that was in question in the
bankruptcy proceedings, or which formed the basis of the bankruptcy
adjudication, but a primarily extra-Spanish matter, the servicing of the
sterling bonds—which was directly the concern of the Company in
Canada, and of the bondholders’ trustee, the Canadian National Trust.
The very fact that, as was expressly recognized in relation to the Com-
- pany’s domicile, by the bankruptcy petition itself, namely that “it {the
Company] does not have [a domicile] in Spain, any more than it has any
specific commercial establishment there”, must logically lead to the
conclusion that, on the international plane, a notification effected in
Canada, or by Canadian means of some kind, was called for. It is dif-
ficult to see how the apparently admitted non-Spanish domicile of the
Company could possibly lead to the conclusion suggested in the bank-
ruptcy petition, and accepted by the judge, that in these circumstances it
would be ° ‘necessary to limit publication to the Official Bulletin of Tar-
ragona”—which the judge extended to the Official Bulletin of the province


79. The pertinence and force of these considerations is of course
greatly increased where, as in the present case, a foreign element is
involved,—where the bankrupt is a foreign entity, with its seat and
management abroad, and where the occasion of the bankruptcy is not the
local commercial activities of that entity, but one affecting its (chiefly
non-local) bondholders. In such circumstances, mere publication in the
local press, and then not in the ordinary newspapers but in journals of a
highly specialized kind, normally little read except by persons having a

58 Under English law—to cite the system I am most familiar with—in the case of
the winding-up of a company on the basis of a petition, not only must the existence
of the petition be advertised (and not merely in the official London Gazette but in one
of the ordinary daily newspapers also) at least seven clear days before the petition is
due to be heard,—but, in addition, notice of it must be served on the company at its
registered head office, equally before the hearing of the petition, at which of course
the company is entitled to be represented (Halsbury’s Laws of England, loc. cit., in
notes 12 and 13 supra, pp. 544-549). In the case of foreign companies, notice must
no less be served, and, if this cannot be effected at an address for service or place of


“It can be asked whether international law recognizes for the
shareholders in a company a separate and independent right or
interest in respect of damage done to the company by a foreign
government; and if so to what extent and in what circumstances
and, in particular, whether those circumstances (if they exist)
would include those of the present case”

aad (ibid, p. 45):

“In short, the question of the jus standi of a government to protect
the interests of shareholders as such, is itself merely a reflection, or
consequence, of the antecedent question of what is the juridical
situation in respect of shareholding interests, as recognized by inter-
national law.”

86. These observations no doubt indicated that there could be share-
holding interests recognized and protected by law, which therefore
amounted to rights, and that there might be circumstances in which an
infringement of the company’s rights would also infringe the separate
rights of the shareholders. But what the Court said in no sense war-
ranted the view that prejudice caused to the shareholders through illicit
damage done to the company, necessarily and of itself gave the former a
basis of claim which their government could legitimately put forward on
the international plane—this being, broadly speaking, the proposition
advanced on behalf of Belgium.
