                         The object and purpose of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,
                      1961 and its application in the present case — The insufficiency of the test that an
                      objection to designation by the receiving State could denude a property from
                      acquiring diplomatic status — The importance of relying upon the provision for
                      mutual consent under Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
                      Relations — Necessity to balance the interests of the receiving and sending States
                      and duly account for functional necessity — The relevance of the crucial preambular
                      tenets of sovereign equality, the promotion of friendly relations, and the
                      maintenance of international peace and security — Once a property is in actual
                      use, for the purposes of the mission, the guarantees of inviolability should apply.

                         1. I regret that I am unable to concur with the conclusion reached by
                      the majority that the building at 42 avenue Foch in Paris has never
                      acquired the status of “premises of the mission”, and consequently that
                      the French Republic (hereinafter “France”) has not breached its obliga-
                      tions under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961 (here-
                      inafter the “Vienna Convention” or the “Convention”). I am of the
                      opinion that the building at 42 avenue Foch in Paris acquired the status
                      of premises of the mission, as of 27 July 2012, and was thereafter entitled
                      to benefit from the régime of inviolability guaranteed under the Vienna
                      Convention. I endeavour to explain my hesitations regarding what
                      appears to be the Court’s conclusion, in paragraph 74 of the Judgment,
                      that an objection by the receiving State, which is timely and neither arbi-
                      trary nor discriminatory, would prevent certain property from acquiring
                      the status of “premises of the mission” within the meaning of Article 1 (i)
                      of the Vienna Convention. This test inexorably leads to the conclusion
                      that a property may never acquire diplomatic status without the consent
                      of the receiving State. Such a test or any implication thereof is not to be
                      found in the travaux préparatoires, the work of the International Law
                      Commission (hereinafter the “ILC”), the text of the Vienna Convention,
                      or its very object and purpose.

                         2. In my view, the Vienna Convention, interpreted pursuant to cus-
                      tomary rules of treaty interpretation, does not yield the conclusion
                      reached in paragraph 118 of the Judgment. I write to offer some insights
                      on how a body of law governing the establishment and maintenance of
                      friendly relations between equal sovereign States should be interpreted
                      with the objective of balancing the interests of the Parties.

                         3. The gravamen of the case is whether the building at 42 avenue Foch
                      in Paris acquired the legal status of premises of the mission, and, as such,
                      was inviolable under the Vienna Convention at the time of France’s
                      actions. I also wish to take the present opportunity to present my opinion
                      with respect to “how and when” a property may be characterized as
                      “premises of the mission” under Article 1 (i) of the Vienna Convention
                      and benefit from the protections provided for in Article 22.

                         4. It is recalled that, while Article 2 of the Vienna Convention provides
                      that the establishment of diplomatic relations takes place by mutual con-
                      sent, the Convention contains no express requirement for the consent of
                      the receiving State for the establishment of “premises of the mission”.
                      Article 3 (1) (e) of the Vienna Convention further provides that “[t]he
                      functions of a diplomatic mission consist . . . in: promoting friendly rela-
                      tions between the sending State and the receiving State”. The foregoing
                      provisions, coupled with the object and purpose of the Vienna Conven-
                      tion, as evident from the preamble and the text of the treaty as a whole,
                      lead to the inference that the Vienna Convention contains no implication
                      that an objection to designation could denude a property from being
                      characterized as mission premises, regardless of whether such objection is
                      timely, non-­arbitrary and non-­discriminatory.

                         5. As I shall discuss in greater detail below, Article 1 (i) of the Vienna
                      Convention should be interpreted to mean that the “premises of the mis-
                      sion” are defined by reference to the sending State’s notification that they
                      are to be used for the purposes of the mission and by their actual use.

                        6. Diplomatic intercourse and immunities have a firm establishment
                      in history and have been at the core of international relations long
                      before the establishment of the United Nations or even the League of
                      Nations.

                           Privileges and Diplomatic Intercourse Prior to the Vienna Convention
                         7. The sanctity of ambassadors was recognized in early practice and
                      writings. In Roman times, respect for the inviolability of priests of Col-
                      lege of Fetiales who conducted diplomatic negotiations was demanded
                      and obtained by the Republic 1. Hugo Grotius, in De jure belli ac pacis,

                      stated that “[t]here are two maxims in the law of nations relating to
                      ambassadors which are generally accepted as established rules: the first is
                      that ambassadors must be received and the second that they must suffer
                      no harm” 2. Oppenheim and Sir Lauterpacht termed the privileges
                      enjoyed by ambassadors as “sacrosanct” 3. To effectuate such privileges,
                      after the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, establishment of permanent diplo-
                      matic missions became the common practice 4. Subsequently, the Con-
                      gress of Vienna in 1815 5 and the Protocol of the Conference of
                      21 November 1818 (Aix-la-­Chapelle) 6 codified certain practices concern-
                      ing diplomatic agents.

                         8. The Institut de droit international issued its Règlement sur les immu­
                      nités diplomatiques in 1895 and a resolution on Les immunités diploma­
                      tiques in 1929. The 1895 Règlement sur les immunités diplomatiques used
                      the term “inviolability” to denote the duty “to protect, by unusually
                      severe penalties, from all offence, injury, or violence on the part of the
                      inhabitants of the country”. “Exterritoriality” was used in the same draft
                      to cover the duty to abstain from measures of law enforcement 7. This led
                      to the conclusion of several bilateral treaties which accorded privileges on
                      the basis of reciprocity 8. The Sixth International American Conference in
                      1928 adopted the Havana Convention regarding Diplomatic Officers,
                      which dealt with diplomatic privileges and immunities 9. In 1932, the Har-
                      vard Research School published a Draft Convention on Diplomatic Priv-
                      ileges and Immunities 10. It is significant that these early practices and
                      instruments did not reference a requirement of consent or objection to the
                      designation of mission premises by the receiving State, and instead they
                      appear to prefer the notion of mutual consent and reciprocal privileges in
                      diplomatic intercourse and privileges. It follows that an objection to des-

                      ignation by the receiving State is not in consonance with a régime which
                      provides for mutual consent and reciprocal privileges.



                         9. In 1952, as a result of the political backdrop of discontent arising
                      from incidents of violations of diplomatic custom by the Soviet Union,
                      Yugoslavia submitted a draft resolution requesting the United Nations
                      General Assembly (hereinafter the “UNGA”) to recommend that the ILC
                      give priority to the codification of diplomatic intercourse and immuni-
                      ties 11. Diplomatic law was among the first 14 topics selected for codifica-
                      tion, and the work of the ILC eventually resulted in the adoption of the
                      Vienna Convention. 12

                           The Basis of the Diplomatic Function and the Theory of Functional
                                       Necessity in the Work of the ILC in 1957
                          10. During the discussions of the ILC in 1957, the view was expressed
                       that it would be useful to incorporate into the Draft Articles the “basis
                       of the diplomatic function” 13. Even though members of the ILC expressed
                       diverging views on the relative merits of the theoretical aspects of
                       the ­diplomatic function 14, the Draft Articles and commentary in 1958
                       incorporated them. According to the “exterritoriality” theory, the
                       “­premises of the mission represent a sort of extension of the territory of
                       the sending State . . . [T]he ‘representative character’ theory . . . bases
                      such privileges and immunities on the idea that the diplomatic mission
                      personifies the sending State”; and the “functional necessity” theory
                      ­justifies privileges and immunities as being necessary to enable the mis-
                       sion to perform its functions 15. The ILC further stated that it was guided
                       by the third theory of functional necessity in solving problems on which
                       practice gave no clear pointers, while also bearing in mind the representa-
                       tive character of the head of the mission and of the mission itself 16.
                       Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, in particular, in his commentary, seemed to
                       lean in favour of the functional theory on the premise that “it was impos-

                         11. Recapitulating the theory of functional necessity, at the
                      United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities,
                      1961, the preamble was based on a proposal which had the merit of stat-
                      ing that the purpose of diplomatic privileges and immunities is “to ensure
                      the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions” 18.
                      In my view, the basis of the diplomatic function, as these theories expli-
                      cate, offers important guidance on the interpretation of the Vienna Con-
                      vention.
                         12. The historical backdrop elucidated above emphasizes that no pre-

                      appears to permit an objection to designation of “premises of the mis-
                      sion”. Rather, the very purpose of the régime of privileges and immuni-
                      ties places at its forefront the efficient performance of the functions of
                      diplomatic missions. Therefore, in my view, the régime for the establish-
                      ment of “premises of the mission” under the Vienna Convention should
                      be interpreted in such a manner that it provides significant leeway to the
                      facilitation of the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic
                      missions. Such facilitation may be hindered if the Convention is read to
                      permit objections to designation.

                                 C. Object and Purpose of the Vienna Convention
                         13. On 18 April 1961, the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic
                      Intercourse and Immunities adopted the Vienna Convention on Diplo-
                      matic Relations, which became effective on 24 April 1964 19. In the Con-
                      vention’s preamble, the signatory parties indicated “that an international
                      convention on diplomatic intercourse, privileges and immunities would
                      contribute to the development of friendly relations among nations, irre-
                      spective of their differing constitutional and social systems”, and “that
                      the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals
                      but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic mis-
                      sions as representing States”.
                         14. The objectives of the Vienna Convention mirror the very ethos of
                      the United Nations. The Convention benefits from an increased empha-
                      sis, at the time of its drafting, on the principles of international co‑opera-
                      tion, equality of States, peaceful coexistence, and the establishment of
                      friendly relations 20. A proposal put forward by Hungary at the Vienna

                      Conference in 1961 for the preamble of the Convention highlighted that,

                      text of its drafting, the Convention also crystalizes the principles of
                      sovereignty, non-­
                      ­                   interference and territorial jurisdiction 22. It thereby
                      presents two thematic considerations that, together, aim to facilitate the
                      efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions 23. In order
                      to emphasize these principles, the second recital of the preamble of the
                      Vienna Convention postulates, “[h]aving in mind the purposes and prin-
                      ciples of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the sovereign
                      equality of States, the maintenance of international peace and security,
                      and the promotion of friendly relations among nations”. I will examine
                      each in turn.
                         15. The principle of sovereign equality, in conformity with Article 5 of
                      the ILC’s Draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States, 1949, is pri-
                      marily understood as assuring States a right to equality in law 24. In pres-
                      ent international law, sovereign equality denotes the exclusion of the
                      notion of the legal superiority of one State over the other, while account-
                      ing for a greater role to be played by the international community in rela-
                      tion to all of its members. All States thus have equal rights and duties and
                      are equal members of the international community regardless of any eco-
                      nomic, social, political or other differences 25.

                        16. The commitment to promote friendly relations was reinforced by
                      the United Nations General Assembly in 1970 when it adopted UNGA
                      resolution 2625 (XXV), titled “Declaration on Principles of International

                           at the San Francisco Conference, 1945.”

                      accordance with the Charter of the United Nations” 26. This resolution is
                      reflective of customary international law and has been relied upon by the
                      Court time and again 27. The text of the resolution highlights the princi-
                      ples of good faith, sovereign equality of States, the duty to co‑operate,
                      non‑intervention and peaceful settlement of international disputes in a
                      manner that international peace and security and justice are not endan-
                      gered. This intention is further evidenced from the travaux préparatoires
                      of the resolution 28.
                         17. In interpreting the object and purpose of the Vienna Convention, I
                      am obliged to give special consideration to the preventive and corrective
                      elements of diplomatic intercourse. The “maintenance of international
                      peace and security”, as the preamble provides, may be achieved through
                      the prevention of conflict and the peaceful settlement of disputes 29. This

                      p. 19, para. 39, where it stated that
                            “the institution of diplomacy, with its concomitant privileges and
                            immunities, has withstood the test of centuries and proved to be an
                            instrument essential for effective co-­operation in the international
                            community, and for enabling States, irrespective of their differing
                            constitutional and social systems, to achieve mutual understanding
                            and to resolve their differences by peaceful means”.
                         18. Apart from the object and purpose described so far, diplomatic
                      intercourse also requires the promotion of a more dynamic co‑operation
                      between States 30. In a field dominated by reciprocal exchanges, the
                      Vienna Convention provides a framework for States to act as equals on a

                      thereby reap the benefits arising out of the exchange of representatives.
                      Mutual benefits facilitate mutual respect for conceptions such as immuni-
                      ties, inviolability and the privileges of diplomats under diplomatic law.
                      These interests and mutual benefits were called for by Member States of
                      the United Nations and are reflected in the Vienna Convention 31.

                         19. The Court, in the settlement of disputes between States concerning
                      the interpretation of diplomatic law, must therefore give due regard to these
                      crucial preambular tenets of sovereign equality, peaceful coexistence,
                      and the development of friendly relations for the purpose of ensuring
                      the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions. Such
                      an approach would create greater coherence in the field of diplomatic
                      privileges and immunities. In my opinion, a reading of the Convention,
                      which permits a unilateral objection to the designation of “premises of
                      the mission”, would impinge upon its foundational principles, thereby
                      disrupting the fine balance enshrined in the object and purpose of the
                      treaty. Furthermore, an objection, whether it is timely and adjudged on
                      the parameter of not being arbitrary, would not further the enabling of
                      friendly relations, and would rather be an impingement on sovereignty.
                      In such circumstances, the result of the discretionary power that the
                      receiving State possesses would not appear capable of being characterized
                      as an exercise of power in good faith, rather, it would further the notion
                      of the legal superiority of one State over the other.



                        D. Mutual Consent under Article 2 of the Vienna Convention


                         20. An issue that lies at the very centre of my opinion is that the Vienna
                      Convention in clear terms provides for the establishment of diplomatic
                      relations between States to take place by mutual consent. When speaking
                      of diplomatic intercourse in general and the establishment of diplomatic
                      relations and missions, Article 2 of the Vienna Convention states that,
                      “[t]he establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and of per-
                      manent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent”.

                         21. The ordinary meaning of Article 2 thus suggests a requirement of
                      mutual consent for the establishment of diplomatic relations. The ILC
                      in 1957 in its commentary to Draft Article 1 (which became Article 2)
                      stated that “[t]he Commission here confirms the general practice of

                      States” 32. Further, in reference to Article 2, the ILC in 1958 elaborated
                      that
                            “[t]here is frequent reference in doctrine to a ‘right of legation’ said
                            to be enjoyed by every sovereign State. The interdependence of
                            nations and the importance of developing friendly relations between
                            them, which is one of the purposes of the United Nations, necessitate
                            the establishment of diplomatic relations between them. However,
                            since no right of legation can be exercised without agreement between
                            the parties, the Commission did not consider that it should mention
                            it in the text of the draft.” 33
                      The ILC further opined that
                            “[t]he most efficient way of maintaining diplomatic relations between
                            two States is for each to establish a permanent diplomatic mission
                            (i.e. an embassy or a legation) in the territory of the other; but there
                            is nothing to prevent two States from agreeing on other methods of
                            conducting their diplomatic relations, for example, through their mis-
                            sions in a third State” 34.

                        22. Apart from this provision for mutual consent, there is nothing in the
                      Vienna Convention which requires the consent of the receiving State for the
                      designation of property as the premises of the mission. A test that permits
                      a unilateral objection to designation of premises of the mission, regardless
                      of whether it is considered reasonable, would not evince the requirement
                      for mutual consent or agreement between the parties, in the establishment
                      of diplomatic relations, that the Convention and ILC assert. It is therefore
                      reasonable to suggest that the inevitable consequence of permitting an
                      objection to designation is that the consent of the receiving State would
                      begin to play an important role in the establishment of “premises of the
                      mission” which is not reflective of the view that the right of legation cannot
                      be exercised without the agreement of both parties.

                         23. Equatorial Guinea’s main contention is that, by the search, seizure
                      and attachment of 42 avenue Foch in Paris, France breached the inviola-
                      bility of Equatorial Guinea’s diplomatic premises. Equatorial Guinea
                      stated that, under the rule on inviolability,

                              “police, process servers, safety inspectors, etc. may not enter the
                              premises without the consent of the head of the mission. The premises
                              of the mission may not be searched or inspected in any way. Writs
                              cannot be served within the premises of the mission but only through
                              diplomatic channels.” 35

                         24. According to Equatorial Guinea, Article 22 of the Vienna Conven-
                      tion entails an absolute obligation not allowing any exceptions 36. Equato-
                      rial Guinea argued that, “[e]ven when it is suspected that the premises
                      of a mission are being used in a manner incompatible with the functions
                      of the mission, the premises are still not subject to intrusion by officials
                      of the receiving State” 37. Equatorial Guinea points to the various
                      instances on which the French authorities entered 42 avenue Foch in
                      Paris without the consent of the head of the mission in order to conduct
                      searches 38.
                         25. Equatorial Guinea submitted that “[a] building which has very
                      recently been acquired by the sending State — when, as in the present
                      case, that State intends it to be used as premises of its diplomatic mis-
                      sion — enjoys inviolability on the same basis as a building effectively used
                      for that purpose” 39. The receiving State’s consent is immaterial to iden-
                      tify the moment when certain premises start to enjoy inviolability 40,
                      which is also argued to be the correct interpretation of Article 1 (i) of the
                      Vienna Convention 41. Equatorial Guinea also states that the Vienna
                      Convention creates a presumption of validity of the sending State’s claims
                      that certain premises have diplomatic status 42, and is of the view that its
                      interpretation emerges from the plain language of the Vienna Conven-
                      tion, its drafting history and widespread State practice 43. According to
                      Equatorial Guinea, there is also a long-­standing practice between itself
                      and France, under which notification of intention to use certain premises
                      as a diplomatic mission suffices for the acquisition by those premises of
                      diplomatic status 44.
                         26. According to Equatorial Guinea, 42 avenue Foch in Paris became
                      its “premises of the mission” on 4 October 2011, when France was noti-
                      fied in the following terms:

                      400 	immunities and criminal proceedings (diss. op. bhandari)

                                 “[T]he Embassy has for a number of years had at its disposal a
                              building located at 42 avenue Foch, Paris (16th arr.), which it uses
                              for the performance of the functions of its diplomatic mission, a fact
                              which it has hitherto not formally notified to your Department. Since
                              the building forms part of the premises of the diplomatic mission,
                              pursuant to Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Rela-
                              tions of 18 April 1961, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to
                              give you official notification so that the French State can ensure the
                              protection of those premises, in accordance with Article 22 of the said
                              Convention.” 45
                         27. Equatorial Guinea also stated that, on that date, Mr. Teodoro
                      Nguema Obiang Mangue did not own 42 avenue Foch in Paris as, on
                      15 September 2011, Equatorial Guinea had become the majority share-
                      holder of the companies which owned the building 46. It also stated that it
                      had decided to relocate the Embassy even before acquiring ownership
                      of the premises 47. Equatorial Guinea concluded that the searches of
                      42 avenue Foch in Paris carried out on 14 to 23 February 2012 and
                      19 July 2012 were unlawful 48 as they breached the inviolability to
                      which Equatorial Guinea’s “premises of the mission” were entitled 49.
                         28. Yet, it was on 27 July 2012 that Equatorial Guinea claimed that
                      its Embassy offices had been “effectively moved” to 42 avenue Foch in
                      Paris and that it was using the building “for the performance of the func-
                      tions of its diplomatic mission” 50. France was notified in the following
                      terms:
                                 “The Embassy of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea presents its
                              compliments to the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs,
                              ­Protocol Department, Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Sub-­
                               division and has the honour to inform it that, as from Friday 27 July
                               2012, the Embassy’s offices are located at 42 avenue Foch, Paris
                               (16th arr.), a building which it is henceforth using for the performance
                               of the functions of its diplomatic mission in France.” 51

                        29. France’s main contention is that, on the dates of the searches of

                      “premises of the mission” within the meaning of the Vienna Convention,

                         45 See MEG, Ann. 33. See also ibid., para. 8.46; REG, para. 1.41; CR 2020/1, p. 43,

                      para. 47 (Kamto). In any event, Equatorial Guinea states that Mr. Obiang, as the owner
                      of 42 avenue Foch in Paris, used to permit the use of the building for diplomatic purposes
                      even in the years before 2011. See REG, para. 1.2.

                      and, as a result, was not inviolable under Article 22 of the Vienna Con-
                      vention. According to France, “[a] building can have the status of diplo-
                      matic premises only if, first, France, as the receiving State, has not
                      expressly objected to its being considered part of the diplomatic mission,
                      and, second, it is actually used for diplomatic purposes” 52.

                         30. France acknowledges that the Vienna Convention does not provide
                      details concerning the procedure for recognizing the inviolability of
                      “premises of the mission” 53. However, France disagrees with Equato-
                      rial Guinea’s argument based on Article 12 of the Vienna Convention 54:
                      France argues that the mere requirement of express consent under Arti-
                      cle 12 cannot mean that such consent is not necessary to establish the
                      diplomatic mission in a capital city 55. France also stated that ownership
                      of 42 avenue Foch in Paris is unrelated to the enjoyment by those prem-
                      ises of inviolability under the Vienna Convention 56, as supported by the
                      language of Articles 1 (i) and 22 57. France further submits that Equato-
                      rial Guinea’s declaratory theory is not supported by State practice 58.

                         31. France argues that a building is the “premises of the mission” if it
                      is actually used as such 59, supporting its argument by reference to the
                      drafting history of the Vienna Convention 60 and to the practice of Ger-
                      many, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom 61. France
                      emphasized that 42 avenue Foch in Paris had not been “assigned to any
                      actual diplomatic activity when it was searched between 28 September
                      2011 and 23 February 2012, nor when the attachment took place on
                      19 July 2012” 62. France also points to Equatorial Guinea’s admission
                      that 42 avenue Foch in Paris acquired diplomatic status on 4 October
                      2011, and that, as a result, the searches which had taken place before that
                      date could not engage the responsibility of France 63. France suggested
                      that 27 July 2012 should be the earliest date from which Equatorial Guin-
                      ea’s “premises of the mission” could be considered to have been effec-

                      tively moved to 42 avenue Foch in Paris 64. Therefore, there was no breach
                      of the inviolability of those premises on the dates on which 42 ­avenue
                      Foch in Paris was attached and thus France did not incur international
                      responsibility.

                         32. The arguments made by Equatorial Guinea and France present
                      interpretations on the application of the régime of inviolability under
                      the Vienna Convention along a broad spectrum that ranges from “inten-
                      tion to use” to “express consent”. In my view, the ordinary meaning of the
                      text of Article 1 (i) in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention,
                      offers a clear test for the designation of “premises of the mission”.



                        33. Article 1 (i) of the Vienna Convention states:

                                “For the purposes of the present Convention, the following expres-
                            sions shall have the meaning hereunder assigned to them:
                            �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                            (i) the ‘premises of the mission’ are the buildings or parts of buildings
                                  and the land ancillary thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for
                                  the purposes of the mission including the residence of the head of
                                  the mission.”
                      Under Article 22 of the Vienna Convention,
                               “1. The premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of
                            the receiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the
                            head of the mission.
                               2. The receiving State is under a special duty to take all appropri-
                            ate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion
                            or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission
                            or impairment of its dignity.
                               3. The premises of the mission, their furnishings and other prop-
                            erty thereon and the means of transport of the mission shall be
                            immune from search, requisition, attachment or execution.”

                         34. The text of Article 22 does not define “premises of the mission”;
                      it however makes implicit reference to the definition under Article 1 (i).
                      Article 22 therefore creates a régime of inviolability for premises
                      which fall within the definition of “premises of the mission” under Arti-
                      cle 1 (i).

                        35. The provisions of the Vienna Convention have to be interpreted
                      pursuant to rules of customary international law on treaty interpretation
                      as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
                      Treaties (hereinafter the “VCLT”) 65. Under Article 31 (1) of the VCLT,
                      “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordi-
                      nary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in
                      the light of its object and purpose”.
                        36. If interpretation under Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or
                      obscure, or leads to manifestly absurd or unreasonable results, “[r]ecourse
                      may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the pre-
                      paratory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion”, in
                      accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT.

                         37. The ordinary meaning of the terms of Articles 1 (i) and 22 do not
                      specify when certain premises become “premises of the mission”, and, as
                      a consequence, begin to benefit from the régime of inviolability. However,
                      Article 1 (i) appears to provide some useful indications. First, pursuant
                      to Article 1 (i) classifying certain premises as “premises of the mission” is
                      independent of ownership, which suggests that the Parties’ arguments
                      relating to the effect of ownership of 42 avenue Foch in Paris are not
                      relevant for the Court to dispose of the present case. In certain instances,
                      a sending State may acquire premises as its diplomatic mission by renting
                      or by other means, and the acquisition of ownership of property may not
                      be a possibility for all States 66. Thus ownership of the premises is irrele-
                      vant in determining the status of the building. Second, Article 1 (i) iden-
                      tifies “premises of the mission” as premises which are “used for the
                      purposes of the mission”. Notably, that provision employs the word
                      “used”, which suggests a criterion of actual use in order to identify the
                      “premises of the mission”; if the Vienna Convention’s drafters had wished
                      to identify the “premises of the mission” by means of a criterion of
                      intended use, they could have employed the expression “intended to be
                      used” in Article 1 (i).


                        38. It is further use of the premises “for the purposes of the mission”
                      that determines their diplomatic status. The phrase “used for the pur-
                      poses of the mission” must be interpreted in the context of the
                      “non‑exhaustive” list of diplomatic functions found under Article 3 (1) of
                      the Vienna Convention. During the work of the ILC it was noted that a
                      definition of diplomatic functions would be “illustrative and [intended to]

                      provide guidance for States on the nature of diplomatic functions at the
                      present day” 67. It follows that practice in relation to what has been
                      regarded as “used for the purposes of the premises of the mission” would
                      become relevant to assess the point at which a premise may be considered
                      a diplomatic mission. Such practice may provide valuable insights on
                      ascertaining the parameters of the term “used for the purposes of the mis-
                      sion” since the preamble of the Vienna Convention affirms that “the rules
                      of customary international law should continue to govern questions not
                      expressly regulated by the provisions” of the Convention.


                        39. The ordinary meaning of Article 1 (i) therefore suggests that the
                      “premises of the mission” should be identified by reference to a criterion
                      of “actual use” and that such use is “for the purposes of the mission”.

                         40. On the question whether an objection to designation is permissible
                      under the Vienna Convention, the ordinary meaning of the terms of Arti-
                      cle 1 (i) do not allude to such a criterion, they also do not clarify whether
                      any other form of consent by the receiving State is necessary for the
                      ­designation of “premises of the mission”. In my view the context of the

                       offer more guidance in this regard.

                         41. The context of Article 1 (i) is helpful in identifying the time
                      within which, under the Vienna Convention, premises acquire diplomatic
                      status.
                         42. Under Article 4 (1), “[t]he sending State must make certain that the
                      agrément of the receiving State has been given for the person it proposes
                      to accredit as head of the mission to that State”; Article 4 (2) adds that
                      “[t]he receiving State is not obliged to give reasons to the sending State
                      for a refusal of agrément”. Moreover, Article 5 (1) provides that the send-
                      ing State must give “due notification to the receiving State[]” if it wishes
                      to accredit a head of mission or assign any member of the diplomatic staff
                      to more than one receiving State. Such accreditation or assignment is sub-
                      ject to the “express objection by any of the receiving States”. The provi-
                      sion for the accreditation of the same person by two or more States as
                      head of mission under Article 6 is also subject to the “express objection”
                      of the receiving State.

                        43. A contextual reading of Article 1 (i) would indicate that there are
                      no similar requirements of express consent or objection by the receiving
                      State to the establishment of “premises of the mission”. It follows that,
                      such a requirement, cannot be considered to exist on the basis of a con-
                      textual reading of Article 1 (i). If the drafters wanted to include an objec-
