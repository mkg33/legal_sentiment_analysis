                       1. I respectfully dissent in respect of the Court’s finding on Colombia’s
                     second and third preliminary objections inasmuch as the Court’s reason-
                     ing departs from its own jurisprudence and is not supported by the evi-
                     dence before it. Beyond the particulars of this case, it is of great concern
                     that in finding that it possesses jurisdiction, the Court’s reasoning under-
                     mines in my opinion broader concepts underlying the peaceful settlement
                     of disputes.

                                          as to the Existence of a Dispute

                                      1. The Requirement that a Dispute Exist
                        5. The Court reaffirms in its Judgment that the existence of a dispute is
                     a precondition to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over this, and indeed
                     any, case. The Court, however, simultaneously also departs from its own
                     jurisprudence on this requirement. That jurisprudence indicates the
                     importance of initiating an assessment of the existence of a “dispute” with
                     identification of both a “claim” and “positive opposition” to that claim
                     by the States party to the Court’s proceedings. Applying the Court’s pre-
                     vious jurisprudence as to the meaning and existence of a dispute, I am
                     unable to see how a “dispute” as to the subject‑matter invoked by Nica-
                     ragua in its Application existed at the requisite date. In these circum-
                     stances, I am unable to agree with the Court’s claim to jurisdiction over
                     the present proceedings.

                        6. The requirement of a dispute between the parties is a general limita-
                     tion to the contentious jurisdiction of the Court. In the Nuclear Tests
                     cases, where partway through the proceedings the basis of the dispute was
                     found to have become moot, the Court stated: “the existence of a dispute
                     is the primary condition for the Court to exercise its judicial function”
                     (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974,
                     pp. 270‑271, para. 55 ; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment,
                     I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 476, para. 58). Mootness involves the situation
                     where a dispute no longer exists. Ripeness asks whether a dispute exists,
                     that is, whether it has come into being. It is this latter situation that is at
                     issue in the second objection.

                        7. In addition to the requirement that a dispute exist as a general limi-
                     tation on the contentious jurisdiction of the Court, this limitation may
                     also arise from the particular instrument asserted to be the basis of the
                     Court’s jurisdiction. Thus, in this case, the Court’s Judgment refers also
                     to Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá, where the parties to the Pact
                     accept the Court’s jurisdiction in respect of “disputes of a juridical
                     nature . . .” (Judgment, paras. 15 and 50). The particular instrument may
                     place additional limitations on the jurisdiction of the Court, but these
                     further requirements are best viewed as additional requirements rather

                     than a change in the meaning of the term “dispute” itself. Such reasoning
                     is implicit in the Mavrommatis case where the Permanent Court of Inter-
                     national Justice (PCIJ) wrote :
                             “Before considering whether the case of the Mavrommatis conces-
                          sions relates to the interpretation of application of the Mandate and
                          whether consequently its nature and subject are such as to bring it
                          within the jurisdiction of the Court as defined in the article quoted
                          above, it is essential to ascertain whether the case fulfils all the other
                          conditions laid down in this clause. Does the matter before the Court
                          constitute a dispute between the Mandatory and another Member of
                          the League of Nations ? Is it a dispute which cannot be settled by
                          negotiation?” (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2,
                          1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 11 ; emphasis in the original.)

                     All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Pre‑
                     liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 84, para. 29
                     (holding that “consistency of usage suggests that there is no reason to
                     depart from the generally understood meaning of ‘dispute’ in the compro-
                     missory clause contained in Article 22 of CERD”).
                        8. The meaning of the term “dispute” is set forth reasonably fully in
                     the Court’s jurisprudence. In its Judgment in 1924 in the Mavrommatis
                     case, the PCIJ held that: “A dispute is a disagreement on a point of law
                     or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.”
                     (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J.,
                     Series A, No. 2, p. 11.) This Court’s later jurisprudence concerning the
                     elements of a dispute adds detail and precision to the view of the PCIJ.
                     The Court in the South West Africa cases held :


                             “[I]t is not sufficient for one party to a contentious case to assert
                          that a dispute exists with the other party. A mere assertion is not
                          sufficient to prove the existence of a dispute any more than a mere
                          denial of the existence of the dispute proves its non‑existence. Nor is
                          it adequate to show that the interests of the two parties to such a case
                          are in conflict.” (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 328 ; emphasis added.)

                     If a mere conflict of interest as suggested in Mavrommatis is not “ade-
                     quate”, the Court refined the intensity element required of the dispute by
                     holding repeatedly that the claim of one State must be “positively
                     opposed” by another (South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa ; Lib­
                     eria v. South Africa), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports

                        9. Publicists examining the Court’s jurisprudence have elaborated
                     upon what in practice it means to require that the claim of one State is
                     “positively opposed” by another. Professor J. G. Merrills writes that: “A
                     dispute may be defined as a specific disagreement concerning a matter of
                     fact, law or policy in which a claim or assertion of one party is met with
                     refusal, counter‑claim or denial by another.” (J. G. Merrills, International
                     Dispute Settlement, 2nd ed., 1993, p. 1 ; emphasis added.) The idea that
                     “positive opposition” entails a rejection or denial by the opposing party
                     is implicit in the meaning of the word “opposed”. Likewise, in a leading
                     Commentary on the Statute of the ICJ, Professor Christian Tomuschat
                     writes that a dispute presupposes opposing views: “the Court has consis-
                     tently proceeded from the assumption that an applicant must advance a
                     legal claim” (Christian Tomuschat, “Article 36”, Andreas Zimmermann,
                     Christian Tomuschat, Karin Oellers‑Frahm and Christian J. Tams (eds.),
                     The Statute of the International Court of Justice. A Commentary, 2nd ed.,
                     2012, p. 642). Thus, the claim of legal violation by one party must be
                     positively opposed by the other party through that party’s rejection or
                     denial of the claim of legal violation.


                       10. In a minority of cases, the applicant’s claim of legal violation was
                     not met with “refusal”, but rather with silence. In such instances, the
                     Court has been practical rather than formalistic and indicated flexibility
                     as to how positive opposition is to be established. In 1927, for example,
                     the PCIJ observed that :

                             “In so far as concerns the word ‘dispute’, [. . .] according to the tenor
                          of Article 60 of the Statute, the manifestation of the existence of the
                          dispute in a specific manner, as for instance by diplomatic negotiations,
                          is not required.” (Interpretation of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (Factory at
                          Chorzów), Judgment No. 11, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 13, p. 10.)
                       11. Similarly, the Court more recently in Georgia v. Russian Federation
                     summarizing its jurisprudence on the requirement stated :
                             “As the Court has recognized (for example, Land and Maritime
                          Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Pre‑
                          liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 315, para. 89),
                          the existence of a dispute may be inferred from the failure of a State
                          to respond to a claim in circumstances where a response is called for.”
                          (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 84,
                          para. 30.)
                       12. The practice of the Court in inferring opposition from “the failure
                     of a State to respond to a claim where a response is called for” reinforces





6 CIJ1092.indb 154                                                                                       15/02/17 08:34

                     79 	   sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. caron)

                     the conclusion that “positive opposition” generally requires a rejection or
                     denial by the other party. If this were not necessary, then the inference
                     made in the several cases of silence would not have been needed. In the
                     Hostages case, for example, the claim of legal violation by the Applicant,
                     the United States, was met with silence from the Respondent, Iran. The
                     Court in evaluating whether a dispute existed did not merely indicate that
                     the two Parties possessed different views or a conflict of interests. Rather,
                     the Court sifted through the statements of the United States so as to jus-
                     tify the necessary inference that Iran, despite its silence, positively opposed
                     the claim of the United States (United States Diplomatic and Consular
                     Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran), Judgment, I.C.J.
                     Reports 1980, p. 25, para. 47).


                        13. The requirement that a dispute exist may thus be met where:
                     (1) there is a claim of legal violation by a State and such a claim is posi-
                     tively opposed, that is, rejected, by another State ; or (2) there is a claim
                     of legal violation by a State where positive opposition may be inferred
                     from the failure of another State to reply to the first State’s claim of legal
                     violation where such a response is called for.


                                2. The Unprecedented Character of the Present Case
                        14. To the best of my knowledge, the way in which the requirement as
                     to the existence of a dispute arises in this case is unprecedented in the
                     Court’s history. In all of the cases cited in the Court’s Judgment and in
                     this opinion, the case involved a situation where the applicant State has
                     stated clearly its claim of legal violation to the respondent State prior to
                     the date of its Application. The issue in those cases was primarily whether
                     the respondent State positively opposed, that is, rejected, the claim of
                     legal violation by the applicant State.
                        15. For example : the claims of Greece, and as a secondary matter its
                     national, were formal and unequivocal in the Mavrommatis case. Simi-
                     larly, in the Hostages case, the claim of legal violation by the United
                     States was abundantly clear through its despatch of a special emissary,
                     the views expressed by its chargé d’affaires in Tehran, and its representa-
                     tions before the United Nations Security Council (ibid., p. 25, para. 47).


                        16. In Georgia v. Russian Federation, the Court was confronted with
                     the question of whether the particular requirement for the existence of a
                     dispute under Article 22 of the 1965 International Convention on the
                     Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (“CERD”) was met
                     (“[A]ny dispute between two or more States parties with respect to the
                     interpretation or application of this Convention”). The issue in that case
                     was not whether Georgia had made a claim of legal violation at all but





6 CIJ1092.indb 156                                                                                     15/02/17 08:34

                     precisely when in a long series of statements or letters it could be said that
                     such a claim was made to the Russian Federation “with respect to the
                     interpretation or application” of CERD. The Court had no difficulty in
                     ultimately finding that statements by the Georgian President in a Press
                     Conference held on 9 August 2008, the statement of the Georgian Repre-
                     sentative to the United Nations Security Council on 10 August 2008, a
                     published statement of the Georgian Foreign Minister on 11 August
                     2008, and a televised interview with the Georgian President on 11 August
                     2008 “expressly referred to alleged ethnic cleansing by Russian Forces”.
                     On that basis, the Court concluded that those actions constituted “claims
                     [that] were made against the Russian Federation” (Application of the
                     International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Dis‑
                     crimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections,
                     Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 120, para. 113).


                        17. In the present proceeding, Colombia’s second preliminary objec-
                     tion does not reach the point of arguing that it did not positively oppose
                     a claim of Nicaragua. Colombia’s second preliminary objection argues a
                     more fundamental point, namely, that Nicaragua never made a claim
                     which Colombia could oppose.
                        18. This difference is significant. However, it is a difference not
                     addressed by the Judgment. It is appropriate for the Court to infer posi-
                     tive opposition to a claim. It is not in my view appropriate to infer the
                     assertion of the claim. First, such an inference eviscerates the requirement
                     that there be a dispute. Second, what does it mean for the requirement
                     that the respondent positively oppose a claim when the claim is not clear,
                     not to mention not explicit ? An inferred claim is not a claim. It is not
                     asking much of the applicant that they have formulated and communi-
                     cated in some fashion a claim. Third, to infer the claim itself leaves both
                     vague and unclear what the dispute is about. I agree that it is for the
                     Court to objectively determine what is in dispute and that it may thus
                     itself add clarity. For such an objective determination to be based upon
                     an assessment of the protests made, letters exchanged and later pleadings
                     is one thing. It is quite another matter for a court, however, to objectively
                     determine the existence of the dispute not from the articulation of a claim
                     by the applicant and response by (including unjustified silence of) the
                     respondent, but rather to infer it from the overall context in which the
                     parties co-exist. Such an attempt at objective determination is, in my
                     opinion, fraught with potential pitfalls for the parties and the Court and
                     could easily shade into an abuse of discretion. The dangers are evident in
                     the Court’s Judgment in this case.


                        19. The Court’s Judgment does not address the unprecedented charac-
                     ter of the present case. The Court reiterates at paragraph 50 of its Judg-
                     ment that it “must be shown that the claim of one party is positively

                     opposed by the other”, citing the South West Africa cases. The Court’s
                     Judgment, however, immediately adds a statement to the above quoted
                     text, that for the circumstances of this case, profoundly changes the appli-
                     cable law and masks the significant departure from its jurisprudence that
                     follows. The Court states that it “does not matter which one of them [i.e.,
                     the parties] advances a claim and which one opposes it”. Whether this
                     statement is correct depends upon the situation presented. It is starkly
                     incorrect for the situation presented in this case.
                        20. The overwhelming majority of contentious cases have involved dis-
                     putes where there has been a significant exchange of diplomatic protests
                     and letters between the parties concerning the subject of the dispute
                     before the Court. Even within those cases where a preliminary objection
                     is raised as to whether a dispute exists, that preliminary objection can
                     nevertheless be assessed against a factual background comprised of such
                     statements and protests. To the extent that the assertion in paragraph 50
                     refers to the situations just described, then I agree that it does not matter
                     in determining whether a dispute came into existence whether it is the
                     party who ultimately is applicant or respondent that initiated the exchange
                     of diplomatic protests and letters. All that matters is that the factual
                     record evidences that one party positively opposed the claim of the other.
                     But — critically — that is far from the situation presented in this case.

                       21. In particular, where one side has not positively opposed the claims
                     of the other but rather remained silent, it is the applicant who bears the
                     onus of demonstrating that that silence should nevertheless be taken as
                     an opposition to those claims. In cases involving such silence, it is always,
                     then, the applicant which will have made the requisite “claim” capable of
                     giving rise to a “dispute”. That is the situation presented by this case.

                        22. Before reviewing the outcome of the assessments by the Court of
                     the existence of the disputes that are the basis of Nicaragua’s claims, I
                     emphasize that Nicaragua does not dispute directly Colombia’s assertion
                     that there was no claim of legal violation as such by Nicaragua, not to
                     mention a formal claim by Nicaragua, prior to Nicaragua filing its Appli-
                     cation. Rather, Nicaragua argues that it is “obvious” that there is a dis-
                     pute. Nicaragua argues in its written statement at paragraph 3.5 that “[i]t
                     is perfectly obvious that Colombia and Nicaragua are in disagreement on
                     various points of law, and have a conflict of legal views and interests”.
                     Nicaragua, however, does not refer to evidence of a claim of legal viola-
                     tion by it in any form. Rather, Nicaragua at paragraph 3.15 of its written
                     statement to the preliminary objections of the Republic of Colombia
                     writes: “one might ask why Colombia considers that the onus was on
                     Nicaragua . . .”. But this is a different way of stating precisely what is
                     unprecedented about this case. The issue in this case is not that presented
                     to the Court by other cases. If this case were like the others, the issue
                     would be whether the Respondent — Colombia — positively opposed or
                     rejected the claim of Nicaragua. This case does not reach that question.





6 CIJ1092.indb 160                                                                                   15/02/17 08:34

                     82 	   sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. caron)

                     The question in this case is whether the Applicant, having been bound by
                     Article 40 (1) of the Statute and Article 38 (2) of the Rules of Court to
                     state the “subject of the dispute” in its Application, ever communicated
                     the related claim of legal violation in any form so that it might be posi-
                     tively opposed by the Respondent, thus establishing the existence of a
                     dispute.


                       23. In light of the above, it is my view that a dispute cannot be taken
                     to have arisen between the Parties unless Nicaragua made a “claim” capa-
                     ble of rejection by Colombia and communicated it to Colombia in some
                     way. That is, Nicaragua must have — prior to filing its Application —
                     asserted against Colombia its views on those points of law or fact forming
                     the subject of the claims now before the Court.



                                              3. What the Court Holds
                        24. The Judgment of the Court begins correctly by asking what are the
                     disputes that Nicaragua asserts are the subject of the proceeding ; recog-
                     nizing that it is for the Court to objectively assess and specifically articu-
                     late the subject‑matter of the dispute. Looking to the Application and
                     Memorial of Nicaragua, the Court identifies two claims, each of which
                     rests on a distinct dispute. In the Application, the “Subject of the Dis-
                     pute” is described as first, “violations of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and
                     maritime zones declared by the Court’s Judgment of 19 November 2012”
                     and second, “the threat of the use of force by Colombia in order to imple-
                     ment these violations” (Application of Nicaragua, p. 2, para. 2). The sub-
                     missions in the Memorial of Nicaragua confirm that these two claims are
                     the subject of this proceeding. Having identified two claims, the Judgment
                     of the Court proceeds to assess whether a dispute existed with respect to
                     either or both of them at the time of the Application.

                        25. As to whether a dispute existed as to the sovereign rights and mar-
                     itime zones of Nicaragua, the Court at paragraphs 69 to 74 concludes
                     that a dispute as to Nicaragua’s rights in the relevant maritime zones
                     existed at the time of the Application. In reaching this conclusion, the
                     Court’s Judgment refers to two specific items of evidence. What is strik-
                     ing and deserving of emphasis at this point is the contrast with Georgia v.

                        61. Article II of the Pact of Bogotá provides in part that “in the event
                      that a controversy arises between two or more signatory States which, in
                      the opinion of the parties, cannot be settled by direct negotiations through
                      the usual diplomatic channels, the parties bind themselves to use the pro-
                     cedures established in the present Treaty . . .”. The Court in its Judgment
                     proceeds from the basis of its 1988 holding that the reference to direct
                     negotiation in Article II of the Pact “constitutes . . . a condition precedent
                     to recourse to the pacific procedures of the Pact in all cases” (Border and
                     Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and
                     Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 94, para. 62). In so pro-
                     ceeding, the Court in paragraph 95 holds that the test for determining
                     whether settlement is not possible is “whether the evidence provided dem-
                     onstrates that, at the date of Nicaragua’s filing of the Application, neither
                     of the Parties could plausibly maintain that the dispute between them
                     could be settled by direct negotiations through the usual diplomatic
                     ­channels” (Judgment, para. 95).

                        62. The Court finds that “[n]o evidence submitted to the Court indi-
                     cates that, on the date of Nicaragua’s filing of the Application, the Parties
                     had contemplated, or were in a position, to hold negotiations to settle the
                     dispute concerning the alleged violations by Colombia of Nicaragua’s
                     rights in the maritime zones” and on that basis rejects Colombia’s third
                     preliminary objection (ibid., paras. 100‑101).

                       63. I agree with the Court that an obligation to negotiate is satisfied if
                     there is no prospect of settlement. The PCIJ in Mavrommatis articulated
                     such an exception to the negotiations requirement present in that case as
                     follows :
                             “Negotiations do not of necessity always presuppose a more or less
                          lengthy series of notes and despatches ; it may suffice that a discussion
                          should have been commenced, and this discussion may have been very
                          short ; this will be the case if a dead lock is reached, or if finally a
                          point is reached at which one of the Parties definitely declares himself
                          unable, or refuses, to give way, and there can therefore be no doubt
                          that the dispute cannot be settled by diplomatic negotiation.” (Mavrom‑
                          matis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A,
                          No. 2, p. 13.)
                        64. The Court’s conclusion in paragraph 100, however, that “[n]o evi-
                     dence” indicates that “the Parties had contemplated, or were in a posi-
                     tion, to hold negotiations to the settle the dispute” (Judgment, para. 100)
                     is not only not supported by the evidence, it is contradicted by the evi-
                     dence.
                        65. The Court at the outset of its reasoning observes that “through





6 CIJ1092.indb 188                                                                                    15/02/17 08:34

                     96 	   sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. caron)

                     various communications between the Heads of State of the two countries
                     since the delivery of the 2012 Judgment, each Party had indicated that it
                     was open to dialogue to address some issues raised by Colombia as a
                     result of the Judgment” (Judgment, para. 97). This statement is a correct
                     reflection of the evidence.
                        66. The Court also observes that
                             “[t]he issues that the Parties identified for possible dialogue include
                          [1] fishing activities of the inhabitants of San Andrés, Providencia and
                          Santa Catalina in waters that have been recognized as appertaining
                          to Nicaragua by the Court, [2] the protection of the Seaflower Bio-
                          sphere Marine Reserve, and [3] the fight against drug trafficking in
                          the Caribbean Sea” (ibid.).
                     This statement is also a correct reflection of the evidence.
                        67. As an initial matter therefore, the Court’s statement that there is
                     “[n]o evidence” to indicate that the Parties contemplated negotiation is
                     inconsistent with the record.
                        68. The Court’s holding, however, is more subtly worded, focusing as
                     it does on there being no evidence that the Parties contemplated negotia-
                     tions “to settle the dispute” (ibid., para. 100 ; emphasis added).

                        69. Examined more closely, the Court’s reasoning relies upon its view
                     that, although the Parties expressed a willingness to discuss substantive
                     issues, they had each imposed certain preconditions to any such negotia-
                     tions that were so diametrically opposed that the Parties did not contem-
                     plate, or were not in a position to negotiate, a settlement. The Court
                     constructs these preconditions in paragraph 98 of the Judgment.
                        70. Regarding Nicaragua’s asserted preconditions, the Court in para-
                     graph 98 appears to refer to its own characterization of what it has held
                     to be Nicaragua’s dispute. The Court writes “for Nicaragua, such nego-
                     tiations had to be restricted to the modalities or mechanisms for the
                     implementation of the [2012] Judgment”. It does not rely on any state-
                     ment of Nicaragua. Indeed, it offers no citation to any piece of evidence.
                        71. Regarding Colombia’s asserted preconditions, the Court in para-
                     graph 98 states that Colombia did not “define” the subject‑matter of the
                     negotiations in the same way. In doing so, it quotes the interview with the
                     Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs María A. Holguín on 15 Septem-
                     ber 2013 that is reproduced in full at paragraph 56 above. The Court at
                     paragraph 98 uses the Minister’s statement that Colombia is open to a
                     dialogue with Nicaragua to “sign a treaty that establishes the boundaries”
                     to make its point that while the two nations may have been open to dia-
                     logue they held quite different views about the content of such dialogue
                     that made the prospects for settlement extremely unlikely.
                        72. The Court’s juxtaposition of negotiating objectives is unfounded
                     both in the record and in law.
                     — First, the Court repeatedly, and with good reason, in the Judgment
                         elsewhere refers to the importance of examining substance and not





6 CIJ1092.indb 190                                                                                     15/02/17 08:34

                     97 	      sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. caron)

                          form. Yet in this holding its reasoning rests on formalities of negotia-
                          tion rather than their substance. As described above, the Parties
                          repeatedly indicated they were open to discuss many areas of sub-
                          stance with fishing rights being a particularly significant one. Settle-
                          ment of any of the substantive areas may have resolved matters.
                          Settlement of any of the substantive areas certainly would have nar-
                          rowed matters. Preconditions (if there were any) themselves may be
                          simply a part of a negotiating stance and for this reason need to be
                          appraised carefully.

                     — Second, perhaps a juxtaposition of negotiating preconditions could
                       indicate that the chances of a negotiated settlement were remote if
                       there were clear statements indicating that a party was open to dia-
                       logue only if the particular issue of concern was resolved first. But that
                       is not the case here. There are no such statements in the record by
                       Colombia (or Nicaragua) in the relevant months leading up to the fil-
                       ing of the Application of Nicaragua.

                     — Third, and most strikingly, the record directly contradicts the Court’s
                       holding. It is true that the Colombian Foreign Minister’s statement
                       did “define” in some sense an aim of the negotiations from Colom-
                       bia’s perspective. But it did not do so in a way different from that of
                       Nicaragua and certainly did not do so in the way the Court suggests.
                       The Court quotes this statement to support the idea that Colombia
                       sought a treaty that would re‑establish the boundaries it had prior to
                       the 2012 Judgment. It is that assertion which would be incompatible
                       with the Court’s unsupported construction of Nicaragua’s negotiating
                       position in the same paragraph. But that assertion also is flatly con-
                       tradicted by the record. The Foreign Minister’s statement clearly does
                       not seek to re‑establish the boundaries that existed before the Judg-
                       ment but rather to establish the boundaries of the Judgment through
                       an implementing treaty that will satisfy the internal legal requirements
                       of Colombian constitutional law. She states :

                           aragua over those waters —, but that the country ‘is facing a legal
                           obstacle’ to apply it.

                           establishes the boundaries and a legal regime that contributes to the

                        73. Having reaffirmed the obligation to pursue negotiations under
                     Article II of the Pact of Bogotá, the Court finds contrary to the state-
                     ments of the Parties that there was no prospect of settlement. I dissent.
                     This conclusion is not supported by the evidence, and is more broadly of
                     concern, for the Court in so doing undermines the centrality of a duty to
                     negotiate both as a part of the peaceful settlement of disputes and spe-
                     cifically as a part of the scheme set out by the Pact of Bogotá. It is impor-
                     tant to recall the insights of the PCIJ in this respect :

                            “The Court realizes to the full the importance of the rule laying
                          down that only disputes which cannot be settled by negotiation should
                          be brought before it. It recognizes, in fact, that before a dispute can
                          be made the subject of an action at law, its subject-­matter should have
                          been clearly defined by means of diplomatic negotiations.” (Mavrom‑
                          matis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A,
                          No. 2, p. 15.)

                        74. The Court in objectively determining the subject‑matter of the dis-
                     putes before it can be called upon to make fine distinctions. In the present
                     case, it has distinguished very finely between a claim for non‑compliance
                     with a judgment of the Court and a claim for violation of the rights
                     granted by such judgment. This dissent makes clear that the Court is not
                     nearly as adept at distinguishing whether a certain piece of evidence bears
                     on non‑compliance with the 2012 Judgment or on a violation of sovereign
                     rights and maritime spaces defined in the 2012 Judgment. The ease with
                     which these two claims overlap and the difficulty the Court has in assess-
                     ing the evidence will likely complicate the Court’s task at the merits phase
                     of this case.
