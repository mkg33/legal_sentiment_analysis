Having very great respect for the Court, it is for me a matter of pro-
found regret to find it necessary to record the fact that I consider the
Judgment which the Court has just rendered by the casting vote of the
President in the South West Africa case, completely unfounded in law
In my opinion, the Court is not legally justified in stopping at the thres-
hold of the case, avoiding a decision on the fundamental question
whether the policy and practice of apartheid in the mandated territory
of South West Africa is compatible with the discharge of the “sacred
trust” confided to the Republic of South Africa as Mandatory.

Since it is my finding that the Court has jurisdiction, that the Appli-
cants, Ethiopia and Liberia, have standing to press their claims in this
Court and to recover judgment, I consider it my judicial duty to examine
the legal issues in this case which has been before the Court for six years
and on the preliminary phases of which the Court passed judgment in
1962. This full examination is the more necessary because I dissent not
only from the legal reasoning and factual interpretations in the Court’s
Judgment but also from its entire disposition of the case. In regard to
the nature and value of dissenting opinions, I am in complete agreement
with the views of a great judge, a former member of this Court—the
late Sir Hersch Lauterpacht—who so often and so brilliantly contributed
to the cause of international law and justice his own concurring or
dissenting opinions; I refer to section 23 of his book, The Development

The Court’s Judgment rests, as it must, on an interpretation of histori-
cal facts involved in the origin and in the operation of the mandates
system of the League of Nations, in the setting of their period. Since my
own study of the historical record, both of the time of the Paris Peace
Conference and subsequently through the years up to 1939, leads me to
believe that the Judgment misconceives the nature of the peace settlements
at the close of World War I, the nature and functioning of the League of
Nations, and the nature and functioning of the mandates system, I must
expound my conclusions on these matters.

The Court’s Judgment says that it “must decline to give effect” to
the claims of the Applicants; this conclusion naturally rests on the
Court’s analysis of what those claims are. Since I interpret differently
the nature of Applicants’ claims and submissions, I must show wherein
my interpretation differs, having regard to their character and context.
Only when those matters are properly understood, is it possible for me
to reach a judicial conclusion whether Applicants have the legal right
or interest to entitle them to receive from the Court what they request,
or any part of what they request.

The Judgment bases itself on a reason not advanced in the final
submissions of the Respondent—namely on Applicants’ lack of “any
legal right or interest appertaining to them in the subject-matter of the
present claims”. This is said to be a question of the “merits” of the
claim and it is therefore in connection with the “merits” that the nature
of the requisite legal right or interest must be analysed.

The Judgment states that the—

‘““... same instruments are relevant to the existence and character
of the Respondent’s obligations concerning the Mandate as are
also relevant to the existence and character of the Applicants’
legal right or interest in that regard. Certain humanitarian principles
alleged to affect the character of the Mandatory’s obligations in
respect of the inhabitants of the mandated territory were also
pleaded as a foundation for the right of the Applicants to claim in their
own individual capacities the performance of those same obligations.
The implications of Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Mandate ..

require to be considered not only in connection with paragraph 9
and certain aspects of paragraph 2 of the Applicants’ final sub-
missions, but also, as will be seen in due course, in connection
with that of the Applicants’ standing relative to the merits of the
case. The question of the position following upon the dissolution of



the League of Nations in 1946 has the same kind of double aspect,
and so do other matters.”

This is the fifth time the Court has given consideration to legal matters
arising out of the administration by the Republic of South Africa of
the mandated territory of South West Africa. In the course of three
Advisory Opinions rendered in 1950, 1955 and 1956, and in its Judgment
of 21 December 1962, the Court never deviated from its conclusion
that the Mandate survived the dissolution of the League of Nations
and that South West Africa is still a territory subject to the Mandate.
By its judgment of today, the Court in effect decides that Applicants
have no standing to ask the Court even for a declaration that the territory
is still subject to the Mandate.


(1) that the Mandate for South West Africa is a “treaty or convention
in force” within the meaning of Article 37 of the Statute of the Court;

(2) that despite the dissolution of the League, Ethiopia and Liberia had
locus standi under Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate, to invoke
the jurisdiction of the Court;

(3) that the dispute between the Applicants and the Respondent was a
“dispute” as envisaged in Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate; and



(4) that the prolonged exchanges of differing views in the General
Assembly of the United Nations constituted a “negotiation” within
the meaning of Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate and revealed
that the dispute was one which could not be settled by negotiation
within the meaning of that same provision of the Mandate.

Under Article 60 of the Statute of the Court, this Judgment of 1962
is “final and without appeal”. Under Article 94, paragraph 1, of the
Charter of the United Nations, both parties to the case were under
a duty to comply with this decision of the Court.

The Court now in effect sweeps away this record of 16 years and,
on a theory not advanced by the Respondent in its final submissions of
5 November 1965, decides that the claim must be rejected on the ground
that the Applicants have no legal right or interest.

The Applicants have not asked for an award of damages or for any
other material amend for their own individual benefit. They have in
effect, and in part, asked for a declaratory judgment interpreting certain
provisions of the Mandate for South West Africa. The Court having
decided in 1962 that they had standing (locus standi) to bring the
action, they are now entitled to a declaratory judgment without any
further showing of interest.

Paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the Mandate gave a member of the League
the right to submit to the Court a dispute relating to the interpretation
of the provisions of the Mandate if the dispute cannot be settled by
negotiation. As I shall show in more detail later, the Court in 1962
decided that the Applicants qualify in the category “Member of the
League”; this is res judicata and the Court’s Judgment of today does
not purport to reverse that finding. The Court in 1962 equally held
that the present case involves a dispute which cannot be settled by
negotiation; this double finding has the same weight and today’s decision
does not purport to reverse that finding. I do not understand that it
is denied that the dispute refers to the interpretation of provisions of
the Mandate. I do not see how this clear picture can be clouded by
describing the claims as demands for the performance or enforcement
of obligations owed by the Respondent to the Applicants. The submis-
sions may indeed involve that element also, as will be noted, but this
element does not exclude the concurrent requests for interpretation of
the Mandate.

Whether any further right, title or interest is requisite to support
Applicants’ requests in this case for orders by the Court directing
Respondent to desist from certain conduct alleged to be violative of
its legal obligations as Mandatory, may well be a separate question,
but the Judgment of the Court denies them even the declaratory judg-
ment. It may however be said that if the Court, properly seised, finds
and declares that Respondent is violating its legal obligations in the
administration of the Mandate, there is no reason in the Court’s Statute
or in general juridical principles, which would prevent it from ordering
the Respondent to desist. But the Permanent Court and this Court
have not usually framed their judgments in this fashion. Under the
Statute of this Court, as already noted, the Court’s judgment “is final
and without appeal”. By Article 94 of the Charter, “each Member of
the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the
International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party”. If the
Court in its judgment holds that a certain line of conduct is in violation
of a State’s legal obligations, that State is under a duty to comply with



the decision by desisting from the illegal conduct. The Court should

neither can nor should contemplate such a contingency.” (S.S. Wimble-
don, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. I (1923), p. 32.)

The Judgment of the Court today does not constitute a final binding
judicial decision on the real merits of the controversy litigated in this
case. In effect reversing its Judgment of 21 December 1962, it rejects the
Applicants’ claims in limine and precludes itself from passing on the
real merits. The Court therefore has not decided, as Respondent sub-
mitted, “that the whole Mandate for South West Africa lapsed on the
dissolution of the League of Nations and that Respondent is, in conse-
quence thereof, no longer subject to any legal obligations thereunder”.

SECTION II. THE FINALITY OF THE COURT'S PREVIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Judgment of 1962

1 do not think it would be adequate to rest on the finalities of the 1962
Judgment of this Court. But I shall briefly indicate the legal principles
which dictate attributing more authority to the prior decisions and
opinions of this Court than the Court’s present decision seems to reveal.

To dispel the fallacy that no decision on a preliminary objection can
have finality, and as a preliminary matter of clarifying terminology, one
may note that Article 94 (1) of the United Nations Charter uses the
word “decision” in English and “décision” in French. In Article 94 (2)
the terms are “judgment” and ‘‘arrêt” !. In Article 63 (2) of the Court’s
Statute one finds “judgment” rendered in French as “sentence” and in
Article 41 (2) of the Statute, “decision” is “arrêt” in French. In the
Rules of Court, No. 64 (6) speaks of a “decision .. . in the form of a
judgment” (la Cour statue sur la requête par un arrêt). The same expres-
sions in both languages are found in Article 81 of the Rules. In Rule 62 (5),


“1. Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision
of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party.

2. If any party to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it
under a judgment rendered by the Court, the other party may have recourse to the
Security Council, which may, if it deems necessary, make recommendations or
decide upon measures to be taken to give effect to the judgment.”

dealing with preliminary objections, the English text speaks of a ““deci-
sion” and the French text again uses “statue”. The “decision” (to use the
term in Article 26 (5) of the Rules), of 21 December 1962 is labelled a
“judgment” and recites at the outset (p. 321) that the Court “delivers the
following Judgment” (“arrêt”). This use of the term “judgment” (“arrêt”)
is found in every ruling of the Court on a preliminary objection, be-
ginning with the Corfu Channel case (I.C.J. Reports 1947-1948, p. 15)
down through Barcelona Traction (I.C.J. Reports 1964, p. 6). After
analysing passages in the Asylum case, Rosenne writes (The Law and
Practice of the International Court, 1965, Vol. IL, p. 627):

“This, it is submitted, leads to the conclusion that the word
‘decision’ (décision) appearing in Article 59 of the Statute is identical
in meaning with the word ‘judgment’ (arrêt) appearing in Article 60,
and refers not merely to the operative clause (dispositif) of the
judgment, but to its reasons as well. This is clearly the case as
regards the meaning of the word ‘judgment’ (sentence) appearing in
Article 63.”

the terms can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, after 21 December
1962, some obligation with respect to the judgment of that date must have
rested upon Applicants and Respondent under Article 94 (1) of the
Charter. I shall consider below with what either Party was now obliged
“to comply” (à se conformer). Under Article 60 of the Statute, the
Judgment of 21 December 1962 was “final and without appeal” although
(under Article 59) it “‘has no binding force except between the parties and
in respect of that particular case”. Within the meaning of Article 59, the
present proceedings are in “that particular case”. The words in Article 60
“without appeal” clearly refer only to the parties; if they are dissatisfied
with the judgment, they may seek a revision under Article 61 of the
Statute if they are able to satisfy the conditions stated in that Article.
The word in Article 60, “final”, may have a broader significance and may
address itself to the Court as well as to the parties. Since Respondent has
not proceeded in accordance with Article 78 ff. of the Rules of Court, and
has not avowedly sought a “revision” of the 1962 Judgment I do not
consider that there is before the Court a case under Article 61 of the
Statute, despite Respondent’s arguments about “new facts” (with which
I shall deal later).

The statement in Article 60 of the Statute that “the judgment is final
and without appeal”, taken in conjunction with the reference in Article
59 to “that particular case”, constitutes a practical adoption in the
Statute of the rule of res judicata, a rule, or principle, cited in the proceed-



ings of the Commission of Jurists which drafted the Statute of the

“a general principle of law recognized by civilized nations”. It rests upon
the maxim interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium, or in an alternate form,
interest rei publicae res judicatas non rescindi. Judge Anzilotti, in what has
been called “the classic enunciation of the law” (Rosenne, op. cit., p. 624)
listed as the essentials for the application of the res judicata principle,
identity of parties, identity of cause and identity of object in the subsequent
proceedings—“persona, petitum, causa petendi”. (Interpretation of Judg-
ments Nos. 7 and 8 (Factory at Chorzôw), Judgment No. 11, 1927, P.C.IJ.,
Series A, No. 13, pp. 23-27.) These essentials are found in the matter
before us. This leads again to the conclusion that something must have


But the rule in Article 60 of the Statute “cannot ... be considered
as excluding the tribunal from itself revising a judgment in special
circumstances when new facts of decisive importance have been dis-
covered ...”. (Effect of Awards of Compensation Made by the United
Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1954,
p. 47 at p. 55.) Moreover, the Court is always free, sua sponte, to examine
into its own jurisdiction.

Various pronouncements in the jurisprudence of the two Courts, in
various separate opinions and in the “teachings of the most highly
qualified publicists” do not provide an automatic test to determine
what is within and what is without the res judicata rule. I agree with
Anzilotti in the opinion already cited (at p. 24):

“When I say that only the terms of a judgment (le dispositif de
l’arrêt) are binding, I do not mean that only what is actually
written in the operative part (dispositif) constitutes the Court’s
decision. On the contrary, it is certain that it is almost always
necessary to refer to the statement of reasons to understand clearly
the operative part and above all to ascertain the causa petendi.”

The Court itself in the same case clearly held (at p. 20) that the
“findings” on which was based the “conclusion, which has now indis-
putably acquired the force of res judicata” — “findings” which “constitute
a condition essential to the Court’s decision”—were among the points
“possessing binding force in accordance with the terms of Article 59 of
the Statute 1.

the Court, by that judgment, decided that the attitude of the Polish Government
in regard to the Oberschlesische was not in conformity with the provisions of the
Geneva Convention. This conclusion, which has now indisputably acquired the
force of res judicata, was based, amongst other things, firstly, on the finding by the
Court that, from the standpoint of international law, the German Government

that, from the standpoint of municipal law, the Oberschlesische had validly acquired
the right of ownership to the factory—and these findings constitute a condition
essential to the Court’s decision. The finding that, in municipal law, the factory did
belong to the Oberschlesische is consequently included amongst the points decided



The Permanent Court in another case indicated that reasons which
do not go beyond the scope of the operative part (dispositif) are binding.
(Polish Postal Service in Danzig, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 11, p. 29.) But
it is clear that not every reason or argument given by the Court in
support of the decision is part of the res judicata.

Paragraph 3 of Article 62 of the Rules of Court provides: “Upon
receipt by the Registrar of a preliminary objection filed by a party,
the proceedings on the merits shall be suspended ...” On the basis
of this provision it is argued that if the Court in delivering judgment
on a preliminary objection—whether to jurisdiction or to admissibility—
touches on any matter which pertains or appertains to the merits, what
it says is just obiter dicta. This argument is based on a misconception
of the Rule, as its history reveals. It was in the revision of the Rules
by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1936 that there was
inserted the provision that “proceedings on the merits shall be suspended”.
Before that, the Rules contained no such provision. The discussion

on the problem of the time-limits which the Court would already have
fixed for the main proceedings. It was noted that extensions would
probably have to be granted if the Court overruled the preliminary
objection. Thus Judge Fromageot proposed inserting in paragraph 3 the

shall be suspended”. (P.C.LJ., Series D, Third Addendum to No. 2, p. 706.)
When it was suggested by another member of the Court “that the
proceedings on the merits were suspended as from the submission of the
objection”, Judge Fromageot revised his phrasing to read: “From that
moment, the time-limits originally fixed for the proceedings on the
merits shall be suspended.” Thereafter “The Registrar pointed out that
there was not, strictly speaking, a suspension of the time-limits. What
was suspended was the obligation of the parties to file a particular written
Memorial by a given date.” (Ibid., p. 707; italics added.) Judge Fromageot
then at once proposed the phrasing ultimately adopted: “The proceedings
on the merits shall be suspended.”

It is perfectly clear that the provision of the Rule in question was
purely a matter of administrative procedure having to do with the
setting of time-limits and was not conceived to have the substantive
implications now sought to be attributed to it. The Court’s Judgment

is now pressed too far and the historical origin of the Rule must be recalled.

by the Court in Judgment No. 7, and possessing binding force in accordance with
the terms of Article 59 of the Statute. The very context in which the passage in ques-
tion occurs is calculated to establish the right of ownership of the Oberschlesische
from the standpoint of municipal law.

The Court’s Judgment No. 7 is in the nature of a declaratory judgment, the in-
tention of which is to ensure recognition of a situation at law, once and for all and
with binding force as between the Parties; so that the legal position thus established
cannot again be called in question in so far as the legal effects ensuing therefrom
are concerned.” (P.C.LJ., Series A, No. 13, op. cit, p. 20.) (Italics added.)



In proceedings on preliminary objections, the situation of the parties
is reversed. The Respondent, who advances the preliminary objection,
is called on first by the Court to state his case; the Applicant then res-
ponds, the Respondent replies and the oral proceedings close with the oral
rejoinder of the Applicant. On the merits, it is the Applicant who begins
and it is the Respondent who has the last word. That is why it is said:

“Preliminary objection proceedings ... now take the form of
a self-contained case (in which the objecting State appears as
applicant: In excipiendo reus fit actor) incidental to the proceedings
on the merits . ..”” (Rosenne, loc. cit, Vol. I, p. 464.)

The principle is a familiar one: Ballantine’s Law Dictionary (1930),
page 1138—“Reus excipiendo fit actor. The defendant by his plea may
make himself a plaintiff”. The Cyclopedic Law Dictionary, 3rd ed. (1940),
page 975— “The defendant, by a plea, becomes plaintiff’. Bell’s South
African Legal Dictionary, 3rd ed. (1951), page 21—“. .. he who avails
himself of an exception is considered a plaintiff; for in respect of his
exception, a defendant is a plaintiff”.

The Judgment of the Court in this preliminary phase is pronounced,
not on the claims of the Applicant, but on the submissions of the
Respondent.

In this case, in the stage of the preliminary objections, the Respondent’s
Agent on 11 October 1962 first read these submissions:

“the Mandate for South West Africa [has never been, or, at any
rate, is, since the dissolution of the League of Nations] is no longer
a ‘treaty or convention in force’ within the meaning of Article 37
of the Statute of the Court, this submission being advanced—

(a) with respect to the said Mandate as a whole, including Art-
icle 7 thereof, and
(b) in any event, with respect to Article 7 itself 1.”

These submissions required the Court to render judgment on this
point of law in one or the other alternative forms. The Court did render
judgment, finding that the Mandate, despite the dissolution of the
League, was a “treaty or convention in force” within the meaning
of Article 37 of the Statute, and that the validity of Article 7 was not
affected by that dissolution. (See South West Africa cases, I.C.J. Reports
1962, pp. 330 ff.)

These first submissions of Respondent were a direct challenge to the
jurisdiction of the Court by their impeachment of the validity of the
treaty clause (Article 7) by which Respondent had consented to the
jurisdiction of the Court.

! The bracketed words were inserted in a revised submission of 22 October,
as a result of a question posed to the Parties by Judge Sir Percy Spender. Cf. the




I am at a loss to understand how the Court can say that the Court’s
disposal of these first submissions in its 1962 Judgment was merely
basing itself upon an hypothesis or some sort of provisional basis. No
such thought is expressed in the Court’s 1962 Judgment.

The second submission denied the locus standi of Applicants:

“Secondly, neither the Government of Ethiopia nor the Govern-
ment of Liberia is ‘another Member of the League of Nations’,
as required for locus standi by Article 7 of the Mandate for South
West Africa.”

objection (p. 342). This is a clear decision that Applicants have locus
standi and the point is res judicata.

The third submission argued that there was no “dispute” in the sense
of Article 7 because no material interests of the Applicants were involved:

“Thirdly, the conflict or disagreement alleged by the Governments
of Ethiopia and Liberia to exist between them and the Government
of the Republic of South Africa, is by reason of its nature and
content not a ‘dispute’ as envisaged in Article 7 of the Mandate

of the Governments of Ethiopia and/or Liberia or of their nationals
are involved therein or affected thereby.”

The Court (p. 344) expressly decided that the objection must be dismissed
because there was a dispute within the meaning of Article 7. This
decision that the dispute could concern “the well-being and development
of the inhabitants” and need not include material interests of the Appli-
cants, is res judicata.

and through organs of the United Nations were not the kind of negotia-
tions contemplated in Article 7:

“Fourthly, the alleged conflict or disagreement is as regards
its state of development not a ‘dispute’ which ‘cannot be settled by

South West Africa.”

The Court decided (p. 346) that there having been full collective nego-
tiation by one of the “established modes of international negotiation”,
this fourth objection must also be dismissed. The decision that this
type of negotiation satisfies the requirements of Article 7 is also res
judicata.

are to be considered as objections to the jurisdiction. As explained in
the 1962 Judgment and as emphasized in the dissenting opinion of Judge
Morelli, they include objections to the admissibility of the claim. The
distinction is well established in the jurisprudence of the Court.

1962 are final under the provisions of Article 60 of the Statute and
Article 94 (1) of the Charter. It is argued, however, that there is nothing
with which a party can “comply” in decisions of this character. If
Article 60 and Article 94 (1) were indeed to be interpreted as applying
only to judgments calling for some affirmative step, the Articles would be


In Corfu Channel (I.C.J. Reports 1949, at p. 35), the Court decided
“that the action of the British Navy constituted a violation of Albanian
sovereignty”. This was a final judgment or decision and Article 94 (1)
applies to it although no action in implementation was required.

In United States Nationals in Moroèco (I.C.J. Reports 1952, at p. 213)
the Court decided that American nationals were not exempt from certain
taxes. This was a final decision and required no action in implementation
except acquiescence which is similarly required for judgments upholding
jurisdiction.

The decision of the Court in Northern Cameroons was final (I.C.J.
Reports 1963, p. 38) but required no implementation except acquiescence.
In any case, indeed, when preliminary objections are sustained (as in
Norwegian Loans (I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 27)) no implementation by
the parties is required. But there is no basis for saying that Article 94 (1)
excludes all of these cases.

It should also be noted that by Article 61 (3) of the Statute, com-
pliance may be required by the Court before a revision is considered
even though this duty to comply may later be terminated if the judgment
is revised.

The Respondent’s duty of compliance under Article 94 (1) of the
Charter with respect to the judgment of 21 December 1962, was a duty
to acquiesce in the findings of the Court and to conduct itself ac-
cordingly. By pleading to the merits, Respondent recognized and ful-
filled its duty. When the Court decides that it has jurisdiction, a State

to the merits and maintained that a subsequent adverse judgment on
the merits was invalid, would violate its obligation under Article 94.
It may be arguable that Respondent’s first submission “that the whole
Mandate for South West Africa lapsed on the dissolution of the League
of Nations”, was inconsistent with the Judgment of 21 December 1962,

justifiable.

The Advisory Opinions on South West Africa

There has also been much discussion of the three Advisory Opinions


given by the Court in regard to South West Africa. The Court invoked
them in 1962 and Respondent devoted considerable attention to them.
Although an Advisory Opinion or a series of such opinions, is not or
are not legally binding on a State Member of the United Nations, whether
or not the opinion is accepted and endorsed by the General Assembly,
I share the view stated by Judge John Bassett Moore and recalled with
approval by Judge Winiarski in his dissenting opinion in Peace Treaties
(1.C.J. Reports 1950, pp. 89 and 91):

“If the opinions are treated as mere utterances and freely dis-
carded, they will inevitably bring the Court into disrepute: . .. the
Court must, in view of its high mission, attribute to them great
legal value and a moral authority.”

So Judge Azevedo in the same case said that although an ordinary
advisory opinion did not produce the effects of res judicata, “that fact
is not sufficient to deprive an advisory opinion of all the moral con-
sequences which are inherent in the dignity of the organ delivering the
opinion, or even of its legal consequences” (p. 80).

On the basic point that the dissolution of the League did not terminate
the Mandate or Article 7 thereof as a provision of a convention in force,
the Court was unanimous in 1950 and no judge expressed a contrary
view in the giving of the Advisory Opinions of 1955 and 1956. The
Court having expressly reaffirmed this finding in 1962 (at p. 334), it
would indeed have been brought “into disrepute” if it should now have
attributed no weight to those prior views.

“It may be stated that the practical difference between the binding
force of a judgment, which derives from specific provisions of the
Charter and Statute apart from the auctoritas of the Court, and the
authoritative nature of an advisory opinion possessed of that same


“In using judicial decisions as a ‘source of law’ by virtue of Ar-
ticle 38 (1) (d) of the Statute, no distinction at all is made between
judicial decisions given in the form of a judgment, and judicial decis-
ions given in the form of an advisory opinion. Recourse is equally
had to both types of judicial pronouncement.” (Ibid., p. 745, note 1.)

Judge de Visscher, while stating clearly that advisory opinions do
not involve the doctrine of chose jugée, adds: “Dans le plan de leur
autorité doctrinale, il n’y a guère de distinction à faire entre arrêts et
avis.” (Aspects récents du droit procédural de la Cour internationale de
Justice, 1966, p. 195.)

As already noted, the Court’s present judgment does not decide
that the Mandate or Article 7 thereof has lapsed and the authority of




SECTION III. RESPONDENT’S ALLEGATIONS OF “NEw Facts”

Respondent laid great stress on what were alleged to be certain “new
facts” which, it was argued, were so important that had they been known
to the Court in 1950, the Court would have reached conclusions dif-
ferent from those actually pronounced in the Advisory Opinion which
it gave in that year. Waiving the question whether this argument, as
advanced, evaded the provisions of the Statute and of the Rules of Court
concerning the revision of a prior decision, the so-called “new facts”
may be examined, since, if they were “new facts of decisive importance”,
the Court would certainly need to take them into account even if this
required some modification of conclusions previously reached. Some

cannot be ignored in this opinion. My examination does not lead me
to believe any revision of the statement in the Court’s Judgment of 1962
(p. 334) is called for: “All important facts were stated or referred to in
the proceedings before the Court in 1950.” The re-examination of some
of these facts reinforces previous conclusions.

Mutatis mutandis, the situation and conclusion are the same as those
stated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Monastery
of St. Naoum case with reference to proposed revision of a decision of
the Conference of Ambassadors:

“This decision has also been criticised on the ground that it
was based on erroneous information or adopted without regard
to certain essential facts . . .

whether, over and above the group of circumstances which led to
that decision, there exist new facts or facts unknown at the time
when the decision was taken; in other words, whether, as alleged
by the Serb-Croat-Slovene State and Greece, the Conference of
Ambassadors allocated the Monastery to Albania simply because

in existence, which, if taken into consideration, would have led to
a contrary decision.

As concerns new facts, there are none in the present case. It is
true that . . . the Conference was unacquainted with the documents

revision . . . But in the opinion of the Court fresh documents do
not in themselves amount to fresh facts. No new fact—properly
so-called—has been alleged.

As regards facts not known... [i]t is... difficult to believe that

with these documents, which are in no sense secret.” (P.C.IJ.,
Series B, No. 9, pp. 21-22.)

The “new facts” are listed as four in number in the Respondent’s


Preliminary Objections at pages 345-346. In C.R. 65/7, 30 March 1965,
at pages 44 and 45, and C.R. 65/16, 12 April 1965, at pages 43 ff., the
first of the four “new facts” is omitted *.

The first “new fact” as listed in the Preliminary Objections is the so-
called express reservations made by the South African representative,
Mr. Smit, at San Francisco on 11 May 1945. In the Court’s 1950 volume
of Pleadings, etc., at page 114, the United States in its statement set
forth the entire text of the declaration by Mr. Smit except for the extra
paragraph which Respondent says is not in the official transcript but
which, before his death, Mr. Smit said was part of his statement. It is
doubtful whether this extra paragraph adds much to what is said in the
last three paragraphs of what is printed in the United States statement.
The United States statement adds a reference to United Nations, Official
Records; General Assembly, First Session, Second Part, Fourth Committee,
Part I (1946), 200, Annex 13. Doc. A/123 in this annex is a letter dated
17 October 1946 from the Legation of the Union of South Africa to

stration of South West Africa which begins: “1. On 7 May 1945, the
delegation for the Union of South Africa informed the United Nations
Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, as follows:
...” Here follows the statement as set out in the Preliminary Objections
(at pp. 237-238) but the extra paragraph is not included.

According to the verbatim transcript of the meeting at which the
South African delegate made his statement, Running Number 33, the
delegate at the end of the prepared statement said: “That is all I have
to say.” There is no indication that the extra paragraph was pronounced,
and one is therefore led to conclude that Mr. Smit’s memory may have
been faulty 2.

presentative of South Africa had subsequently referred to Mr. Smit’s
declaration as a “reservation”. It was said that he had circulated copies
of the statement on 7 May before reading it to the meeting. The statement
continues by referring to a speech by the South African representative
about this “reservation” at the second session of the General Assembly,

105th Plenary, p. 635). The United States statement also said (p. 116):

“The effect of the ‘reservation’ was simply to give notice that
the Union of South Africa would later raise in a competent forum
the question of the future of South West Africa, with a view to

record (1.C.J. Pleadings).

was perhaps too facile.



This so-called South African reservation was also discussed by Judge

above, Respondent abandoned this “new fact”.

The second “new fact” is the rejection by the Preparatory Commission
of the United Nations of a proposal for a temporary trusteeship com-
mittee. This event cannot be called “new” since it was discussed at

1950 Pleadings before this Court at pages 161 ff. He gave explanations
why the proposal was rejected but the matter was argued at such length
in the present phase of the case that it is well to state the facts.

The Respondent seemed to attach importance to this alleged “new

termination or dissolution of the League of Nations and that the United
Nations refused to accept any responsibilities or authority in connection
with the territories which had been administered as mandates. Respon-
dent was presumably stimulated by the 1962 joint dissent, pages 536-
537, to make this argument.

By decision of the San Francisco Conference, a Preparatory Com-
mission met in London on 24 November 1945. It made a report which
was considered in the First Part of the First Session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations, which also met in London, beginning
on 10 January 1946. One of the matters considered was the establish-

trusteeship system. The account of what happened and the reasons
why it happened are to be found in the official records and in authoritative
contemporary reports.

The situation in the Preparatory Commission is summarized in the

Foreign Affairs to the Parliament in London:

“Article 85 of the Charter... requires that the Trusteeship
Council shall advise the General Assembly on the terms of trustee-
ship proposed for non-strategic areas. On the other hand Article 86,

down that one-half of the members of the Council are to be the
States administering trust territories, and this presupposes that
the terms of trusteeship for such territories have already been ap-
proved. To resolve this dilemma the Executive Committee recom-
mended the creation, under Article 22 of the Charter, of a tempo-
rary Trusteeship Committee . .. Certain Delegations opposed this
solution on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, but it never-
theless secured the necessary two-thirds majority in the Executive
Committee. The Preparatory Commission, however, was unable

Assembly is devoted almost entirely to the question of the action
to be taken by individual Member States to prepare terms of trustee-
ship. With regard to the question of United Nations machinery
the effect of the draft resolution is merely to defer any solution

Misc. No. 5, 1946, p. 8.)

The same analysis of the situation is presented in the report of the
United States Delegation to the President of the United States:

pendent upon prior negotiation of trusteeship agreements and
was therefore likely to be delayed for some time, the United States
concurred in a suggestion that a temporary trusteeship committee
of the Assembly might be instituted pending establishment of the
Council. Some others believed, on the contrary, that such a com-

and might not even be constitutional. The United States, while
questioning the validity of the latter point, agreed that a temporary
committee was not essential and that the early conclusion of the
necessary trusteeship agreements to enable the Trusteeship Council
to be established should be encouraged. This view was finally


The thrust of Respondent’s argument about the non-inclusion of
the proposal for a temporary trusteeship committee is that this omission
proved that it was agreed that the United Nations had no responsibility
in regard to mandated territories. As indicated in the two foregoing

non-inclusion was due to arguments based upon the unconstitutionality
of the proposal and on the argument that the establishment of a tem-
porary committee might delay instead of expediting the conclusion of
trusteeship agreements. Since this point is important, it may be noted
that the Yearbook of the United Nations 1946-1947, at page 36, gives the

porary trusteeship committee.

The point of view of the United States delegation is further revealed
in an amendment which it proposed in the Preparatory Commission
on 4 December 1945 (Doc. PC/TC/11):

“1. The Report by the Executive Committee makes no provision
for any organ of the United Nations to carry out the functions of
the Permanent Mandates Commission. In Part III, Chapter IX,
dealing with the League of Nations there occurs the following state-
ment: ‘Since the questions arising from the winding up of the Man-
dates system are dealt with in Part III, Chapter IV, no recommen-
dation on this subject is included here.’ (Section 3, paragraph 5,
page 110.) No specific reference to the functions of the Permanent
Mandates Commission is to be found, however, in Part III, Chap-



ter IV, relating to the trusteeship system. Section 2, paragraph 4,
of that Chapter (page 56) merely assigns to the Temporary Trustee-
ship Committee a general advisory function in this field: “(iv)
advise the General Assembly on any matters that might arise with
regard to the transfer to the United Nations of any functions and
responsibilities hitherto exercised under the Mandates system.”

2. In order to provide a degree of continuity between the man-
dates system and the trusteeship system, to permit the mandatory
powers to discharge their obligations, and to further the transfer
of mandated territories to trusteeship, the Temporary Trusteeship
Committee (or such a committee as is established to perform
its functions) and, later, the Trusteeship Council should be speci-

powers are now obligated to make to the Permanent Mandates
Commission. The existing obligations and rights of the parties
involved under the mandates system with respect to any mandated
territory continue in force until such territory is placed under trustee-
ship by an individual trusteeship agreement or until some other

which might exist between the termination of the mandates system
and the establishment of the trusteeship system, it would appear
appropriate that the supervisory functions of the Permanent Man-
dates Commission should be carried on temporarily by the organ
of the United Nations which is to handle trusteeship matters.

3. In order, therefore, that the report of the Preparatory Com-
mission may be complete in this respect the following amendment
is proposed.

4. Amendment

Add a new subparagraph (v) to paragraph 4 of Part III, Chap-
ter. IV [Trusteeship System], Section 2, to be worded as follows:

‘(v) undertake, following the dissolution of the League of
Nations and of the Permanent Mandates Commission, to receive

respect to such territories under mandates as have not been
placed under the trusteeship system by means of trusteeship
agreements, and until such time as the Trusteeship Council
is established, whereupon the Council will perform a similar
function’.” (Italics added.)

At this stage of the debates in the Preparatory Commission, the
representative of Yugoslavia introduced a substitute proposal for the
appointment of an ad hoc committee of the General Assembly which
would have functions like those which it had been proposed the Tempo-
rary Trusteeship Committee should discharge. The representative of the




of the Preparatory Commission on 8 December 1945. The text of this
speech was circulated. (Doc. PC/TC/30.) The speech includes the fol-


“My Delegation still feels that there is nothing objectionable
whatever in the Report of the Executive Committee proposing
the establishment of a Temporary Trusteeship Committee; it still
seems to us that that is a perfectly constitutional method of procedure

to agree to that proposal if we cannot agree on any alternative;
but we are quite willing to explore any other alternative arrange-
ment and are quite willing, as I indicated, to accept the proposals
of the Yugoslav Delegation on the lines which I have indicated.”

again objected on the same grounds as before, namely that the proposed
ad hoc committee of the General Assembly would be just as unconsti-
tutional and would involve the same delays as would the suggested
Temporary Trusteeship Committee. In view of this situation, the Chinese
representative, Mr. Wellington Koo, proposed that the matter be re-

which made no mention of a temporary or ad hoc committee. This report
was adopted by 28 votes to none. (Doc. PC/TC/32; see also Vernon
McKay, “International Trusteeship—Role of United Nations in the
Colonial World”, XXII, Foreign Policy Reports, No. 5, 15 May 1946,
p. 54.)

It thus appears that the reason why the Preparatory Commission did
not recommend—as had its Executive Committee—the establishment of
any temporary body to deal with the mandates prior to the creation of
the United Nations Trusteeship Council, was the impossibility of reaching
an agreement between the point of view staunchly supported by the

and strongly opposed by the delegation of the Soviet Union and other
delegations on the other hand. It must be borne in mind that this was
the first meeting of a representative United Nations body after the
Charter entered into force and there was evident reluctance to force an
issue over important opposition.

However, the ensuing debates in the Fourth Committee of the General
Assembly at the First Part of its First Session in London, revealed that
there was wide agreement on two points: first, that the dissolution of
the League of Nations would not terminate the mandates; and second,
that the United Nations had responsibilities in connection with the

were included within the scope of Chapter XI of the Charter and therefore
favoured setting up machinery to carry out the obligations of the United
Nations under this Chapter. However, at this stage, and later, the
prevailing opinion concentrated on urging the desirability of placing
all mandated territories under the trusteeship system as soon as possible.



Various points of view expressed in the debates in the Fourth Committee
of the General Assembly at this First Session are revealed by the following
extracts !:

[van Asbeck, Netherlands, p. 12]

“The attention of the Committee was then called to the gap
in the administration of the territories under mandate between the
winding up of the League of Nations and their coming under the

Council should have the power to deal with such territories in
the interim period.”

[Mr. Makin, Australia, p. 13]

the consideration of items pertaining to trusteeship arrangements,
and of matters arising under Chapter XI of the Charter. Australia
believed that these two functions should be taken up separately . ..

It should consider also the functions of the United Nations


The importance of Chapter XI was that it was already in effect,
and did not depend upon the establishment of the trusteeship system.
It applied to all territories which were not fully self-governing,
and required no negotiations or decisions.

Mr. Makin then drew the attention of the Committee to the
specific undertaking in paragraph e of Article 73. He urged that
the Committee should advise the General Assembly as to what
arrangements were appropriate for discharging its functions under
Chapter XI of the Charter.

[He said they would introduce a resolution recognizing the
sacred trust.] The machinery should be devised for carrying out
the functions of the United Nations which pertained to the ful-
filment of this obligation.”

explanation about the report which he had submitted:

“The suggestion that the Committee should consider the pro-
cedures for approving trusteeship agreements, including the possi-
bility of providing some interim machinery for this purpose, had

in written form. The sub-committee which had fully discussed the
matter, had agreed that it should be left completely open for the
General Assembly to decide later.” (P. 37.)

The representative of the United Kingdom objected to the omission—

1 Counsel for Applicants attached undue weight (19 March 1965, C.R. 65/3,
p. 30 and subsequently) to the statement by Mr. Nicholls of South Africa. I do not
reproduce this or certain other statements already spread on the record of the case.

*, .. of any reference to the question of the procedure for dealing
with trusteeship matters in the period between this session and the
establishment of the Trusteeship Council . . .

[He read a statement]: “The United Kingdom delegation has,

and this Committee, emphasized the need for such arrangements
if delay in bringing the trusteeship system into operation is to be
avoided . .. the United Kingdom delegation would like to remind
the Committee that when we withdrew our pressure for the inclusion
of something on this point in the draft resolution we did so... on

decision with its eyes open as to the implications ...

There is, unfortunately, some evidence that our efforts to prevent
unavoidable delay, by the creation of machinery for bridging the
gap between sessions, are even now not fully appreciated in all


The Soviet representative stated that his delegation “still maintained
the view that the establishment of temporary trusteeship machinery
would hamper rather than facilitate the coming into operation of the
permanent system” (p. 39).

The representative of the United States suggested an amendment
to a proposal advanced by the British delegation as follows:

“The Committee also considered whether it would be desirable
to follow up the draft resolution prepared by the Preparatory

for an interim body to deal with trusteeship matters between the
first and second parts of the first session of the General Assembly.
The Committee decided to make no recommendation on this
subject.” (P. 40.)

“there was no mention of any interim trusteeship body in the Preparatory
Commission’s Report”, and because the proposal had not been submitted
in written form (p. 40).

The representative of Byelo-Russia also objected because the United

creation of an interim body, but merely had not made any recommen-
dation on this subject”. The difficulty was overcome by the adoption of
a neutral statement submitted by Mr. Ralph Bunche of the United
States. In a later statement Mr. Bunche, who was then Acting Chief of
the Division of Dependent Area Affairs of the United States Department

one of procedure rather than substance”. (XII Dept. of State Bulletin,
1945, pp. 1037, 1043.) If the issue had really been, as contended by
the Respondent in this case, whether the mandates would survive the
dissolution of the League of Nations and whether the United: Nations


had any responsibilities in regard to mandates, the question certainly
would have been one of substance.

The third “new fact” on which Respondent relied, is another matter

to which the joint dissenting opinion called attention occurred at the
meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva in April
1946, in other words, shortly after the First Part of the First Session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations. The events in question
at the meeting of the League Assembly follow in sequence those which

duced a resolution which read as follows:

“The Assembly,

Considering that the Trusteeship Council has not yet been

have not been transferred into territories trusteeship;

Considering that the League’s function of supervising mandated
territories should be transferred to the United Nations, in order to
avoid a period of interregnum in the supervision of the mandatory


Recommends that the mandatory powers as well as those ad-
ministering ex-enemy mandated territories shall continue to submit
annual reports to the United Nations and to submit to inspection
by the same until the Trusteeship Council shall have been con-


This proposal did not gain general support and, precisely as happened
in the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations and in the first
meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations, a neutral text
was finally adopted. This text was as follows:

“The Assembly:

Recalling that Article 22 of the Covenant applies to certain terri-
tories placed under mandate the principle that the well-being and
development of peoples not yet able to stand alone in the strenuous


1. Expresses its satisfaction with the manner in which the organs
of the League have performed the functions entrusted to them
with respect to the mandates system and in particular pays tribute
to the work accomplished by the Mandates Commission;

2. Recalls the role of the League in assisting Iraq to progress
from its status under an ‘A’ Mandate to a condition of complete
independence, welcomes the termination of the mandated status of
Syria, the Lebanon, and Transjordan, which have, since the last
session of the Assembly, become independent members of the




3. Recognises that, on the termination of the League’s existence,
its functions with respect to the mandated territories will come to

declared in Article 22 of the Covenant of the League;

4. Takes note of the expressed intentions of the Members of the
League now administering territories under mandate to continue

peoples concerned in accordance with the obligations contained
in the respective Mandates until other arrangements have been
agreed between the United Nations and the respective mandatory
Powers.”

contrast between these two resolutions to support the argument that the
rejection of the original Chinese resolution proved that the United
Nations did not agree that it had any responsibilities in regard to the
mandatory régime which had functioned under the League of Nations.
However, as anyone familiar with proceedings in the United Nations

that a particular resolution is not adopted or that its sponsor withdraws
it. Many reasons may enter into the unwillingness of delegations to vote
for a particular proposition which may have been introduced as a ballon
d’essai, or for other reasons. In the actual case of the Final Assembly of
the League of Nations, it would not be an unreasonable supposition

the League all mandates would be terminated, that resolution also would
have failed to secure the necessary support.

It is worth noting that the original Chinese resolution suggested the
necessity of avoiding ““a period of interregnum in the supervision of the
