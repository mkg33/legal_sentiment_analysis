   1. I regret not to be able to follow the Court’s majority in the decision
which the Court has just adopted in the present Judgment on preliminary
objections in the case concerning the Application of the International Con-
vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia
v. Russian Federation). My dissenting position encompasses the whole of
the Court’s reasoning, and its conclusions on the second preliminary
objection and on jurisdiction, as well as its treatment of issues of sub-
stance and procedure raised before the Court. This being so, I care to
leave on the records the foundations of my dissenting position, given the
considerable importance that I attach to the issues raised by both Georgia
and the Russian Federation in the cas d’espèce, bearing in mind the settle-
ment of the dispute at issue ineluctably linked to the imperative of the
realization of justice under a United Nations human rights treaty of the
historical importance of the International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter the CERD Conven-
tion).

   2. I thus present with all care the foundations of my entirely dissenting
position on the whole matter dealt with by the Court in the Judgment
which it has just adopted, out of respect for, and zeal in, the exercise of
the international judicial function, guided above all by the ultimate goal
precisely of the realization of justice. To that effect, I shall dwell upon all
the aspects concerning the dispute brought before the Court which forms
the object of the present Judgment of the Court, in the hope of thus con-
tributing to the clarification of the issues raised and to the progressive
development of international law, in particular in the international adju-
dication by this Court of cases on the basis of universal human rights
treaties.

into the consideration of the relationship between the optional clause/
compromissory clauses and the nature and substance of the correspond-
ing treaties wherein they are enshrined.
    4. Attention will thus be drawn to the principle ut res magis valeat
quam pereat, before I turn to the elements for the proper interpretation
and application of the compromissory clause (Art. 22) of the CERD Con-
vention (encompassing its ordinary meaning, its travaux préparatoires,
and the previous pronouncement of the Court itself on it). In considering,
next, the ineluctable relationship between peaceful settlement and the
realization of justice, particularly under human rights treaties, I shall
dwell in particular, upon the question of the verification of prior attempts
or efforts of negotiation, in the light of the relevant case law of the Hague
Court (PCIJ and ICJ).
    5. In sequence, I shall single out the concern of contemporary jus gen-
tium with the sufferings and needs of protection of the population, an
issue which, in my view, assumes a central position in the consideration of
the present case concerning the Application of the International Conven-
tion on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This will
lead me to a review of the evolutive interpretation of human rights
­treaties, such as the CERD Convention, regarded constantly in inter­
 national case law and international legal doctrine as living instruments, so

                     Compulsory Jurisdiction Revisited

                       1. The Work on the PCIJ Statute
                 of the Advisory Committee of Jurists (1920)
   6. In June‑July 1920, the Advisory Committee of Jurists appointed by
the Council of the League of Nations to draft the Statute of the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) discussed at length the possi-
bility of providing the PCIJ with compulsory jurisdiction 1, so as to bring

soon reached consensus on the introduction of a rule whereby the PCIJ
would be competent to hear certain disputes without the need of a previ-
ous (ad hoc or conventional) agreement between the contending parties.

extended over all disputes of a “legal” nature, whereas consent would
have still been required to bring other kinds of matters before the PCIJ.
It was seemingly intended that the introduction of such system of com-
pulsory jurisdiction in disputes of a “legal nature” would also extend to
other cases in so far as they were covered by general or specific conven-
tions between the (contending) parties. The discussion of drafts of a juris-
dictional clause, since the 10th meeting of the Committee, kept in mind
particularly Article 14 of Covenant of the League of Nations, which
expressly referred to disputes “submitted” by the parties to the PCIJ 2.

   8. A proposal was advanced to the effect that the (PCIJ) Statute itself
was to be used as a general instrument whereby States would provide
their consent to jurisdiction ; in a working draft proposed by Baron Des-
camps, a last paragraph was added to the effect that : “Any State sub-

means all disputes [of a legal nature].” 3 Already at the 14th meeting of the
Committee (held on 2 July 1920), compulsory jurisdiction had been gen-
erally accepted 4. Moving on to the applicable law, the Committee then
considered the inclusion of general principles in the list of legal sources
applicable by the PCIJ.

jurisdiction (even without any special convention conferring it upon the
Court) to hear and determine cases of a “legal nature” between member
States of the League of Nations concerning : (a) the interpretation of a

fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international
obligation ; (d) the nature or extent of reparation to be made for the
breach of an international obligation ; (e) the interpretation of a sentence
passed by the Court. This latter was also to take cognizance of all dis-
putes of any kind which may be submitted to it on the basis of a general

   2   Article 14 of the Covenant reads :
         “The Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption

       shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character
       which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion
       upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.”

 or particular convention between the parties. And, in the event of a dis-
 pute as to whether a certain case came within any of the aforementioned
 categories, the matter was to be settled by the decision of the Court 5.
     10. In the substantial debates of the Advisory Committee, of 2 July
1920, one of its members (E. Root), trying to restrain the prevailing
­view, stated that “the world was prepared to accept the compulsory juris-
 diction of a Court which applied the universally recognized rules of
 ­international law” ; however, he did not think that it was disposed to
  accept “the compulsory jurisdiction of a Court which would apply prin-
  ciples, differently understood in different countries” 6. Accordingly, in his
  view, “the beginning must be modest”, with a “relatively limited juris­
  diction” 7. The President of the Advisory Committee (Baron Descamps)
  promptly retorted that Mr. Root’s statement that “principles of justice”
  allegedly varied from country to country
      “might be partly true as to certain rules of secondary importance. But

Mr. Root’s view, arguing that it had incurred into a “confusion” with
“compulsory arbitration”, that “did not come within the competence of
the Committee”, which was “concerned with the rules to be applied by
the Court” (the PCIJ) ; B. C. J. Loder repeated that “all possible confusion
between the question of compulsory arbitration and that of the rules to
be applied by the Court must be avoided” 10.

that :
      “the Committee did not intend to enable a party to avoid the juris-
      diction of the Court by alleging that there was still some hope of
      settlement by diplomatic means.

           The Court, after satisfying itself in limine litis that an attempt has
        been made to settle the case by diplomatic means, (. . .) shall deliver

        that the Court may hear and determine, without any special conven-
        tion, disputes between States which are members of the League of
        Nations if such disputes are of a legal nature (. . .).” 11
  13. The Advisory Committee itself, commenting on this provision of
the draft, noted that :
        “in the opinion of the majority of the Committee, the grant of such
        powers, though perhaps not strictly in accordance with the letter of
        the Covenant, follows its spirit so exactly that it would seem a great

entrusted [by the Council of the League of Nations] with the historical
task of drafting the Statute of the Hague Court in 1920. The Council
itself, however, was to take a different position, opposed to the proposed
compulsory jurisdiction of the PCIJ. The matter was then referred to the
Assembly of the League of Nations.

              2. The Debates of the Assembly of the League of Nations
                          and Subsidiary Organs (1920)
   14. At the I Assembly, in 1920, the question of the compulsory juris-

of the Advisory Committee of Jurists were present therein, in their capaci­
ties of delegates of their countries. By and large, in the Assembly debates
that followed 13, the proposed clause of compulsory jurisdiction of the

        “It would seem to follow that one of the parties could, in the absence of a separate
      and special convention or of special consent, lay the case before the Court, which is
      competent to receive it, and that the Court, being competent, could not only entertain
      the case, but could, at the request of the complaining State, proceed to decide it in the
      absence of the defendant State invited to appear before the Court.”
   13 Extensively reported in the League of Nations’ document : PCIJ, Documents Con­

cerning the Action Taken by the Council of the League of Nations under Article 14 of the



245     convention on racial discrimination (diss. op. cançado trindade)

PCIJ did not meet much enthusiasm on the part of most member States
of the League, although some States endorsed it (cf. infra).
   15. In particular, the originally proposed Article 34, then Article 36 in
the final numbering of the draft Statute of the PCIJ, was doubted to be in

established to study the issue, and to consider whether the Statute could
serve as an instrument whereby States could express their consent to the
PCIJ’s jurisdiction 14. The Sub-Committee acknowledged the controversy
on the interpretation of the Covenant, but decided not to propose any
amendment of the relevant Articles of the draft Statute 15.

   16. The negotiation deadlock was overcome thanks to a proposal by
the Brazilian Delegate 16 (Raul Fernandes), who devised an alternate ver-

to adhere or not 17 ; he then submitted a revised proposal focused on the
possibility that States, which desired to extend the scope of compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court, were permitted to do so by means of a declara-
tion. This proposal setting forth the optional clause was then approved in
the Assembly (8th Meeting), together with the whole draft Statute 18.
   17. The Norwegian Delegate (F. Hagerup), who — like R. Fernandes
— had worked on the topic in the Advisory Committee, though noting
with some regret that the momentum built by the Committee had been lost,
in the debates of the Assembly welcomed the Brazilian amendment ; he

view still in force even without recourse to the optional clause declaration,
at least for “all matters specifically provided for in treaties and conven-
tions in force”, as acknowledged by the amended jurisdictional clause 19.
   18. The main points made during the debates were reported in the
­minutes (procès-verbaux) of the Assembly’s III Committee, in charge of
 the draft Statute of the PCIJ. In the debates of 24 November 1920 on
 compulsory jurisdiction, the delegate of Argentina (H. Pueyrredon) stated
 that if the PCIJ’s “jurisdiction was not obligatory, the Court of Justice
 would (. . .) be merely an arbitration tribunal” 20. The delegate of Brazil
(R. Fernandes) strongly criticized the modifications made by the League’s

held that “[f]or legal questions the Court should have jurisdiction because
the decisions of the Court are the application of law, and make law” 21.

  19. Likewise, the delegate of Panama (H. Arias) thought that “the
compulsory jurisdiction could well be maintained”, and “the parties
should be obliged to bring the case before the Court if they had not
agreed to submit it to arbitration or to enquiry by the Council” 22. In the
same line of thinking, the delegate of Portugal (A. Costa) endorsed the
Advisory Committee’s support of compulsory jurisdiction ; he argued

       “the Covenant imposed recourse to the Court as an obligation, being
       inspired by the principle, contrary to that held by Bismarck, that
       ‘right goes before might’. The League of Nations had undertaken the
       task of preventing war. The only means of effecting this was obliga-
       tory recourse to justice. If a Court with obligatory jurisdiction could
       not be established, the League was dead. (. . .) The League of Nations
       would gain strength by admitting the principle of the adaptation of
       the Covenant to the needs of humanity. Moreover, a Permanent

       great treaties of peace which conferred this jurisdiction upon it in
       special cases ; it would also constitute a mere repetition of the Hague
       Court of Arbitration.” 23
   20. The delegate of South Africa (Lord Robert Cecil), however, intro-
duced doubts into that debate, by arguing that the will or consent of the
parties should prevail (rather than compulsory jurisdiction), as the Court’s
judgments “would not be enforced” if they “concerned vital interests” of
the States 24. The Norwegian delegate (F. Hagerup) sharply disagreed with

Council had not been able to adopt the point of view of the Jurists’
Committee” 25. The delegate of the Netherlands (B. C. J. Loder) also regret-
ted the “misunderstanding between the Jurist’s Committee and the Coun-
cil”, and held that “the establishment of compulsory jurisdiction was
exactly the step forward which should be made, and the step desired by the
Covenant” 26 ; yet, to keep on insisting to take this step further would run
“the risk of bringing about disagreement between different Powers and
thus of failing to achieve any result” at all 27.

cism came this time from the delegate of Belgium (H. Lafontaine), to
whom the principle of compulsory jurisdiction was, by then (in 1920),

       “considered as the only means of emerging from the situation created
       by the war. The resistance to the application of the principle was due

        to the two fetishes of unanimity and sovereignty. (. . .) The only
        admissible sovereignty was that of justice. (. . .) The Covenant bore
        the imprint of the fact that its authors were inspired by the fetishes
        of vital interests and honour, but at least these two expressions were
        not to be found in the Covenant, and this in itself constituted an
        element of progress.” 28
   22. Insisting on his criticism, the delegate of Belgium (H. Lafontaine)
saw “a contradiction in Article 14 of the Covenant, in that it provided for

only if they both agreed to do so” 29. The delegate of the British Empire
(Sir Cecil Hurst), however, did not think that the draftsmen of the Cove-
nant had the intention to establish a Court with compulsory jurisdiction ;
he beheld as the “true solution”, if arbitration did not succeed, “to induce
States to conclude mutual treaties” foreseeing recourse to a Court 30. This
was the way, in his view, to overcome “the hesitation of some States to
accept universal compulsory jurisdiction” 31. H. Lafontaine expressed
some skepticism, in reply to the proposal of Sir Cecil Hurst 32.


   23. In the remaining debates on the matter, of 1 and 13 December 1920,
the delegate of Greece (N. Politis) remarked that, since it seemed “impos-
sible to accept the idea of compulsion”, which “could not be imposed
upon minds which had not spontaneously accepted it”, the solution
appeared to be “to establish a network of separate conventions extending
the jurisdiction of the Court” 33. For his part, the delegate of Switzerland
(Max Huber) suggested the possibility of adoption of a convention for

that :
           “The principle of compulsory arbitration is not only a principle of
