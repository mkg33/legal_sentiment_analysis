As the Court has stated (para. 36), the function of a decision of the Court
on its jurisdiction in a particular case is solely to determine whether or
not it may entertain the case on the merits and not to make any deter-
mination on substantive issues. The Court is obliged to discharge this
function before entering into the merits of a case. Moreover, this function
to decide on its jurisdiction is both primary and imperative. It is at one
and the same time both determined and limited by the Charter of the
United Nations and the Statute of the Court. The Court cannot emanci-
pate itself from this statutory requirement. It is therefore not only in con-
formity with the Statute of the Court but also by the force of logic that
the point of departure for the Court in responding to that question would
have to be the determination of its jurisdiction ratione personae.

It is within this paradigm that the Judgment should be understood: as
a decision by the Court on its jurisdiction, without any position being
taken on the merits of the dispute.
