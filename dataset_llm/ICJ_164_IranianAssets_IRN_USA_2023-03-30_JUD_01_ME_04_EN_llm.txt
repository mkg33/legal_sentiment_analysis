       2. I disagree with the reasoning and the conclusion of the Court on this point. I have therefore
voted against operative paragraph 236 (1) of the Judgment. The reasons of my disagreement are as
follows. First, the analysis of the Court that led it to this conclusion is in contradiction with the criteria
the Court established in its 2019 Judgment on preliminary objections for determining the
characterization of an entity as a “company” under the Treaty. Secondly, the definition of the term
“company” in Article III (1) of the Treaty does not exclude a State-owned or State-controlled entity
such as Bank Markazi in view of its functions, particularly when it engages in commercial activities
in the territory of the host State. Thirdly, an application of the criteria established in the
2019 Judgment shows that the activities Bank Markazi was carrying out at the relevant time in the
territory of the United States were of the nature of those which allow it to be characterized as a
“company” within the meaning of the Treaty.

                                        C. Changing criteria in mid-course

      7. The Court’s need for further information was premised on the quest for a better
understanding of the nature of the activities carried out by Bank Markazi in the territory of the
United States that were affected by the United States’ measures at the relevant time. This focus
flowed from the Court’s conclusion, at the time, that,

        “since it is the nature of the activity actually carried out which determines the
        characterization of the entity engaged in it, the legal person in question should be
        regarded as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty to the extent that it is engaged
        in activities of a commercial nature, even if they do not constitute its principal
        activities” 2.


        8. The Court therefore stated that it must address

        “the question of the nature of the activities engaged in by Bank Markazi. More precisely,
        it must examine Bank Markazi’s activities within the territory of the United States at
        the time of the measures which Iran claims violated Bank Markazi’s alleged rights under
        Articles III, IV and V of the Treaty.” 3

Thus, the criteria developed by the Court in its 2019 Judgment for assessing whether Bank Markazi
was a “company” under the Treaty were centred on the nature of the activities it was carrying out at
the relevant time in the United States.

       9. However, in the present Judgment dealing with the merits phase of the same case, the
majority engages in a volte-face and comes up with a new criterion which gives prominence to the
function of the entity concerned. Thus, it is stated in paragraph 51 of the Judgment that the series of
transactions carried out by Bank Markazi at the relevant time “must be placed in its context, taking
particular account of any links that it may have with the exercise of a sovereign function”, as though
it was possible to imagine that the commercial activities of a central bank could have no link to its
sovereign functions. This is a new test which was not part of the criteria developed by the Court in
its 2019 Judgment. Instead of the nature of the activity carried out being the determining factor for
the characterization of the entity engaged in it, as was stated in paragraph 92 of the 2019 Judgment,
it is now the function of the entity and the link between that function and its activities that are
considered decisive. This new test flies in the face of the reasons for which the Court invoked
Article 79ter (4) of its Rules to join to the merits the third objection of the United States. If the
decisive criterion was the link of the activities to the sovereign function of Bank Markazi, then there
was no reason for the Court to insist that it did not have before it all the facts necessary to determine
whether the activities carried out by Bank Markazi in the United States at the relevant time would
permit its characterization as a “company”.


      10. It is not contested that Bank Markazi’s primary function is a sovereign one, since it is the
Central Bank of Iran. The link that such activities could have with the functions of a central bank
was known to the Court. It has not been discovered as a result of the pleadings of the Parties during
the merits phase of the case. Moreover, the link of a commercial activity with a sovereign function
does not render it a sovereign activity nor does it deprive it of its nature as a commercial activity.
Thus, the new criterion used by the Court neither withstands close scrutiny nor does it assist the
Court in assessing whether an entity may be characterized as a “company”. At any rate, it is legally
erroneous for the Court to apply new criteria, and to move the goal posts in the middle of the case,
when it had so clearly announced, in its Judgment on the preliminary objections, the criteria which
it would use for the determination of whether the activities engaged in by Bank Markazi at the
relevant time in the United States would qualify it as a “company” under the Treaty. A court of law
cannot blow hot and cold in establishing criteria for resolving a legal issue or in applying them to the
object of its determination while adjudicating the same case.

      11. Furthermore, there is a clear difference between sovereign activities “linked to the
sovereign functions of the State”, which were referred to in the Court’s 2019 Judgment, and
commercial activities linked to a sovereign function. The latter link does not transform the
commercial activities into sovereign acts or acts of sovereignty of the State. The ICSID Tribunal in
the Československá Obchodní Banka, A.S. (CSOB) v. The Slovak Republic case had to deal with a
similar issue. The question was whether the State-owned CSOB Bank could be characterized as a
“national” of the contracting State within the meaning of Article 25 of the Washington Convention,
or whether it was to be regarded as the State as such, since it carried out activities linked to sovereign
functions. The Tribunal stated as follows:

             “It cannot be denied that for much of its existence, CSOB acted on behalf of the
      State in facilitating or executing the international banking transactions and foreign
      commercial operations the State wished to support and that the State’s control of CSOB
      required it to do the State’s bidding in that regard. But in determining whether CSOB,
      in discharging these functions, exercised governmental functions, the focus must be on
      the nature of these activities and not their purpose. While it cannot be doubted that in
      performing the above-mentioned activities, CSOB was promoting the governmental

                                                          -4-

        policies or purposes of the State, the activities themselves were essentially commercial
        rather than governmental in nature.” 4


      12. Moreover, as explained in the following section, the new test devised by the Court in the
present Judgment for determining whether Bank Markazi’s activities in the United States at the
relevant time qualify it as a “company” under the Treaty runs counter to the definition of the term
“company” in Article III (1) of the Treaty, and to the treatment to be accorded to government
agencies and instrumentalities under Article XI (4) thereof.

                           D. The definition of the term “company” in Article III
                                           of the Treaty of Amity

       13. Article III (1) of the Treaty defines a company as “corporations, partnerships, companies
and other associations, whether or not with limited liability and whether or not for pecuniary profit”.
As the Court observed in its 2019 Judgment, it is not contested that “Bank Markazi was endowed
with its own legal personality by Article 10, paragraph (c), of Iran’s 1960 Monetary and Banking
Act, as amended” 5. It was also stipulated in the same Act that Bank Markazi “shall be governed by
the laws and regulations pertaining to joint-stock companies in matters not provided for by this Act”,
and “shall not be subject to the general laws . . . relating to ministries, government companies and
agencies”. Moreover, the Court also stated, in the same Judgment, that “the fact that Bank Markazi
is wholly owned by the Iranian State, and that the State exercises a power of direction and close
control over the bank’s activities . . . does not, in itself, exclude that entity from the category of
‘companies’ within the meaning of the Treaty” 6.


       14. Nevertheless, in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty of Amity, which was aimed
at guaranteeing rights and affording protection to natural and legal persons engaging in commercial
activities, the Court was also of the view that having a separate legal personality under the domestic
law of one of the Contracting Parties would not be a sufficient condition “for a given entity to be
characterized as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty of Amity” 7. Thus, in order to benefit
from the protection offered to Iranian companies in the territory of the United States, Bank Markazi
would have to show that its activities in the United States were of a commercial nature. I share fully
this view of the Court as expressed in its 2019 Judgment. This is also the reason that led the Court to
enquire into the nature of the activities that Bank Markazi was carrying out in the territory of the
United States at the time its assets were affected by the United States measures complained of by
Iran before the Court.


       15. The issue in dispute in the present case is not whether Bank Markazi usually and generally
engages in commercial activities in various parts of the world. What is of interest here, as far as the
Treaty of Amity and the dispute between the Parties is concerned, is whether the activities undertaken
by Bank Markazi in the territory of the United States which were the subject of the United States
measures complained of by Iran were commercial activities. This is the crux of the dispute. Thus,
the issue is not about broadly characterizing Bank Markazi as a “company” in all circumstances or

in all its operations, but only with respect to the activities in which it was engaged in the territory of
the United States at the relevant time.


        16. It is important to clarify this for the purposes of the dispute at hand, because what matters
is not that Bank Markazi should always be treated as a “company” in the United States under the
Treaty of Amity, irrespective of the activities in which it is engaged, but that it should be treated as
such if its activities in the United States markets permit its characterization as such. In other words,
it is only when Bank Markazi intervenes in the United States markets in a competitive manner and
enters into business relationships with other entities that it becomes entitled to be treated as a
“company” for the purpose of those activities under the Treaty. It should also be recalled that
Article XI (4) explicitly allows State corporations, government agencies and instrumentalities to
engage in commercial and other business activities within the territory of the other High Contracting
Party but prevents them from claiming immunity from taxation or other liability to which privately
owned enterprises are subjected. This provision also applies to Bank Markazi as a government
agency or instrumentality of Iran, and protects its commercial activities or investments in the
United States.


       17. The fact that Bank Markazi is State-owned or State-controlled, or engages in sovereign
activities in Iran, or has a sovereign function under Iranian law, does not exclude it from carrying out
commercial activities as a “company” in the territory of the United States under the Treaty or from
receiving the treatment owed by the United States, under the Treaty, to Iranian entities which qualify
as a “company” in view of their business activities in the territory of the United States. To the extent
that the activities undertaken by Bank Markazi in the United States are of a commercial or business
nature, such activities would enable Bank Markazi to be characterized as a “company” under the
Treaty and, consequently, to fall under the jurisdiction of the Court for the purposes of the present
dispute. Whether the purpose for which the activities are pursued is for pecuniary profit or not, as
indicated in Article III (1), or is to make money for the State or for the monetary reserves of the State
does not deprive it from being considered a “company” under the terms of the Treaty. Nothing in the
Treaty of Amity indicates that the treatment to be accorded to “companies” which are engaged in
commercial or business activities in the territory of the other party depends on the purpose of the
transactions or the function which the entities involved usually perform in their own country. The
treatment is accorded because of the commercial or business nature of the activities in which they
are engaged and which are entitled to protection under the Treaty. The Court affirmed as much in its
2019 Judgment. In paragraph 92 of that Judgment, the Court stated that,

        “since it is the nature of the activity actually carried out which determines the
        characterization of the entity engaged in it, the legal person in question should be
        regarded as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty to the extent that it is engaged
        in activities of a commercial nature, even if they do not constitute its principal
        activities” 8.

Thus, the reasoning of the Court linking the characterization of the entity as a “company” under the
Treaty to the purpose of the activity or to the function of the entity, instead of the nature of the activity
as previously held by the Court in 2019, finds no basis in the Treaty of Amity.

                       E. The nature of the activities undertaken by Bank Markazi
                                 in the United States at the relevant time

       18. The activities in question, based on the information available to the Court, consist of
22 security entitlements in United States dollars purchased by Bank Markazi during the years 2002
to 2007. They were purchased through Clearstream, a company based in Luxembourg, which acts as
a bank for other banks and specializes in custody and settlement operations. As Clearstream does not
have a bank branch in the United States, it uses cash operating accounts at J. P. Morgan and Citibank,
both in New York, for payments, such as the payment of principal and interest on Clearstream’s
offshore security entitlements 9. Once the security entitlements matured or were sold, the principal
amount would be repaid with the proceeds deposited in a securities account maintained for Bank
Markazi by Clearstream with Citibank and could generate additional interest 10. It is the proceeds of
these security entitlements held by Citibank for Bank Markazi that were blocked and later turned
over to various claimants in the United States following the adjudication, by United States courts, of
the Peterson cases.


       19. The Monetary and Banking Act of Iran mentioned above, in its Article 13, paragraph 4,
permits Bank Markazi, inter alia, “[p]urchasing and selling . . . [g]overnment bonds, and the bonds
issued by foreign governments or accredited international financial institutions” 11. The bonds
purchased by Bank Markazi, worth around US$1.8 billion, were issued in the financial market by
States, public enterprises or the World Bank and were processed through a bank in the United States.
Bank Markazi bought them for profit and, as with any financial investment, it was able to resell some
of the bonds or parts of bonds whenever such transactions enabled it to realize profits instead of
keeping them until maturity. To this end, it had to monitor the inevitable fluctuations in the bond
market. It was therefore involved in investment activities in the financial markets and it received the
proceeds of its investments through Clearstream Bank, which had them deposited in an account with
a United States bank. In 2012, “after the last bond matured, the cash associated with the bonds was
placed on an interest-bearing account maintained at Citibank in New York” 12.


       20. In the Peterson pleadings before the United States District Court, Southern District of
New York, the attorneys for the plaintiffs characterized the above financial transactions by
Bank Markazi as commercial activities in the territory of the United States. According to them, “[i]n
order for Markazi to purchase the Restrained Bonds and receive interest and principal payments
related to those bonds, the Defendant Agent Banks had to undertake substantial commercial activity
in the United States as the agents for, and under the direction of, Markazi” 13. They also argued that,
“once the Banking Agent Defendants implemented Markazi’s bond purchases, various entities acting
as Markazi’s agents had to engage in substantial commercial activity in the United States to enable
Markazi to receive interest and principal payments related to its investments”14. These arguments
were not rejected by the district court. Instead, in its Order of 28 February 2013, the district court
rejected Bank Markazi’s arguments asserting immunity from attachment for its assets since they were
used for central banking purposes on the basis of the FSIA, paragraph 1611 (b) (1). The court rejected
this plea, citing the “notwithstanding clause” of the TRIA and Executive Order 13599, which 
according to the court  “suggest that Bank Markazi is not engaged in activities protected by

1611 (b) (1)” of the FSIA. The district court therefore found that no central bank immunity applied
to the activities of Bank Markazi in the United States, which it considered to be of a commercial
nature.


       21. It is surprising, to say the least, that the Judgment finds the assertions made by counsel for
Bank Markazi in United States court proceedings, and relied on by the United States before the
Court, to “accurately reflect the reality of the bank’s activities”, while totally ignoring the arguments
made by attorneys for the plaintiffs in the same court proceedings, which characterize the activities
of Bank Markazi in the United States as commercial activities. The arguments put forward by Iran
and the United States to describe the activities of Bank Markazi in the United States are practically
the opposite of those made in United States court proceedings by Bank Markazi and the attorneys of
plaintiffs. In the present proceedings before the Court, the two States appear to have taken their cue
from the conclusions of the Court’s 2019 Judgment on jurisdiction, with Iran arguing that those
activities were of a commercial nature, and the United States asserting, on the contrary, that they
were central banking activities  each one trying to convince the Court of their respective points of
view with respect to the possible characterization of Bank Markazi as a “company” under the Treaty.
Under these circumstances, the Court should have been guided by the criteria it laid down in its
2019 Judgment for assessing whether Bank Markazi was carrying out, at the relevant time, activities
of the nature of those which permit characterization of an entity as a “company” within the meaning
of the Treaty.


       22. The criteria laid down by the Court in its 2019 Judgment emphasized the nature of the
activities, since, as it stated, “it is the nature of the activity actually carried out which determines the
characterization of the entity engaged in it” 15. According to the Court’s 2019 Judgment, “the legal
person in question should be regarded as a ‘company’ within the meaning of the Treaty to the extent
that it is engaged in activities of a commercial nature, even if they do not constitute its principal
activities” 16. If the Court’s 2019 criteria were properly applied to the activities carried out by Bank
Markazi at the relevant time in United States markets consisting of the purchase of 22 security
entitlements in dematerialized bonds and in their management and subsequent sale, I am of the view
that such activities would be considered as commercial activities. It follows that Bank Markazi
should have been characterized as a “company” within the meaning of the Treaty in the present
Judgment. This would have entitled it to the treatment provided for such companies under
Articles III (1) and IV (1) and (2) of the Treaty, which the Court has now found to have been violated
by the United States with regard to other Iranian companies. The Court should have, therefore,
upheld its jurisdiction with respect to the third objection raised by the United States and,
consequently, extended its findings regarding the breach by the United States of its obligations under
Articles III (1) and IV (1) and (2) to Bank Markazi.
