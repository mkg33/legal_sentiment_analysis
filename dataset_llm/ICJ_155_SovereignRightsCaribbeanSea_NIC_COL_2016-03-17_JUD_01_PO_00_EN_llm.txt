                        Analysis of the Court — Critical date for establishing jurisdiction — Effects of
                     denunciation determined by first paragraph of Article LVI — Question whether
                     second paragraph of Article LVI alters effect of first paragraph — Second para‑
                     graph confirms that procedures instituted before notification of denunciation can
                     continue irrespective of that denunciation — Proceedings instituted during one‑year
                     notice period are proceedings instituted while Pact still in force — Colombia’s
                     interpretation would result in most of the Articles of the Pact losing effect while
                     Pact still in force — Colombia’s interpretation not consistent with object and pur‑
                     pose of Pact — Colombia’s interpretation not necessary to give effet utile to sec‑
                     ond paragraph of Article LVI — Colombia’s first preliminary objection rejected.

                      Analysis of the Court — Nicaragua’s first claim — Parties took different posi‑
                   tions on legal implications of Colombia’s proclamation of an “Integral Contiguous
                   Zone” in Decree 1946 — No rebuttal by Colombia that it continued exercising
                   jurisdiction in maritime spaces that Nicaragua claimed as its own — Formal pro‑
                   test not a necessary condition for existence of a dispute — At date of filing of
                   Application, a dispute existed concerning Nicaragua’s first claim — Nicaragua’s
                   second claim — No evidence that Colombia used or threatened to use force in area
                   in question before critical date — Colombia’s second preliminary objection rejected
                   with regard to Nicaragua’s first claim and upheld with regard to its second claim.

                      The Court’s consideration of Article II of Pact — Discrepancy between French
                   text and other three official texts of Article II — Approach taken in 1988 Judg‑
                   ment — No need to resolve problem posed by textual discrepancy — The issues
                   identified for possible dialogue between the Parties are different to subject‑matter
                   of dispute — No evidence that the Parties contemplated negotiations on subject‑­
                   matter of dispute at date of filing of Application — Colombia’s third preliminary
                   objection rejected.

                       Jurisdiction already established on basis of Article XXXI of Pact to entertain
                    Nicaragua’s first claim — No need for the Court to deal with Nicaragua’s allega‑
                    tion of “inherent jurisdiction” — No ground for the Court to rule upon Colombia’s
                    fourth preliminary objection.

                    to inherent jurisdiction — The fifth preliminary objection to be addressed in so far
                    as it relates to jurisdiction under Pact of Bogotá — Nicaragua does not seek to
                    enforce 2012 Judgment — Colombia’s fifth preliminary objection rejected.

                    9 	        sovereign rights and maritime spaces (judgment)

                      delivers the following Judgment :
                       1. On 26 November 2013, the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua
                    (hereinafter “Nicaragua”) filed with the Registry of the Court an Application
                    instituting proceedings against the Republic of Colombia (hereinafter “Colom-
                    bia”) concerning a dispute in relation to “the violations of Nicaragua’s­
                    sovereign rights and maritime zones declared by the Court’s Judgment of
                    19 November 2012 [in the case concerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute
                    (Nicaragua v. Colombia)] and the threat of the use of force by Colombia in
                    order to implement these violations”.
                       In its Application, Nicaragua seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on
                    Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement signed on
                    30 April 1948, officially designated, according to Article LX thereof, as the
                    “Pact of Bogotá” (hereinafter referred to as such).
                       Nicaragua states that, alternatively, the jurisdiction of the Court “lies in its
                    inherent power to pronounce on the actions required by its Judgments”.

                        2. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court,
                    the Registrar immediately communicated the Application to the Government of
                    Colombia ; and, under paragraph 3 of that Article, all other States entitled to
                    appear before the Court were notified of the Application.
                        3. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
                    either of the Parties, each Party proceeded to exercise the right conferred upon
                    it by Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the
                    case. Nicaragua first chose Mr. Gilbert Guillaume, who resigned on 8 ­September
                    2015, and subsequently Mr. Yves Daudet. Colombia chose Mr. David
                    Caron.
                        4. By an Order of 3 February 2014, the Court fixed 3 October 2014 as the
                    time‑limit for the filing of the Memorial of Nicaragua and 3 June 2015 for the
                    filing of the Counter‑Memorial of Colombia. Nicaragua filed its Memorial
                    within the time‑limit so prescribed.
                        5. On 19 December 2014, within the time‑limit set by Article 79, paragraph 1,
                    of the Rules of Court, Colombia raised preliminary objections to the jurisdic-
                    tion of the Court. Consequently, by an Order of 19 December 2014, the Presi-
                    dent, noting that, by virtue of Article 79, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court, the
                    proceedings on the merits were suspended, and taking account of Practice
                    Direction V, fixed 20 April 2015 as the time‑limit for the presentation by Nica-
                    ragua of a written statement of its observations and submissions on the prelimi-
                    nary objections raised by Colombia. Nicaragua filed its statement within the
                    prescribed time‑limit. The case thus became ready for hearing in respect of the
                    preliminary objections.
                        6. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of
                    Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the Pact of Bogotá the notifica-
                    tions provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court. In accor-
                    dance with the provisions of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the
                    Registrar moreover addressed to the Organization of American States (hereinafter
                    the “OAS”) the notification provided for in Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Statute
                    of the Court. As provided for in Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the
                    Registrar transmitted the written pleadings to the OAS and asked that Organiza-
                    tion whether or not it intended to furnish observations in writing within the mean-
                    ing of that Article. The Registrar further stated that, in view of the fact that the
                    current phase of the proceedings related to the question of jurisdiction, any written





6 CIJ1092.indb 16                                                                                           15/02/17 08:34

                    10 	       sovereign rights and maritime spaces (judgment)

                    observations should be limited to that question. The Secretary-­General of the OAS
                    indicated that the Organization did not intend to submit any such observations.
                       7. Referring to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Govern-
                    ment of the Republic of Chile asked to be furnished with copies of the pleadings
                    and documents annexed in the case. Having ascertained the views of the Parties
                    in accordance with that same provision, the President of the Court decided to
                    grant that request. The Registrar duly communicated that decision to the Gov-
                    ernment of Chile and to the Parties.
                       Pursuant to the same provision of the Rules, the Government of the Republic
                    of Panama also asked to be furnished with copies of the pleadings and docu-
                    ments annexed in the case. This request was communicated to the Parties in
                    order to ascertain their views. By letter dated 22 July 2015, the Agent of Nicara-
                    gua stated that his Government had no objection to Panama being furnished
                    with copies of the pleadings and documents annexed in the case. For its part, by
                    letter dated 27 July 2015, the Agent of Colombia indicated that although his
                    Government had no objection to Panama being furnished with copies of the
                    preliminary objections filed by Colombia and Nicaragua’s written statement of
                    its observations and submissions, it did object to the Memorial of Nicaragua
                    being made available to Panama. Taking into account the views of the Parties,
                    the Court decided that copies of the preliminary objections filed by Colombia
                    and Nicaragua’s written statement of its observations and submissions on those
                    objections would be made available to the Government of Panama. The Court,
                    however, decided that it would not be appropriate to furnish Panama with cop-
                    ies of the Memorial of Nicaragua. The Registrar duly communicated that deci-
                    sion to the Government of Panama and to the Parties.

                       8. Pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the Court,
                    after ascertaining the views of the Parties, decided that copies of the preliminary
                    objections of Colombia and the written observations of Nicaragua would be
                    made accessible to the public on the opening of the oral proceedings.
                       9. Public hearings on the preliminary objections raised by Colombia were
                    held from Monday 28 September 2015 to Friday 2 October 2015, at which the
                    Court heard the oral arguments and replies of :
                    For Colombia:	H.E. Mr. Carlos Gustavo Arrieta Padilla,
                                    Sir Michael Wood,
                                    Mr. Rodman R. Bundy,
                                    Mr. W. Michael Reisman,
                                    Mr. Eduardo Valencia‑Ospina,
                                    Mr. Tullio Treves.
                    For Nicaragua: H.E. Mr. Carlos José Argüello Gómez,
                                    Mr. Antonio Remiro Brotóns,
                                    Mr. Vaughan Lowe,
                                    Mr. Alain Pellet.


                       10. At the hearings, a Member of the Court put questions to the Parties, to
                    which replies were given in writing, within the time‑limit fixed by the President
                    in accordance with Article 61, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to
                    Article 72 of the Rules of Court, each of the Parties submitted comments on the
                    written replies provided by the other.

                      11. In the Application, the following claims were presented by Nicaragua :
                           “On the basis of the foregoing statement of facts and law, Nicaragua,
                         while reserving the right to supplement, amend or modify this Application,
                         requests the Court to adjudge and declare that Colombia is in breach of :
                         — its obligation not to use or threaten to use force under Article 2 (4) of
                            the UN Charter and international customary law ;

                         — its obligation not to violate Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited in
                           paragraph 251 of the ICJ Judgment of 19 November 2012 as well as
                           Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones ;

                           national law as reflected in Parts V and VI of UNCLOS ;

                         — and that, consequently, Colombia is bound to comply with the Judg-
                           ment of 19 November 2012, wipe out the legal and material conse-
                           quences of its internationally wrongful acts, and make full reparation
                           for the harm caused by those acts.”
                      12. In the written proceedings on the merits, the following submissions were
                    presented on behalf of the Government of Nicaragua in its Memorial :
                           “1. For the reasons given in the present Memorial, the Republic of Nic-
                         aragua requests the Court to adjudge and declare that, by its conduct, the
                         Republic of Colombia has breached :
                         (a) its obligation not to violate Nicaragua’s maritime zones as delimited in
                             paragraph 251 of the Court Judgment of 19 November 2012 as well as
                             Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these zones ;

                         (b) its obligation not to use or threaten to use force under Article 2 (4) of
                             the UN Charter and international customary law ;

                         (c) and that, consequently, Colombia has the obligation to wipe out the
                              legal and material consequences of its internationally wrongful acts,
                              and make full reparation for the harm caused by those acts.
                            2. Nicaragua also requests the Court to adjudge and declare that Colom-
                         bia must :
                         (a) cease all its continuing internationally wrongful acts that affect or are
                              likely to affect the rights of Nicaragua.
                         (b) Inasmuch as possible, restore the situation to the status quo ante, in
                                (i) revoking laws and regulations enacted by Colombia, which are
                                    incompatible with the Court’s Judgment of 19 November 2012
                                    including the provisions in the Decrees 1946 of 9 September 2013
                                    and 1119 of 17 June 2014 to maritime areas which have been rec-
                                    ognized as being under the jurisdiction or sovereign rights of Nic-
                                    aragua ;
                               (ii) revoking permits granted to fishing vessels operating in Nicara-
                                    guan waters ; and
                              (iii) ensuring that the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia
                                    of 2 May 2014 or of any other National Authority will not bar
                                    compliance with the 19 November 2012 Judgment of the Court.

                      13. In the preliminary objections, the following submissions were presented
                    on behalf of the Government of Colombia:
                           “For the reasons set forth in this Pleading, the Republic of Colombia

                      In the written statement of its observations and submissions on the prelimi-

                                                 I. Introduction


                        15. It is recalled that in the present proceedings, Nicaragua seeks to
                    found the Court’s jurisdiction on Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá.
                    According to this provision, the parties to the Pact recognize the Court’s
                    jurisdiction as compulsory in “all disputes of a juridical nature” (see para-
                    graph 21 below).
                        16. Alternatively, Nicaragua maintains that the Court has an inher-
                    ent jurisdiction to entertain disputes regarding non‑compliance with its
                    judgments and that in the present proceedings, such an inherent
                    ­jurisdiction exists, given that the current dispute arises from non‑compli-
                     ance by Colombia with its Judgment of 19 November 2012 in the case
                     concerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)
                    (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 624) (hereinafter the “2012 Judg-
                     ment”).
                        17. Colombia has raised five preliminary objections to the jurisdiction
                     of the Court. According to the first objection, the Court lacks jurisdiction
                     ratione temporis under the Pact of Bogotá because the proceedings were
                     instituted by Nicaragua on 26 November 2013, after Colombia’s notice of
                     denunciation of the Pact on 27 November 2012. In its second objection,
                     Colombia argues that, even if the Court does not uphold the first objec-
                     tion, the Court still has no jurisdiction under the Pact of Bogotá because
                     there was no dispute between the Parties as at 26 November 2013, the
                     date when the Application was filed. Colombia contends in its third
                     objection that, even if the Court does not uphold the first objection, the
                     Court still has no jurisdiction under the Pact of Bogotá because, at the
                     time of the filing of the Application, the Parties were not of the opinion
                     that the purported controversy “[could not] be settled by direct negotia-
                     tions through the usual diplomatic channels”, as is required, in Colom-
                     bia’s view, by Article II of the Pact of Bogotá before resorting to the
                     dispute resolution procedures of the Pact. In its fourth objection, Colom-
                     bia contests Nicaragua’s assertion that the Court has an “inherent juris-
                     diction” enabling it to pronounce itself on the alleged non‑compliance
                     with a previous judgment. Finally, according to Colombia’s fifth objec-
                     tion, the Court has no jurisdiction with regard to compliance with a prior
                     judgment, which is, in its opinion, the real subject‑matter of Nicaragua’s
                     claims in the present proceedings.
                     


                      18. In its written observations and final submissions during the oral
                    proceedings, Nicaragua requested the Court to reject Colombia’s prelimi-
                    nary objections in their entirety (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).

                      19. The Court will now consider these objections in the order presented
                    by Colombia.

                                         II. First Preliminary Objection

                       20. Colombia’s first preliminary objection is that Article XXXI of the
                    Pact of Bogotá cannot provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court,
                    because Colombia had given notification of denunciation of the Pact before
                    Nicaragua filed its Application in the present case. According to Colombia,
                    that notification had an immediate effect upon the jurisdiction of the Court
                    under Article XXXI, with the result that the Court lacks jurisdiction in
                    respect of any proceedings instituted after the notification was transmitted.
                       21. Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá provides :
                            “In conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
                         International Court of Justice, the High Contracting Parties declare
                         that they recognize, in relation to any other American State, the juris-
                         diction of the Court as compulsory ipso facto, without the necessity
                         of any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in force, in
                         all disputes of a juridical nature that arise among them concerning :
                         (a) [t]he interpretation of a treaty ;
                         (b) [a]ny question of international law ;
                         (c) [t]he existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
                              the breach of an international obligation ;
                         (d) [t]he nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach
                              of an international obligation.”
                      22. Denunciation of the Pact of Bogotá is governed by Article LVI,
                    which reads :
                            “The present treaty shall remain in force indefinitely, but may be
                         denounced upon one year’s notice, at the end of which period it shall
                         cease to be in force with respect to the State denouncing it, but shall
                         continue in force for the remaining signatories. The denunciation
                         shall be addressed to the Pan-­American Union, which shall transmit
                         it to the other Contracting Parties.
                            The denunciation shall have no effect with respect to pending proce-
                         dures initiated prior to the transmission of the particular notification.”
                      23. On 27 November 2012, Colombia gave notice of denunciation by
                    means of a diplomatic Note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the
                    Secretary-­General of the OAS as head of the General Secretariat of the
                    OAS (the successor to the Pan-­American Union). That notice stated that
                    Colombia’s denunciation “takes effect as of today with regard to proce-
                    dures that are initiated after the present notice, in conformity with [the]
                    second paragraph of Article LVI”.
                      24. The Application in the present case was submitted to the Court after
                    the transmission of Colombia’s notification of denunciation but before the
                    one‑year period referred to in the first paragraph of Article LVI had elapsed.

                         25. Colombia maintains that Article LVI of the Pact of Bogotá should be
                    interpreted in accordance with the customary international law rules on
                    treaty interpretation enshrined in Articles 31 to 33 of the 1969 Vienna Con-
                    vention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter, the “Vienna Convention”).
                    Colombia relies, in particular, on the general rule of interpretation in Arti-
                    cle 31 of the Vienna Convention, which requires that “[a] treaty shall be
                    interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
                    given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
                    and purpose”. According to Colombia, the application of the general rule of
                    treaty interpretation must lead to the conclusion that procedures initiated
                    after transmission of a notification of denunciation are affected by the
                    denunciation.
                         26. Colombia contends that the natural implication of the express pro-
                    vision in the second paragraph of Article LVI of the Pact that denuncia-
                    tion shall have no effect on pending procedures initiated before the
                    transmission of a notification is that denunciation is effective with
                    regard to procedures initiated after that date. Such effect must follow,
                    according to Colombia, from the application to the second paragraph of
                    Article LVI of an a contrario interpretation of the kind applied by the
                    Court in its Judgment of 16 April 2013 in the case concerning the Fron‑
                    tier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger) (I.C.J. Reports 2013, pp. 81‑82,
                    paras. 87‑88). Moreover, to adopt a different interpretation would
                    deny effet utile to the second paragraph and thus run counter to the prin-
                    ciple that all of the words in a treaty should be given effect. Colombia
                    refutes the suggestion that its interpretation of the second paragraph of
                    ­Article LVI would deny effet utile to the first paragraph of that provision.
                     Even though Colombia accepts that its interpretation would mean that
                     none of the different procedures provided for in Chapters Two to Five
                     of the Pact could be initiated by, or against, a State which had given
                     ­notification of denunciation during the year that the treaty remained in
                      force in accordance with the first paragraph of Article LVI, it main-
                      tains that important substantive obligations contained in the other chap-
                      ters of the Pact would nevertheless remain in force during the one‑year
                      period, so that the first paragraph of Article LVI would have a clear
                      effect.
                         27. Colombia argues that its interpretation of Article LVI is confirmed
                      by the fact that if the parties to the Pact had wanted to provide that
                      denunciation would not affect any procedures initiated during the
                      one‑year period of notice, they could easily have said so expressly, namely
                      by adopting a wording similar to provisions in other treaties, such as
                      Article 58, paragraph 2, of the 1950 European Convention on Human
                      Rights, or Article 40, paragraph 2, of the 1972 European Convention on
                      State Immunity. Colombia also observes that the function and language
                      of Article XXXI are very similar to those of Article 36, paragraph 2,
                      of the Statute of the Court and that States generally reserve the right
                      to withdraw their declarations under Article 36, paragraph 2, without
                      notice.

                       28. Finally, Colombia maintains that its interpretation is “also consis-
                    tent with the State practice of the parties to the Pact” and the travaux
                    préparatoires. With regard to the first argument, it points to the absence
                    of any reaction, including from Nicaragua, to Colombia’s notice of
                    denunciation, notwithstanding the clear statement therein that the denun-
                    ciation was to take effect as of the date of the notice “with regard to
                    procedures . . . initiated after the present notice”. It also emphasizes that
                    there was no reaction from other parties to the Pact when El Salvador
                    gave notice of denunciation in 1973, notwithstanding that El Salvador’s
                    notification of denunciation stated that the denunciation “will begin to
                    take effect as of today”. With regard to the travaux préparatoires,
                    Colombia contends that the first paragraph of Article LVI was taken
                    from Article 9 of the 1929 General Treaty of Inter‑American Arbitration
                    (and the parallel provision in Article 16 of the 1929 General Convention
                    of Inter‑American Conciliation). Colombia maintains that what became
                    the second paragraph of Article LVI was added as the result of an initia-
                    tive taken by the United States of America in 1938 which was accepted by
                    the Inter‑American Juridical Committee in 1947 and incorporated into
                    the text which was signed in 1948. According to Colombia, this history
                    shows that the parties to the Pact of Bogotá intended to incorporate a
                    provision which limited the effect of the first paragraph of Article LVI.
