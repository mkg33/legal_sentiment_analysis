                   To my regret, I voted against points 1 and 2 of the operative part of the
                 Judgment; I did so for the following reasons.

                     1. Both Parties accept that the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 is
                  an international treaty with full legal effect. Nonetheless, it does have a
                  number of significant unusual features. First, it may be asked whether, in
                  the history of contemporary international relations, there have been other
                  treaties in which the States parties are not referred to by name. The text
                  is signed by two individuals, who represent respectively the “Party of the
                  First Part” and the “Party of the Second Part”, and one has to deduce
                  from this that those individuals represent Greece and the former Yugo‑
                 slav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Why was the Treaty concluded
                 between unnamed States? The reason for this curious, uniform way in
                 which the Parties are designated resides in the Parties’ “difference” over
                 the name of the “Party of the Second Part”. That difference is omnipres‑
                 ent in this case, and the other actions of the Applicant and reactions of
                 the Respondent revolve around it.

                  (without mention of the Macedonians), a Kingdom which in 1923 adopted
                  the name of Yugoslavia. After the end of the Second World War (1945),
                  Yugoslavia directed its policy towards incorporating both Greek and Bul‑

                 Greek Civil War (1946‑1949). At the Paris Peace Conference (1947),
                 Yugoslavia called for the annexation of provinces of northern Greece.
                 The rebel movements which Greece confronted on its northern border
                 during the Civil War led to the creation, in 1946, of the first Commission
                 of Inquiry of the United Nations.

                 4 September 1995, the American envoys convinced Andreas Papandreou,
                 then Greek Prime Minister, to agree to the Accord which had been nego‑
                 tiated over a two‑year period thanks to the mediation of Cyrus Vance
                 and Matthew Nimetz, while he himself met on the same matter with Pres‑
                 ident Kiro Gligorov, “once Tito’s Finance Minister [who] had almost lit‑
                 erally invented his country in late 1991 and early 1992” 4. Holbrooke
                 adds that the New York Times had hailed the Interim Accord as marking
                 the end “of a four year dispute that had threatened to break into war” 5.
                 It is important to recall here that, immediately after its independence,
                 the new State embarked upon a series of actions with irredentist aims
                 and acts contesting the Greek cultural heritage, which were considered
                 unacceptable by Greece.

                 accordance with Articles 224 and 133 of the Treaty of Rome. The Court
                 rejected the Commission’s request concerning the indication of provisional
                 measures and the case on the merits was later removed from the list. In
                 respect of the merits, however, it is also important to note that, in his opin‑
                 ion to the Court, the Court’s Advocate General (Francis Jacobs) found
                 that the measures taken by Greece were legitimate and recommended that
                 the Commission’s request and application against Greece be dismissed 6.

                 two countries have been clouded by the problem of the Applicant’s name.
                 That problem, like many others, surfaced in 1991, and ever since Greece
                 has been asking its northern neighbour not to monopolize, in its capacity
                 as a State, the name of Macedonia and to adopt a name which distin‑

                 of Matthew Nimetz. However, the dispute remains unresolved and raises
                 a number of concerns for the stability of relations in the Balkans, which
                 extend beyond the scope of the two countries’ official representations,
                 press or other public and private institutions.

                 tended that in the Interim Accord “[n]either Party is referred to by its
                 constitutional name nor is the provisional reference of ‘the former Yugo‑
                 slav Republic of Macedonia’, as set out in resolution 817, used to refer to
                 the Applicant” 9. That reading, upheld by the Court, is erroneous,
                 because Articles 5 and 11 of the Interim Accord transpose and legally
                 reinforce Security Council resolutions 817 and 845, the first of which
                 clearly advocates the use of the provisional reference FYROM “for all
                 purposes within the organization”. If the Applicant was itself not also
                 required to use the provisional name, then it would have been sufficient to
                 refer to resolution 845 in the Interim Accord. For its part, paragraph 2 of
                 resolution 817 states that, pending the settlement by common consent of
                 the difference over the name, the Applicant is to be “referred to for all
                 purposes” as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, by
                 using the name which appears in its Constitution (“the Republic of Mace‑
                 donia”) in its dealings with and within international organizations, as
                 well as creating confusion among the members of the international com‑
                 munity, the Applicant is failing to comply with its obligation in two ways.
                 Firstly, it is unilaterally claiming for itself an exception to the formula
                 “[is to be] referred to for all purposes”, even though there is nothing in
                 resolutions 817 and 845 to allow it such an exception; use of the reference
                 name is binding for all, without exception, within the international orga‑
                 nization. The two resolutions in question (and the Accord) use the word
                 “name” in the singular, and not in the plural, which makes perfect sense,
                 since they reflect the willingness of the United Nations to strive for the

                    9. With respect to the “difference over the name”, the Applicant adopts —
                 according to the circumstances and sometimes simultaneously — at least
                 two different positions: it claims sometimes that resolution 817 refers to the
                 negotiations over the name and that, accordingly, the provisional name does
                 not concern it, and sometimes that the negotiations concern the provisional
                 name and that, therefore, its constitutional name is not at issue. The Appli‑
                 cant thus contends that the purpose of the bilateral negotiations conducted
                 under the auspices of the United Nations, which have been ongoing for
                 more than 16 years, is simply to reach agreement on the name which will
                 replace the provisional appellation of FYROM, and which is intended solely
                 for use by the Respondent, while the Applicant, for its part, will continue to

                 refer to itself and to have itself referred to, as “Macedonia”. This is what the
                 Applicant calls the “dual formula”, an interpretation which fails to take
                 account of its treaty obligations. It is sufficient to note that the two Parties
                 have already agreed, without any intermediary and by means of the two
                 memoranda concluded between them in 1995, that they will each use, in the
                 interim, the name of their preference. Therefore, what would be the point of
                 the lengthy negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations if the Par‑
                 ties have already reached a temporary understanding, without an intermedi‑
                 ary, in respect of their mutual relations?
                    10. As regards the Applicant’s use of its constitutional name, anyone
                 who has been witness to the activities of international organizations over
                 the past 20 years will no doubt recall the countless points of order raised
                 by Greek representatives against the use of that name, as well as the
                 Applicant’s responses. While voicing its opposition orally and in writing,
                 Greece took account of the fact that that conflict could not be pursued
                 ad nauseum. Through its repeated objections, it nevertheless made its
                 position perfectly clear in the face of the Applicant’s shift towards a “dual
                 formula” not contemplated by the Interim Accord. For international
                 organs and organizations to function smoothly, it is not necessary for
                 those with objections to voice those objections at all times and on every
                 occasion.

                 ceedings in this case demonstrate to the Court that Greece’s position has
                 changed substantially over the years. Initially, Greece’s policy consisted of
                 objecting to any name of the Applicant which contained the term “Macedo‑
                 nia”. Subsequently, and in any event before the Bucharest Conference of
                 3 April 2008, Greece altered its position and made known that it would
                 accept a name that included the term “Macedonia” — on the condition that
                 it was accompanied by a qualifier and that that name should be used
                 erga omnes. The Applicant, on the other hand — speaking through its Pres‑
                 ident or Prime Minister — declared that the international use of a name
                 which differed from its constitutional name was unacceptable (see paras. 32‑
                 33 infra). That position has remained — unchanged for 16 years — the posi‑
                 tion of the Applicant’s successive governments. I do not propose to examine
                 the potential long‑term effects of the usurpation of a name.

                   12. From the various interpretations given in both jurisprudence and
                 doctrine to the notions of the object and the purpose of a treaty, it can be
                 taken as a working hypothesis that the object is stable whereas the pur‑
                 pose is evolving 10. According to the Vienna Convention, the object and

                     13. It is generally recognized that a treaty is no longer characterized in
                 a rigid fashion for the purposes of its interpretation and application 12.
                  The notion of synallagmatic agreement 13 is, however, referred to in the
                 interpretation of a great number of bilateral treaties, because it can be
                 found in every national legal system and serves to clarify the rights and
                 obligations of both States in their contractual relations. Nowadays,
                 ­agreements are characterized as synallagmatic primarily in order to distin­
                  guish them from certain so‑called “normative” or “integral” multilateral
                  treaties, for which the methods of interpretation and implementation are
                  still evolving.
                     14. At the heart of any synallagmatic agreement is reciprocity, a funda‑

                 reciprocity could be considered as unequal. Finally, it would be wrong to
                 conclude that a synallagmatic treaty cannot contain provisions which
                 doctrine and jurisprudence call “normative” or “integral”; it is the con‑
                 struction of the treaty as a whole and not by artificial sections which
                 enables its essential nature to be determined. In that connection, I would
                 point out that the ILC’s Special Rapporteur on the Law of Treaties dis‑
                 tinguished between “reciprocal” or “concessionary” and “integral” obli‑
                 gations in all treaties, bilateral and multilateral. Even in multilateral
                 treaties, reciprocal obligations are those which “provid[e] for a mutual
                 interchange of benefits between the parties, with rights and obligations

                 “reciprocity expresses the idea of an exchange, of a link between that which is given on
                 either side”, p. 100.

                    15. In the context of treaty rights and obligations, the pacta sunt ser‑
                 vanda rule is often invoked (and the Applicant is no exception in that
                 respect). In effect, it is well established that that rule is a fundamental
                 principle of the law of treaties and, as Milan Bartoš explained before the
                 International Law Commission, “the rule pacta sunt servanda is linked to
                 the rule do ut des” 15.
                    16. The Interim Accord is synallagmatic in the sense usually attributed
                 to that category of treaties, meaning that its provisions are closely
                 inter‑connected, and that the rights and obligations of the two Parties are
                 legally dependent on one another. In fact, it is difficult to see what benefit
                 the Respondent would derive from the Interim Accord, other than the
                 regularization of its relations with its northern neighbour by joint accep‑
                 tance of a name which would distinguish one from the other. Therefore,
                 the Court should strive to make the object and purpose of the Interim
                 Accord realizable by emphasizing the need for effective negotiations con‑
                 ducted in good faith, and take care not to prejudice those negotiations
                 directly or indirectly.


                    17. Paragraph 2 of Article 21 excludes from the Court’s jurisdiction
                 “the difference referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1”. That phrase does
                 not simply refer to the fact that the Court does not have jurisdiction to
                 determine the name of the Applicant, which is self‑evident; it goes further
                 and refers to “the difference”. We are all familiar with the “difference”,
                 ever present in the written and oral pleadings.
                    18. It follows that paragraph 2 of Article 21 excludes from the Court’s
                 jurisdiction not only the question of the attribution of a name for the
                 Applicant (which is self‑evident), but also, by the terms used therein, “the
                 difference referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1”; that is to say, it prohibits
                 the Court’s intervention on any question which, according to the Appli‑
                 cant itself, relates “directly or indirectly” to the question of the name. I
                 would add that the exclusion under Article 21 is also linked to Article 22,
                 which reflects Articles 8 and 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty 16, the Court
                 having no jurisdiction to interpret that instrument. By finding that it
                 lacked jurisdiction, the Court would have helped to ensure that the nego‑

                 tiations carried out under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary‑
                 General (paragraph 3 of resolution 845) were meaningful and resulted in
                 the adoption of a name for the Applicant by common consent. It
                 is ­regrettable that the Court assumed a position capable of being inter‑
                 preted as contributing to “faits accomplis”, or which might lead to
                 renewed deterioration of the negotiations. To arrive at that position, it
                 adopted a restrictive interpretation of Article 5, a broad interpretation of
                 the first clause of Article 11 and a restrictive interpretation of the second
                 clause of the same Article.

                 “difference” over the name would restrict or diminish the Court’s jurisdic‑
                 tion is tantamount to neutralizing the effect of Article 21, paragraph 2.
                 But before considering the possible impact of the name issue on individ‑
                 ual provisions of the Accord, it should first be noted that it is precisely
                 because of the unilateral interpretation which the Applicant attempts to
                 apply to its own obligations that the “difference over the name” has, over
                 time, taken on a dimension which could not have been envisaged when

                    21. In order to understand the catalysing role played by the name in
                 the present case, and its significance for the Court’s jurisdiction under
                 Article 21, paragraph 1, it is not necessary to venture into an examination
                 of which of the Accord’s provisions are to be interpreted broadly and
                 which restrictively. The “name” of the Applicant is indicated referentially
                 and in a legally binding manner in two of the Accord’s key provisions,
                 namely Article 5, paragraph 1, and Article 11, paragraph 1, each taken as
                 a whole. It is in considering the effect accorded to those two provisions
                 since 1995, and the manner in which they have been implemented, that
                 the Court’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Application can be
                 determined.

                 tions of which it is a member. Furthermore, it is not the first time that an
                 applicant is seeking to obtain from the Court a ruling on the lawfulness
                 of certain acts of an international organization which is not a party to the
                 dispute. To uphold the Applicant’s thesis means that, for the first time,
                 the highest international court is ruling through a member State on the

                    23. I will now consider to what extent the Court’s finding that it has
                 jurisdiction will influence the effective resumption of meaningful negotia‑

                          application of interim accord (diss. op. roucounas)                729

                 tions aimed at achieving agreement between the Parties on the issue of the
                 name, which represents an obstacle with significant political and cultural
                 consequences not only to the FYROM’s admission to specific interna‑
                 tional organizations, but also to bilateral relations. By upholding the
                 Applicant’s claim and finding that it has jurisdiction, the Court has
                 involved itself in the intricacies of the Parties’ political and cultural rela‑
                 tions with each other and with the international organization in question.
                 Furthermore, in finding that the Applicant’s sustained violations of the
                 Interim Accord within and outside of international organizations have
                 had no decisive effect on the implementation of the Accord, the Judgment
                 implies that the way in which the Applicant interprets the Accord has no
                 connection with “the difference over the name”, which is excluded from

                 the Court to facilitate, so far as is compatible with its Statute, such direct
                 and friendly settlement” (case concerning the Free Zones of Upper Savoy
                 and the District of Gex, Order of 19 August 1929, P.C.I.J., Series A,
                 No. 22, p. 13).
                    24. A composite reading of the Accord would have enabled the Court
                 to discern in the text the need to take account of the historical and cul‑
                 tural elements which loom large over the case and to distance itself from



                     IV. Article 5 and the Obligation to Negotiate in Good Faith

                    25. The Court reduces the interpretation of the scope of Article 5,
                 paragraph 1, of the Interim Accord to its simplest form. That provision
                 stipulates that:
                      “[t]he Parties agree to continue negotiations under the auspices of the
                      Secretary‑General of the United Nations pursuant to Security

                       the difference described in that resolution and in Security Council
                       resolution 817 (1993)”.
                   26. In the two above‑mentioned resolutions, the Security Council urges
                 the Parties to continue to co‑operate in order to arrive at a speedy settle‑
                 ment “of their difference” (resolution 817) and “of the remaining issues
                 between them” (resolution 845). The discrepancy in the wording of these





5 CIJ1026.indb 175                                                                                  20/06/13 08:42

                 two texts demonstrates that, between 1993 and 1995, the “issues to be
                 resolved” multiplied.
                    27. When addressing the question of international negotiations, it is
                 often tempting to make a distinction between obligations of means and
                 obligations of result. In my opinion, that distinction is valid in other areas
                 of international relations. In respect of international negotiations, how‑
                 ever, it belongs to a time past, when diplomacy was first and foremost an
                 exercise in, or art of, intelligence, deceit, semantic subtlety and prevarica‑
                 tion. Nowadays, however, we live in an era of openness and candour.
                 Thus, at a minimum, two States to a dispute are expected to negotiate
                 with a view to reaching a settlement, especially when peace, security and
                 good neighbourliness are at stake. Such is the scope of the now classic
                 phrase “meaningful negotiations”. According to the Court’s locus classi‑
                 cus in the case concerning the North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal
                 Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Nether‑
                 lands) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 46‑47, para. 85), there are
                 various notions as to what the phrase “meaningful negotiations” covers,
                 but all agree that “[t]he duty seems to consist in an obligation on States
                 so to conduct themselves that their negotiations are meaningful, and there
                 is no genuine (good faith) negotiation if each party, or either one, insists
                 on its position and refuses to compromise on any point” 17.

                 Judgment, is a normative and general principle of international law 18, a
                 legal institution requiring harmony between the expressed intention and
                 the true intention, as the Court has repeatedly confirmed. Doctrine and
                 practice (including during the drafting of resolution 2625 (XXV) on
                 “friendly relations”) have clearly underlined the moral aspect of good
                 faith and, in arbitral jurisprudence, it has also recently been recognized as
                 having a “fundamental role and [a] paramount character . . . in the inter‑
                 pretation . . . of all international law and not just in the interpretation of

                 negotiations aimed at settling issues which have not been resolved by the

                 the Court made it clear that “[t]he principle of good faith obliges the Par‑
                 ties to apply it in a reasonable way and in such a manner that its purpose
                 can be realized” (Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia),
                 Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1997, p. 79, para. 142). Finally, good faith pro‑
                 tects parties which have legitimate expectations and justifiably trust in the
                 appearances created by the conduct of the other parties to the treaty 22.
                 Since the theory of the abuse of right is closely linked to good faith 23, it
                 follows that acts flowing from wrongful conduct can have no legitimate
                 effects 24. In this connection, it has been stated that: “to negotiate other‑
                 wise than in good faith is surely not to negotiate at all” 25 and that “good
                 faith is consubstantial with the idea of negotiations” 26.
                    29. All negotiations are thus founded on the parties’ obligation to
                 carry them out in good faith, a principle which the Applicant has con‑

                 gence over the “dual formula” — the issue at the heart of the dispute
                 — which is compromising the negotiations.
                    30. Article 5 establishes a balance between the Parties’ rights and obli‑
                 gations. Right from the outset, its first paragraph addresses the crux of
                 the matter: the requirement of negotiations “with a view to reaching
                 agreement on the difference” — in other words, the adoption of a name
                 (“the name of the Party of the Second Part”) by common consent —
                 firstly over what is meant by “name” and secondly over who should use it

                 first to Security Council resolution 845 (1993), which places the emphasis
                 on negotiations (para. 2), and then to resolution 817 (1993).
                    31. The second paragraph of Article 5 reinforces the first, without pre­
                 judice to the difference over the name, by stipulating that the Parties must
                 facilitate their mutual relations, in particular their economic and com‑

                 the imposition of an embargo by the Respondent) and “shall take practi‑
                 cal measures” to that end. It is well known that, in accordance with para‑

                 Accord, Greece made a significant contribution to the FYROM’s econ‑
                 omy 27 and facilitated the free movement of goods to and from that coun‑
                 try.
                    32. I will now address the facts: in his speech of 3 November 2008
                 before the Parliament of the Applicant, the President of the Republic,
                 Branko Crvenkovski, set out as follows a policy which could be described
                 as a “road map” for all heads of State and Government of that country:

                      to understandable reasons, was never publicly announced, but it was
                      a strategy that all Governments and Chiefs of State have stuck to so far,
                      regardless of their political orientation. A strategy which was func‑
                      tional and which gave results.
                         What were the basic principles of that concept?
                         First of all, in the negotiations under the UN auspices we partici‑
                      pated actively, but our position was always the same and unchanged.
                      And that was the so‑called dual formula. That means the use of the
                      constitutional name of the Republic of Macedonia for the entire
                      world, in all international organizations, and in bilateral relations
                      with all countries, with a compromise solution to be found only for

                      strengthen our proper political capital in the international field which
                      will be needed for the next phases of the process.” 28

                   33. Moreover, on 2 November 2007, i.e., well before NATO’s decision
                 of 3 April 2008, Nikola Gruevski, the Applicant’s Prime Minister, made
                 the following statement:
                        “However, there is one point, which we definitely cannot accept:
                      the one that says that the Republic of Macedonia should accept a
                      name different from its constitutional one for international use. This

                    27 According to the statistics of the FYROM’s National Bank, commercial relations

                 with Greece are substantial: thus, in 2010, Greece was the fourth largest importer of goods
                 from the FYROM and the third largest exporter of goods to the FYROM. The same
                 statistics show that, in the area of foreign direct investment flows, Greece has repeatedly
                 featured among the top five investors in the FYROM and in fact occupied the No. 2 spot
                 on that list in 2004, 2005 and 2006. See http://www.nbrm.mk/.

                    The Judgment remains silent on the potentially destructive character of
                 those statements of the FYROM’s Prime Minister. I would recall the

                         “The material before the Court also includes statements by repre‑
                      sentatives of States, sometimes at the highest political level. Some of
                      these statements were made before official organs of the State or of
                      an international or regional organization, and appear in the official
                      records of those bodies. Others, made during press conferences or
                      interviews, were reported by the local or international press. The
                      Court takes the view that statements of this kind, emanating from
                      high‑ranking official political figures, sometimes indeed of the highest
                      rank, are of particular probative value when they acknowledge facts
                      or conduct unfavourable to the State represented by the person who

                      (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nica‑
                      ragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      1986, p. 41, para. 64.)
                 That jurisprudence is clear and applies independently of when the state‑
                 ments are made (before or after such and such an event), of whether the
                 Respondent should have denounced the violation beforehand, or of any
                 other pretext which would deprive it of its decisive character. The state‑
                 ments of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister of the
                 FYROM are directly governed by that jurisprudence of the Court. I
                 would add that the Judgment fails to cite the statements in question,
                 although it does cite verbatim those of the Prime Minister and the Minis‑

                 “Macedonia”, but which differentiated it from Greek Macedonia. In view
                 of that substantial concession, it is permissible to question whether the
                 Applicant’s actions were in compliance with the generally recognized con‑
                 ditions for the proper conduct of “meaningful” negotiations, and its good
                 faith in a process which has been ongoing for 16 years without success.
                    35. Two examples show how far the Applicant goes in the way it refers
                 to itself: when assuming the presidency of the United Nations General
                 Assembly in 2007 31 and that of the Committee of Ministers of the

                 capacity not simply as members, but as organs of those international orga‑
                 nizations, referred to themselves as the “Republic of Macedonia” and the
                 “Macedonian Chairmanship” 33. Greece of course protested against
                 those violations — which are of differing orders of gravity — of the
                 Interim Accord and of the two Security Council resolutions, but in vain.



                               V. Admission to International Organizations:


                    36. Admission to global international organizations is dependent on
                 the general and special conditions imposed by the founding States in the
                 constituent treaty 34. It should be noted that international organizations
                 are never completely open to all States 35 and that, at the Vienna Confer‑
                 ence on the Law of Treaties (1968‑1969), a proposal that “every State
                 should be entitled as of right to become a party to a . . . multilateral
                 treaty” 36 was rejected. In “closed” or “regional” organizations (like
                 NATO or the Council of Europe), the competent organ can also later lay
                 down additional conditions for admission. Admission is linked to the
                 candidate’s capacity to contribute to what doctrine terms “essentiality or

                 determine subjectively whether all the necessary criteria have been met
                 before giving its assent 39. The consideration of political factors can also
                 be added to the legal conditions set forth by the organization’s constitu‑
                 ent treaty 40, “the vote signif[ying] in effect whether or not there is recogni‑
                 tion of the existence of the legally imposed conditions and whether there
                 is political willingness to admit the candidate State” 41. Moreover, in its
                 Opinion on Conditions of Admission (Conditions of Admission of a State to
                 Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory
                 Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Reports 1947‑1948, p. 57), the Court did not find
                 that every member State had to explain the reasons behind its decision

                            application of interim accord (diss. op. roucounas)                        735

                 organizations are not completely “open”, it follows a fortiori that a can‑
                 didate State cannot be admitted to a military organization for defence
                 and security “unconditionally”.
                    37. In that respect, NATO is entirely typical: it is a military alliance
                 which, by definition, carries out peacekeeping and security operations
                 and ensures the legitimate defence of its members in case of attack. To
                 admit a new member, the member States — once they have determined
                 whether the European candidate State is in a position to further the prin‑
                 ciples of the Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlan‑
                 tic area — decide by unanimous agreement to invite that State to accede
                 to the Organization (Art. 10). It follows that all member States, without

                 State are a source of direct concern is prevented from expressing its opin‑
                 ion, how will the other member States be informed of the real state of
                 those relations, which are, nevertheless, fundamental to their decision? It
                 should be recalled that the well‑known rules of NATO, adopted by the
                 heads of State and Government at the 1999 Washington Summit, subor‑
                 dinate, and for good reason, the accession of Balkan States to good
                 neighbourliness and the settlement of the disputes between those States.
                    38. Since 1999, in the context of NATO’s enlargement to include coun‑
                 tries from Central and Eastern Europe, the heads of State and Govern‑
                 ment have sent a clear message to all accession candidates 43.
                    39. With respect to the present case, and on several occasions, for

                 organs of NATO more specifically indicated to the Applicant, by means
                 of an equally standard formula, that,
                      “[i]n the Western Balkans, Euro‑Atlantic integration, based on soli‑
                      darity and democratic values, remains necessary for long‑term stabil‑
                      ity. This requires co-operation in the region, good‑neighbourly
                      relations, and working towards mutually acceptable solutions to out‑
                      standing issues.”
                   40. The calls for “mutually acceptable solutions to outstanding issues”
                 were diplomatic warnings, which confirm that NATO’s decision did not
                 come “out of the blue”. In order to attribute a reasonable meaning to
                 Article 5, it must, therefore, at the very least be considered in its context

                          application of interim accord (diss. op. roucounas)                736

                      VI. Article 11: Agreeing not to Object if the other Party
                              Fulfils Its Obligations under Article 5,
                                      which Precedes Article 11

                  not to object”, which appears in Article 11. If this phrase is not ­interpreted
                 cautiously, it can have unreasonable, even harmful, consequences. It
                 would be in vain to scour international relations for a treaty which obliges
                 one of the contracting parties “not to object” to the admission and
                 participation of another party in international organizations. When
                 ­
                 ­considering this unusual feature (the explanation for which — if there is
                  one — does not readily come to hand), the Court is undoubtedly bound
                  to assess the effect of that formula on the legal status of members of inter‑
                 national organizations, and to bear in mind the risk that a broad interpre‑
                 tation of it might encroach on the operational autonomy of international

                 priority to the first clause of Article 11, paragraph 1, not only over the
                 second clause of the same paragraph, but also over the rights and obliga‑
                 tions of the other Party in relation to third parties.

                    42. Thus, excessive weight is attached to the first clause of Article 11,
                 paragraph 1, to the point of rendering it unintelligible. The idea that the
                 second clause of Article 11, paragraph 1, would only apply were the orga‑
                 nization to admit the Applicant under a name other than FYROM is
                 completely misconceived. It is not legally tenable, in light both of the
                 treaty and of the specific nature of NATO, to draw a distinction between
                 what happens before admission to the international organization and

                 remain a spectator to the Applicant’s admission to and participation in
                 international organizations, irrespective of the latter’s conduct in relation
                 to the dispute between the two States. Furthermore, that interpretation,
                 through its “ricochet” effect, amounts to denying the other members of
                 the international organization to which the FYROM is seeking admission
                 the right to be informed of the facts concerning the state of relations in
                 terms of security and good‑neighbourliness between their partner, Greece,
                 a member State of the Organization since 1954, and the FYROM, a
                 ­candidate State. It should be recalled that the Applicant’s Minister for
                  Foreign Affairs was clear in his admission that his country’s position
                  would not alter, and that this consisted in the dual formula.

                  graph 1, establishes an obligation “solely upon Greece”. However, that
                  text embodies two rights and obligations which are reciprocally binding
                  on both Parties. It provides that the Party of the First Part agrees not to
                  object, etc., but on the condition that, pending the settlement of the differ‑





5 CIJ1026.indb 189                                                                                  20/06/13 08:42

                 as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). That is, per‑
                 fectly logically, the reciprocal balance between the two Parties. The “clin‑
                 ical” interpretation, on the other hand, amounts quite simply to removing
                 all meaning from the second clause of paragraph 1. Article 11 cannot be
                 read as establishing an obligation solely on the Respondent.
                    45. The two clauses of Article 11, paragraph 1, are of equal weight: the
                 first is dependent on the second. It is not possible to isolate the first clause
                 and, moreover, allow it to stand independently of the Interim Accord as
                 a whole. The first clause of Article 11, paragraph 1, imposes a constraint
                 on the Respondent, but at the same time it offers the Applicant the oppor‑
                 tunity to demonstrate co‑operation and good faith with a view to resolv‑

                 paragraph 1, cannot therefore be dissociated from the rest of that same
                 paragraph, or from the Interim Accord as a whole, and neither can it
                 relate, as the Applicant contends in its Memorial, solely to the “legality of
                 the Respondent’s objection, no more and no less” 46, which — again
                 according to the Applicant — is irrespective of “the merits or demerits of
                 either Party’s position in respect of the negotiations taking place pursuant
                 to Article 5 (1) of the Interim Accord relating to the difference concerning
                 the Applicant’s name” 47.
                    46. In accordance with resolution 817, Greece did not object to the
                 FYROM’s admission to the specialized organs and institutions of the
                 United Nations and, in the years following the conclusion of the Interim

                 international organization or organ concerned admitted it under the
                 name the “former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (FYROM), the
                 Applicant, once admitted, called itself either the “Republic of Macedo‑
                 nia” or simply “Macedonia”, and continued to refer to itself in that way
                 despite the protests of the Greek representatives. In the case of NATO
                 more specifically, the Applicant submitted its application using its dis‑
                 puted name.
                    47. In respect of the Applicant’s admission, it should also be noted
                 that the Alliance’s decision was taken in accordance with the usual prac‑
                 tice, following consultation within and outside the Organization. Since
                 individual views are absorbed into the Organization’s decision, it is

                 That the decision resulting from that consultation was collective can also
                 be seen in the statement made by the President of the Republic before the
                 Applicant’s Parliament:
                       “as regards the dual formula as a possible compromise for solving the
                       dispute we do not have either the understanding or the support of any

                      Member State of the Alliance or the [European] Union. On the con‑
                      trary, that position is considered by everyone, including our major
                      supporters and friends, as a position which obstructs or interrupts the
                      negotiations from our side. That was fully publicly, clearly and explic‑
                      itly announced to us . . . Also, no one in the international community
                      had and has an understanding about a series of our acts and moves
                      made in the past couple of years, which were of no benefit to us, and
                      the Greeks were using them against us as a justification for their vio‑
                      lation of the Interim Agreement. In other words, we unnecessarily lost


                   48. That statement (“we do not have either the understanding or the
                 support of any Member State of the Alliance”) is further confirmation
                 that the Applicant knew that the above‑mentioned concerns represented
                 the collective position of the Alliance and not simply the views of Greece.
                   49. The following remarks made during the press conference of 23 Jan‑
                 uary 2008 by NATO’s Secretary‑General, the Applicant’s Prime Minister
                 and a NATO spokesperson are also significant.
                   Jaap de Hoop Scheffer (NATO Secretary‑General):
                         “So that is how I can describe the atmosphere. That is what is

                      ments. He also recognized the progress that Macedonia did in the last
                      period and of course he stressed the positions where it is necessary for
                      more progress in the future. And I would say again of course, looking

                 Nikola Gruevski (Prime Minister):
                             “About the compromise. We have [the] feeling that when Greece is
                          talking about compromise, they are actually talking about changing
                          of the name and we believe that there are better approach[es] for
                          solving of this issue.” 49
                    50. If Article 11 is considered as a whole rather than in separate sec‑
                 tions, whether there was an “objection” or not becomes a false dilem­ma.

                 consensus of its member States. The officials of the Organization have re‑
                 peatedly stated that there was no veto within NATO. Paragraph 20 of the
                 Bucharest Summit Declaration of 3 April 2008 states, among other things:
                            “Within the framework of the UN, many actors have worked hard
                          to resolve the name issue, but the Alliance has noted with regret that
                          these talks have not produced a successful outcome. Therefore we
                          agreed that an invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Mace‑
                          donia will be extended as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to
                          the name issue has been reached. We encourage the negotiations to
                          be resumed without delay and expect them to be concluded as soon
                          as possible.” 50

                 difference over the name, the Court would be helping to pave the way towards
                 its participation in NATO. The Court was right to reject the FYROM’s
                 request for reparation (point 3 of the operative part of the Judgment).
                    52. A State, unless it has designs on other States, protects its identity
                 by distinguishing itself from others. As far as NATO is concerned, the
                 adoption by each member State of a unique name protects the unity of
                 the Alliance and avoids any unnecessary confusion or conflicts of identity
                 for the members of the armed forces, not only when they are on peace‑
                 keeping missions, but in particular in times of combat and when the
                 “rules of engagement” 51 apply, when it is imperative that there be trust
                 between the members of participating States’ armed forces. As I have

                     51 I experienced first‑hand the need for unity within NATO in the years following the

                 adoption of the First Additional Protocol of 1977 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, when
                 an article by Bernhard Graefrath, “Zum Anwendungsbereich der Ergänzungsprotokolle zu
                 den Genfer Abkommen vom 12 August 1949”, published in Staat und Recht, Vol. 29, 1980,
                 p. 133 et seq., sparked a discussion within the Alliance on the scope of Article 35, para‑
                 graph 3, of that Protocol concerning the use of nuclear weapons and the extent to which
                 it was applicable to the Alliance’s member States, parties and non‑parties to the Protocol.

                 nizations. It is a military alliance and its specific nature weighs heavily on
                 the mutual relations between its member States.

                      VII. The Scope of the Obligations Assumed by the Parties

                    53. The Court’s reading of the phrase “agrees not to object” compro‑
                 mises the Respondent’s established international competencies. This is
                 another reason to repeat that Article 11 must be interpreted as a whole,
                 and not in a fragmented fashion. A balanced reading of Article 11 does
                 not infringe on any entity’s sovereignty or competences. It would also
                 have enabled the Court to find that the Respondent was not prohibited,
                 legally or politically, from making public (which implies that the Appli‑
                 cant was aware of the Respondent’s position) the reasons why, in its view,
                 the Applicant’s deliberate attitude was in breach of the Interim Accord

                 Atlantic Council and other organization officials to the Applicant did not
                 change its unilaterally established road map, which confirms that it has
                 no intention of modifying its conduct. The Applicant is thus seeking
                 acceptance of the idea that, irrespective of its conduct, the Respondent
                 should not object to its candidature.



                     VIII. The “Practice of the Organization”, the Violations of
                              Resolution 817 and of the Interim Accord
                                 and the Protests of the Respondent

                    54. The Judgment refers in several places to the practice “of” the Orga‑
                 nization. What it should refer to, however, is the practice “within” the
                 Organization, that is to say, not simply the conduct of the organs and
                 other components of the organization, but also that of its member States.
                 Moreover, the Court shows a particular predilection, which is difficult to
                 explain, for resolution 817. However that may be, resolution 817 is only
                 incorporated into Article 5 of the Interim Accord to the extent that it
                 invokes “the difference over the name”. Thus, independently of resolu‑
                 tion 817, which is clearly binding on the Applicant within the United
                 Nations, the latter is also bound by the same obligation to use only the
                 name FYROM in any international organization in which it participates

                 without which there can be no “practice”. Although this is mentioned
                 only fleetingly in the Judgment, anyone who has had dealings with inter‑
                 national organizations since 1991 will be aware of the endless disputes,

                            application of interim accord (diss. op. roucounas)                           741

                 both written and oral, between the representatives of the Parties on the
                 subject of the name, as well as Greece’s ongoing and repeated opposition
                 to the Applicant’s use of its constitutional name.
                    56. International protest is a legal concept of customary law, whereby
                 a subject of international law objects to an official act or the conduct of
                 another subject, which it considers to be in breach of international law 52.
                 Protest acquires greater weight when it opposes an act or conduct which
                 is inconsistent with the international obligations of the other subject of
                 international law. It has the effect of preserving the rights of the protest‑
                 ing subject and bringing to the fore the unlawful nature of the official act
                 or conduct at issue. It is further strengthened by and becomes indisput‑

                 well as in the decisions of the Permanent Court and of this Court in the
                 cases concerning Jaworzina (1923), Interpretation of Peace Treaties (1950),
                 Fisheries (1951), Minquiers and Ecrehos (1953), Continental Shelf (1982),
                 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (1984),
                 Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (1992), Land and Maritime
                 Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (2002) and Certain Questions of
                 Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (2008), account was taken either of
                 the protests actually carried out by one or both Parties to the dispute, or
                 of the absence of protest in respect of a given act or situation. The world’s
                 highest Court has never relied on the number of protests at issue in order
                 to determine their legal effect. In the present Judgment, however, it finds

                 protests carried out by Greece against the use by the FYROM of its con‑
                 stitutional name within international organizations in the period from the
                 conclusion of the Interim Accord to the FYROM’s application to join
                 NATO. By introducing a quantitative measure in this way in order to
                 determine the legal status of an international act, the Court undermines
                 the very concept of international protest 53.


                   58. Furthermore, I cannot understand why the Court was not satisfied
                 by Greece’s repeated protests against the use by the Applicant of a name
                 other than the FYROM within international organizations, and against

                    52 See E. Suy, Les actes juridiques unilatéraux en droit international public, Paris, LGDJ,

                    53 It is true that, in its Advisory Opinion on the Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the

                 Service of the United Nations (Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 185), the Court
                 invoked a quantitative measure (“fifty States”), but that measure had no legal effect on the
                 creation by the States of an organization possessing objective international personality.

                 the documents produced by the Respondent, and was able to find some
                 85 protests on its part 54. In seeking to demonstrate the Respondent’s pur‑
                 ported approval of the Applicant’s use of its constitutional name within
                 the United Nations, the Judgment invokes an internal document (non-

                 FYROM’s participation in the day‑to‑day activities of the United
                 Nations; the letter from the Respondent’s Minister for Foreign Affairs
                 refers to the question of the name in its very first sentence following the
                 introductory paragraph, with the body of the text listing a number of
                 other measures which the Applicant was required to take.


                                                IX. Good Neighbourliness

                    59. Legally, the notion of good neighbourliness does not play a major
                 role in the area of international relations. One author of a detailed study

                 obligations vis‑à‑vis other States, because each obligation presupposes
                 the right to claim reciprocity from the other party” 56. A distinction is
                 made between the right of neighbourliness and the right of good neigh‑
                 bourliness, the borders of which are not always clearly defined. Neverthe‑
                 less, both are evolving concepts, and when good neighbourliness is
                 embodied in an international treaty, it becomes a legal principle, to be
                 read in conjunction with the fundamental principles laid down by the
                 United Nations Charter, among which good faith features prominently. I
                 would add that, although that principle is normally applied in the politi‑
                 cal domain, commentaries on the Charter of the United Nations generally
                 accord it a legal sense, namely the mutual right of neighbouring States to

                 organs of the international community, it is also an obligation incumbent
                 on international organizations, which must ensure that it is respected.
                 The importance of good neighbourliness (which limits the Parties’ free‑

                 reason) is apparent a contrario from the Court’s finding in the Oil Plat‑
                 forms case that “the object and purpose of the Treaty of 1955 was not to
                 regulate peaceful and friendly relations between the two States in a gen‑
                 eral sense” (Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of
                 America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II),
                 p. 814, para. 28). The object and purpose of the Interim Accord is pre‑
                 cisely to regulate peaceful relations between the Parties, and that is why
                 provision was made for the Applicant to be referred to provisionally and
                 for all purposes as the FYROM within international organizations, pend‑
                 ing the settlement of the difference by negotiation.

                 in the 1980s in the Balkans by Romania, supported in particular by
                 Yugoslavia 58. Furthermore, it is not by chance that both Security Council
                 resolutions, the Interim Accord and NATO’s communiqués all mention
                 good neighbourliness. Nor is it by chance that Articles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
                 and 10 of the Accord contain provisions in that regard and, for the most
                 part, are directed at the Applicant. It should be recalled that immediately
                 after the FYROM achieved independence in 1991, its constitution, its
                 national flag, and a cascade of actions and statements by its authorities
                 and non‑governmental elements triggered a wave of hostility towards
                 Greece, which was also expressed by irredentist agitators, and through
                 demands aimed at the Greek historical and cultural heritage. The repeated

                 Greece and has been a part of the territory of Greece since 1913), and
                 obliged its authorities to take further measures considered necessary in
                 order for Greece to recognize it. The acts of provocation continued in
                 various forms: irredentist claims concerning the geographical and ethnic
                 frontiers of the FYROM, extending to areas beyond its political borders,
                 school books, maps, official encyclopedias and inflammatory speeches 59.




                             X. Rights and Obligations in relation to Third


                   61. Article 22 reads as follows: “The Interim Accord is not directed
                 against any other State or entity and it does not infringe on the rights and
                 duties resulting from bilateral and multilateral agreements already in
                 force that the parties have concluded with other States or international
                 organizations.” Article 8 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides, for its

                 part: “Each party declares that none of the international engagements
                 now in force between it and any other of the parties or any third State is
                 in conflict with the provisions of this Treaty, and undertakes not to enter

                 recall that the Court does not have jurisdiction to interpret this Article.
                    62. Article 22 is not a “standard clause”. This is evidenced by the fact
                 that when such a safeguard clause is included in a treaty, its wording dif‑
                 fers according to the parties’ objective 60. Article 22 is a response to the
                 concern expressed by those who study the law of treaties and who, taking
                 account of the problems of interpretation and uncertainties caused by the
                 silence of international agreements on the relationship between those
                 agreements and other earlier or subsequent treaties, ask the drafters of
                 such instruments to take care to include specific provisions in that con‑
                 nection, so as to avoid any potential doubt resulting from the interpreta‑
                 tion of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 61. In

                 sions of that other treaty prevail”.
                    63. Provisions such as those contained in Article 22 are designed to
                 cover the whole of the treaty in which they are incorporated. That Article
                 therefore applies to the Accord as a whole and to Article 11, paragraph 1,
                 in particular. NATO is clearly an international organization as referred
                 to in Article 22 and that Article should therefore be read in conjunction
                 with Article 8 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which prevents a member
                 State from waiving its rights and duties towards the Alliance. Moreover,
                 by including Article 22 in the Interim Accord, both Parties were deemed
                 to be aware of its scope in light of the specific military and defence‑related
                 nature of NATO’s constituent treaty.

                 differs from that which I have just given — the Court invokes a decision
                 of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in its Judgment (see
                 paragraph 109). I would question the weight of that decision, since it is
                 well known that the organs of the European Union regularly go beyond
                 the notion of “fragmentation” in distinguishing themselves from general
                 international law. Moreover, the European Commission constantly points
                 out that it is a “general interpretation” in the Union’s “judicial practice”
                 that “its internal order is separate from international law” 62.

                   65. The fact that the Interim Accord also contains provisions relating
                 to the European Union can be explained not only by the sui generis cha­
                 racter of that Union (whether or not it is an international organization in
                 the classic sense), but also by the economic and commercial integration
                 that participation in the Union entails for its member States and by the
                 fact that the matters in question fall within the Union’s jurisdiction. Fur‑
                 ther, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, as amended, provides procedural mecha‑

                 mechanism to deal with incompatibility.


                          XI. Reliance, in the Alternative, on the Principle of
                                   Exceptio Non Adimpleti Contractus

                    66. Latin terms are not always well chosen. However, the exceptio in
                 question expresses a principle so just and so equitable (Diversion of Water
                 from the Meuse, Judgment, 1937, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 70, dissenting
                 opinion of Judge Anzilotti, p. 50 ; ibid., dissenting opinion of Judge Hud‑
                 son, pp. 75‑78) that it can be found in one form or another in every legal

                 follows that Article 60 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
                 is not the sole form of expression of the exceptio. As a defence to the
                 non‑performance of an obligation, it is a general principle of law, as
                 enshrined in Article 38, paragraph 1 (c), of the Statute of the Court. Yet,
                 as the Court found in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary
                 Activities in and against Nicaragua, general international law and treaty
                 law constantly overlap. Article 60 does not deprive the injured party of
                 the right to invoke the exceptio. In particular, it does not make provision
                 for every scenario in which the injured party reacts to the non‑perfor‑
                 mance by the other contracting party of its obligations. It is true that the

                 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Paul Reuter, who attended
                 the Vienna Conference of 1968‑1969 and was Special Rapporteur of the
                 International Law Commission on the Law of Treaties between States
                 and International Organizations, stated that, during the drafting of that
                 provision, the term “or” (and not “and”) between the words “object” and
                 “purpose” had been chosen, so as to give the party claiming injury a
                 greater freedom of action 64. For 16 years, Greece has responded mildly to
                 the Applicant’s practices and, in the case of the latter’s application to join
                 NATO, it did not seek a suspension or termination of the Accord as such.
                 In so doing, it made its position widely known, but without invoking spe‑
                 cific articles of the Interim Accord. We should not allow unthinking for‑

                 procedures determined the precise rights and obligations of the parties. It
                 is, however, important not to lose sight of the wording of Article 65,
                 paragraph 5, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which
                 provides that: “[w]ithout prejudice to Article 45, the fact that a State has
                 not previously made the notification prescribed in paragraph 1 shall not
                 prevent it from making such notification in answer to another party
                 claiming performance of the treaty or alleging its violation”.


                                               XII. Countermeasures

                 development of international law, in the ILC Articles on the “Responsi‑
                 bility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts” 65. In regard to the role
                 of circumstances precluding wrongfulness, the ILC observed that invok‑
                 ing such a circumstance does not “annul or terminate the [underlying]
                 obligation”. Rather, circumstances precluding wrongfulness “provide a
                 justification or excuse for non‑performance”; they “operate as a shield
                 rather than a sword” 66.
                    69. As the Court has noted on several occasions, the adoption of
                 ­countermeasures presupposes, first of all, the prior existence of an inter‑

                 para. 83). In that connection, the Respondent invokes a series of viola‑
                 tions of the Interim Accord by the FYROM, and in particular violations

                 Bucharest Summit. It has, therefore, satisfied the substantive conditions
                 for the implementation of countermeasures.
                    70. Moreover, as the ILC has stated:
                             “Countermeasures are limited to the non‑performance for the time
                          being of international obligations of the State taking the measures
                          towards the responsible State. Countermeasures shall, as far as pos‑
                          sible, be taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of perfor‑
                          mance of the obligations in question.” 67
                    71. The Court reaffirmed the principle of the reversibility of counter‑
                 measures in the Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros case. According to the Court, the
                 purpose of a countermeasure “must be to induce the wrongdoing State to

                 present case, and assuming that the Respondent’s attitude to the subject of
                 the Applicant’s admission to NATO constitutes a countermeasure, that
                 countermeasure is, by its nature, reversible at any time.
                    72. As far as the procedural conditions governing recourse to counter‑
                 measures are concerned, the ILC proposed a provision which constitutes
                 a mix of codification and progressive development of international law.
                 Article 52, paragraph 1, of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of
                 States provides that “[b]efore taking countermeasures, an injured State
                 shall: (a) call upon the responsible State . . . to fulfil its obligations”. To
                 that first condition, the ILC adds a second, according to which the injured
                 State must “notify the responsible State of any decision to take counter‑

                 will be noted in this respect that an attempt to resolve the difference by
                 friendly means — and not the failure of negotiations — is the norm
                 required by customary law. On the other hand, international custom does
                 not appear to demand notification of the decision to adopt countermea‑
                 sures. It is also necessary to point out that neither the Court nor the ILC
                 have specified the exact form of the steps to be taken before the adoption
                 of countermeasures. This lack of precision reflects customary law, which
                 is characterized by a certain flexibility in that respect.

                    73. That leaves the substantive condition governing the adoption of
                 countermeasures, namely proportionality. That principle has long been
                 accepted in State practice and jurisprudence. Its positive formulation has
                 been confirmed by the Court, first in the case concerning Military and
                 Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States

                 also the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear
                 Weapons, I.C.J. Reports 1996, para. 41 et seq., on the application of the
                 principle of proportionality to self‑defence), then in the Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros
                 case; Article 51 of the ILC text on the Responsibility of States provides that
                 “[c]ountermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking
                 into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights
                 in question”.
                    74. In its written and oral pleadings, the Applicant does not respond,
                 or responds only generally, or even selectively, to the concrete examples
                 of violations of the Interim Accord complained of by the Respondent 68.

                 Yet, in its assessment of those violations, the Court fails to address
                 the substance of the issues.
                    75. In conclusion, many of those who read the Judgment will certainly
                 wonder how — whether by deduction or induction — the Court reached
                 its decision.
