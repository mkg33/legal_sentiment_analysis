                      Legal framework — Conditions for intervention under Article 62 of the Statute
                   and Article 81 of the Rules of Court.
                      The capacities in which Honduras is seeking to intervene, as a party or, alterna‑
                   tively, as a non‑party — The status of intervener as a party requires the existence
                   of a basis of jurisdiction as between the States concerned, but such a basis of juris‑
                   diction is not a condition for intervention as a non‑party — If it is permitted by the
                   Court to become a party to the proceedings, the intervening State may ask for
                   rights of its own to be recognized by the Court in its future decision, which would
                   be binding for that State in respect of those aspects for which intervention was
                   granted, pursuant to Article 59 of the Statute — Whatever the capacity in which a
                   State is seeking to intervene, it is required to establish the existence of an interest
                   of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the main proceedings,
                   and the precise object of its intervention.
                      Article 81, paragraph 2 (a), of the Rules of Court — Interest of a legal nature
                   which may be affected by the decision of the Court in the main proceedings — In
                   contrast to Article 63 of the Statute, a third State does not have a right to inter‑
                   vene under Article 62 of the Statute — Difference between right and interest of a
                   legal nature in the context of Article 62 of the Statute — Interest of a legal nature
                   to be shown is not limited to the dispositif alone of a Judgment but may also relate
                   to the reasons which constitute the necessary steps to the dispositif.
                      Article 81, paragraph 2 (b), of the Rules of Court — Precise object of interven‑
                   tion certainly consists in informing the Court of the interest of a legal nature which
                   may be affected by the decision of the Court in the main proceedings, but also in
                   protecting that interest — Proceedings on intervention are not an occasion for the
                   State seeking to intervene or for the Parties to discuss questions of substance relat‑
                   ing to the main proceedings — A State requesting permission to intervene may not,

                   under the cover of intervention, seek to introduce a new case alongside the main
                   proceedings — While it is true that a State which has been permitted to intervene
                   as a party may submit claims of its own to the Court for decision, these have to be
                   linked to the subject of the main dispute.
                      Examination of Honduras’s Application for permission to intervene.
                      Whether Honduras has set out an interest of a legal nature in the context of
                   Article 62 of the Statute — Honduras has indicated the maritime area in which it
                   considers that it has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the
                   decision of the Court in the main proceedings — Honduras has stated that it can
                   assert rights relating to oil concessions, naval patrols and fishing activities in that
                   area — With regard to the area north of the bisector line established by the Court
                   in its 8 October 2007 Judgment in the case concerning the Territorial and Mari-
                   time Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicara-
                   gua v. Honduras), Honduras may have no interest of a legal nature which may be
                   affected by the decision in the present proceedings because the rights of Honduras
                   over that area have not been contested by Nicaragua or by Colombia — By virtue
                   of the principle of res judicata, as applied to the Court’s 8 October 2007 Judg‑
                   ment, Honduras cannot have an interest of a legal nature in the area south of the
                   bisector line established by the Court in that Judgment.

                      Whereas Honduras has claimed that it has an interest of a legal nature in deter‑
                   mining if and how the Court’s 8 October 2007 Judgment has affected the status
                   and application of the 1986 Maritime Delimitation Treaty between Honduras and
                   Colombia, the Court in that Judgment did not rely on that Treaty, in conformity
                   with the principle of res inter alios acta.
                      Whereas Honduras has requested that the Court grant it permission to intervene
                   as a party to fix the tripoint between Honduras, Nicaragua and Colombia, the
                   Court, having clarified matters pertaining to the 8 October 2007 Judgment and the
                   1986 Treaty, does not see any link between the issue of the tripoint raised by Hon‑
                   duras and the current case.
                      Honduras has thus failed to satisfy the Court that it has an interest of a legal
                   nature that may be affected by the decision of the Court in the main proceed‑


                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                       428

                        ment of 8 October 2007 [in the case concerning the Territorial and Maritime
                        Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicara‑
                        gua v. Honduras)] and the tripoint on the boundary line in the 1986 Mari-
                        time Delimitation Treaty, and, on the other hand, the determination of the
                        tripoint on the boundary line in the 1986 Maritime Delimitation Treaty
                        between Colombia and Honduras. In the alternative, Honduras seeks the
                        Court’s permission to intervene as a non-party in order to protect its rights
                        and to inform the Court of the nature of the legal rights and interests of the
                        Republic of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea which could be affected by the
                        decision of the Court in these proceedings.” (Para. 36.)
                    In its Written Observations on Honduras’s Application for permission to inter-
                    vene, Nicaragua submitted
                        “that the Application for permission to intervene filed by Honduras does not
                        comply with the Statute and Rules of Court and therefore [it] : (1) opposes
                        the granting of such permission, and (2) requests that the Court dismiss the
                        Application for permission to intervene filed by Honduras” (para. 39).
                    In its Written Observations on Honduras’s Application for permission to inter-
                    vene, Colombia submitted as follows :
                          “With respect to the request to be permitted to intervene as a non‑party,
                        Colombia has no objection. Colombia has acknowledged that vis‑à‑vis
                        Honduras it is bound by the delimitation agreed in the 1986 Treaty between
                        Colombia and Honduras. However, this is not the case vis‑à‑vis Nicaragua
                        and Colombia has consequently reserved its rights in this area.

                           With respect to the Honduran request to be permitted to intervene as a
                        party, Colombia understands that this request raises issues relating to the
                        Court’s 2007 Judgment in the Nicaragua v. Honduras case to which Colom-
                        bia was not a party. Consequently, Colombia considers that this request
                        falls to the Court to decide under Article 62 of the Statute, taking into
                        account whether the object and purpose of the request relates to interven-
                        tion under Article 62 in the main case between Nicaragua and Colombia or
                        to another dispute not directly at issue in the pending case.”

                           May it please the Court to permit Honduras :
                        (1) to intervene as a party in respect of its interests of a legal nature in the
                            area of concern in the Caribbean Sea (paragraph 17 of the Application)

                         (2) in the alternative, to intervene as a non‑party with respect to those
                             interests.”
                    On behalf of the Government of Nicaragua,
                    at the hearing of 22 October 2010 :
                            “In accordance with Article 60 of the Rules of the Court and having
                         regard to the Application for permission to intervene filed by the Republic
                         of Honduras and its oral pleadings, the Republic of Nicaragua respectfully
                         submits that :
                            The Application filed by the Republic of Honduras is a manifest chal-

                         ment. Moreover, Honduras has failed to comply with the requirements
                         established by the Statute and the Rules of the Court, namely, Article 62,
                         and paragraph 2, (a) and (b), of Article 81 respectively, and therefore
                         Nicaragua (1) opposes the granting of such permission, and (2) requests that
                         the Court dismiss the Application for permission to intervene filed by Hon-
                         duras.”
                    On behalf of the Government of Colombia,
                    at the hearing of 22 October 2010 :
                            “In light of the considerations stated during these proceedings, [the] Gov-
                         ernment [of Colombia] wishes to reiterate what it stated in the Written
                         Observations it submitted to the Court, to the effect that, in Colombia’s
                         view, Honduras has satisfied the requirements of Article 62 of the Statute
                         and, consequently, that Colombia does not object to Honduras’s request
                         for permission to intervene in the present case as a non‑party. As concerns
                         Honduras’s request to be permitted to intervene as a Party, Colombia like-
                         wise reiterates that it is a matter for the Court to decide in conformity with
                         Article 62 of the Statute.”

                                                          *       *

                       18. In its Application for permission to intervene dated 10 June 2010
                    (see paragraph 12 above), Honduras made clear that it primarily sought
                    to be permitted to intervene in the pending case as a party, and that if the
                    Court did not accede to that request, it wished, in the alternative, to be
                    permitted to intervene as a non‑party.
                       Honduras defined the object of its intervention according to whether its
                    primary or alternative request to intervene were granted : if the former, to
                    settle the maritime boundary between itself and the two States Parties to
                    the case ; if the latter, to protect its rights and legal interests and to inform
                    the Court of the nature of these, so that they are not affected by the future
                    maritime delimitation between Nicaragua and Colombia.

                       19. Referring to Article 81 of the Rules of Court, Honduras set out in
                    its Application what it considers to be the interest of a legal nature which
                    may be affected by the Court’s decision on the delimitation between Nica-
                    ragua and Colombia, the precise object of the intervention, and the basis

                                           I. The Legal Framework

                       20. The legal framework of Honduras’s request to intervene is set out
                    in Article 62 of the Statute and Article 81 of the Rules of Court.
                       Under Article 62 of the Statute :
                          “1. Should a State consider that it has an interest of a legal nature
                        which may be affected by the decision in the case, it may submit a
                        request to the Court to be permitted to intervene.
                          2. It shall be for the Court to decide upon this request.”
                      Under Article 81 of the Rules of Court :
                           “1. An application for permission to intervene under the terms of
                        Article 62 of the Statute, signed in the manner provided for in Arti-
                        cle 38, paragraph 3, of these Rules, shall be filed as soon as possible,
                        and not later than the closure of the written proceedings. In excep-
                        tional circumstances, an application submitted at a later stage may
                        however be admitted.
                           2. The application shall state the name of an agent. It shall specify
                        the case to which it relates, and shall set out :
                        (a) the interest of a legal nature which the State applying to intervene
                             considers may be affected by the decision in that case ;
                        (b) the precise object of the intervention ;
                        (c) any basis of jurisdiction which is claimed to exist as between the
                             State applying to intervene and the parties to the case.
                           3. The application shall contain a list of the documents in support,
                        which documents shall be attached.”
                       21. Intervention being a proceeding incidental to the main proceedings
                    before the Court, it is, according to the Statute and the Rules of Court,
                    for the State seeking to intervene to set out the interest of a legal nature
                    which it considers may be affected by the decision in that dispute, the
                    precise object it is pursuing by means of the request, as well as any basis
                    of jurisdiction which is claimed to exist as between it and the parties. The
                    Court will first examine the capacities in which Honduras is seeking to
                    intervene, before turning to the other constituent elements of the request
                    for permission to intervene.

                          1. The Capacities in which Honduras Is Seeking to Intervene
                      22. Honduras is seeking permission to intervene as a party in the case
                    before the Court in order to achieve a final settlement of the dispute





5 CIJ1020.indb 25                                                                                  14/06/13 11:47

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                 431

                    between itself and Nicaragua, including the determination of the tripoint
                    with Colombia, and, in the alternative, as a non‑party, in order to inform
                    the Court of its interests of a legal nature which may be affected by the
                    decision the Court is to render in the case between Nicaragua and Colom-
                    bia, and to protect those interests.
                       23. Referring to the jurisprudence of the Court, Honduras considers
                    that Article 62 of the Statute allows a State to intervene either as a party
                    or a non‑party. In the former case, a basis of jurisdiction as between the
                    State seeking to intervene and the parties to the main proceedings is
                    required, and the intervening State is bound by the Court’s judgment,
                    whereas in the latter, that judgment has effect only between the parties to
                    the main proceedings, pursuant to Article 59 of the Statute. Honduras
                    maintains that in the present proceedings, Article XXXI of the Pact of
                    Bogotá founds the Court’s jurisdiction as between itself, Nicaragua and
                    Colombia. For a State seeking to intervene as a party, according to Hon-
                    duras, intervention consists in “asserting a right of its own with respect to
                    the object of the dispute”, so as to obtain a ruling from the Court on such
                    a right.
                       24. Honduras points out that, unlike intervention as a non‑party,
                    intervention as a party, in view of its object, results in making the Court’s
                    decision on the specific point or points on which the intervention was
                    permitted binding on the intervener, and thus in making Articles 59 of the
                    Statute and 94 of the Charter applicable to the intervener.

                       25. For Nicaragua, whatever the two alternative capacities in which
                    Honduras is seeking to intervene, both would continue to be governed by
                    Article 62 of the Statute and would have to meet the sine qua non condi-
                    tion or conditions laid down by that provision, namely that the State
                    must be able to show an interest of a legal nature which may be affected
                    by the decision in a dispute submitted to the Court. It points out that
                    Honduras, in any event, may not intervene as a party, if for no other
                    reason than the absence of a basis of jurisdiction, since Article VI of the
                    Pact of Bogotá excludes from the Court’s jurisdiction “matters already
                    settled . . . by decision of an international court”. In Nicaragua’s view,
                    Honduras’s argument consists in reopening delimitation issues already
                    decided by the Judgment of the Court of 8 October 2007 (Territorial and
                    Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea
                    (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 659).
                       26. Colombia notes that intervention is an incidental procedure and
                    may not be used to tack on a new case, distinct from the case that exists
                    between the original parties. It accepts that both forms of intervention, as
                    a party and as a non‑party, require proof of the existence of an interest of
                    a legal nature, although it questions whether the same criterion applies to
                    this interest in both cases.

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                  432

                       27. The Court observes that neither Article 62 of the Statute nor
                    Article 81 of the Rules of Court specifies the capacity in which a State
                    may seek to intervene. However, in its Judgment of 13 September 1990 on
                    Nicaragua’s Application for permission to intervene in the case concer-
                    ning Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras),
                    the Chamber of the Court considered the status of a State seeking to
                    intervene and accepted that a State may be permitted to intervene under
                    Article 62 of the Statute either as a non‑party or as a party :
                            “It is therefore clear that a State which is allowed to intervene in a
                         case, does not, by reason only of being an intervener, become also a
                         party to the case. It is true, conversely, that, provided that there be
                         the necessary consent by the parties to the case, the intervener is not
                         prevented by reason of that status from itself becoming a party to the
                         case.” (Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Hon‑
                         duras), Application for Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J.
                         Reports 1990, pp. 134‑135, para. 99.)
                       28. In the opinion of the Court, the status of intervener as a party
                    requires, in any event, the existence of a basis of jurisdiction as between
                    the States concerned, the validity of which is established by the Court at
                    the time when it permits intervention. However, even though Article 81 of
                    the Rules of Court provides that the application must specify any basis of
                    jurisdiction claimed to exist as between the State seeking to intervene and
                    the parties to the main case, such a basis of jurisdiction is not a condition
                    for intervention as a non‑party.
                       29. If it is permitted by the Court to become a party to the proceed-
                    ings, the intervening State may ask for rights of its own to be recognized
                    by the Court in its future decision, which would be binding for that State
                    in respect of those aspects for which intervention was granted, pursuant
                    to Article 59 of the Statute. A contrario, as the Chamber of the Court
                    formed to deal with the case concerning the Land, Island and Maritime
                    Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras) has pointed out, a State permit-
                    ted to intervene in the proceedings as a non‑party “does not acquire the
                    rights, or become subject to the obligations, which attach to the status of
                    a party, under the Statute and Rules of Court, or the general principles of
                    procedural law” (ibid., p. 136, para. 102).
                       30. The fact remains that, whatever the capacity in which a State is
                    seeking to intervene, it must fulfil the condition laid down by Article 62
                    of the Statute and demonstrate that it has an interest of a legal nature
                    which may be affected by the future decision of the Court. Since Arti-
                    cle 62 of the Statute and Article 81 of the Rules of Court provide the legal
                    framework for a request to intervene and define its constituent elements,
                    those elements are essential, whatever the capacity in which a State is
                    seeking to intervene ; that State is required in all cases to establish its
                    interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the
                    main case, and the precise object of the requested intervention.

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                 433

                            2. The Interest of a Legal Nature which May Be Affected
                       31. Honduras takes the view that there are two principles underpin-
                    ning Article 62 of the Statute. Under the first of these, it is for the State
                    wishing to intervene to “consider” whether one or more of its interests of
                    a legal nature may be affected by the decision in the case, and it alone is
                    able to appreciate the extent of the interests in question. According to the
                    second principle, it is for that State to decide whether it is appropriate to
                    exercise a right of intervention before the Court.
                       For Honduras, therefore, Article 62, like Article 63, lays down a right
                    to intervene for the States parties to the Statute, whereby it is sufficient
                    for one of them to “consider” that its interests of a legal nature may be
                    affected in order for the Court to be bound to permit intervention.
                    According to Honduras, if that interest is genuine, the Court does not
                    have the discretion not to authorize the intervention.
                       32. Nicaragua, for its part, sees it as incorrect to contend that a right
                    to intervene exists under Article 62 of the Statute, this being, rather, a
                    right to apply to intervene, since it is for the Court to determine objec-
                    tively whether the legal interest relied upon is real and whether it really
                    may be affected in the case in relation to which it is raised in incidental
                    proceedings. For Nicaragua, the claims of the State seeking to intervene
                    must be credible enough to be seen as a genuine legal interest at stake.


                                                         *
                      33. The Court observes that, as provided for in the Statute and the
                    Rules of Court, the State seeking to intervene shall set out its own interest
                    of a legal nature in the main proceedings, and a link between that interest
                    and the decision that might be taken by the Court at the end of those
                    proceedings. In the words of the Statute, this is “an interest of a legal
                    nature which may be affected by the decision in the case” (expressed more
                    explicitly in the English text than in the French “un intérêt d’ordre
                    juridique . . . pour lui en cause” ; see Article 62 of the Statute).

                       34. It is up to the State concerned to apply to intervene, even though
                    the Court may, in the course of a particular case, draw the attention of
                    third States to the possible impact that its future judgment on the merits
                    may have on their interests, as it did in its Judgment of 11 June 1998 on
                    preliminary objections in the case concerning Land and Maritime Bound‑
                    ary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria) (I.C.J. Reports
                    1998, p. 324, para. 116).
                       35. In contrast to Article 63 of the Statute, a third State does not have
                    a right to intervene under Article 62. It is not sufficient for that State to
                    consider that it has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by
                    the Court’s decision in the main proceedings in order to have, ipso facto,
                    a right to intervene in those proceedings. Indeed, Article 62, paragraph 2,





5 CIJ1020.indb 31                                                                                   14/06/13 11:47

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                    434

                    clearly recognizes the Court’s prerogative to decide on a request for per-
                    mission to intervene, on the basis of the elements which are submitted to
                    it.
                        36. It is true that, as it has already indicated, the Court “does not con-
                    sider paragraph 2 [of Article 62] to confer upon it any general discretion to
                    accept or reject a request for permission to intervene for reasons simply of
                    policy” (Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Application
                    for Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1981, p. 12, para. 17).
                    It is for the Court, responsible for safeguarding the proper administration
                    of justice, to decide whether the condition laid down by Article 62, para-
                    graph 1, has been fulfilled. Consequently, Article 62, paragraph 2, accord-
                    ing to which “[it] shall be for the Court to decide upon this request”, is
                    markedly different from Article 63, paragraph 2, which clearly gives cer-
                    tain States “the right to intervene in the proceedings” in respect of the
                    interpretation of a convention to which they are parties.
                        37. The Court observes that, whereas the parties to the main proceed-
                    ings are asking it to recognize certain of their rights in the case at hand, a
                    State seeking to intervene is, by contrast, contending, on the basis of Arti-
                    cle 62 of the Statute, that the decision on the merits could affect its inter-
                    ests of a legal nature. The State seeking to intervene as a non‑party
                    therefore does not have to establish that one of its rights may be affected ;
                    it is sufficient for that State to establish that its interest of a legal nature
                    may be affected. Article 62 requires the interest relied upon by the State
                    seeking to intervene to be of a legal nature, in the sense that it has to be
                    the object of a real and concrete claim of that State, based on law, as
                    opposed to a claim of a purely political, economic or strategic nature. But
                    this is not just any kind of interest of a legal nature ; it must in addition
                    be possible for it to be affected, in its content and scope, by the Court’s
                    future decision in the main proceedings.

                       Accordingly, an interest of a legal nature within the meaning of Arti-
                    cle 62 does not benefit from the same protection as an established right
                    and is not subject to the same requirements in terms of proof.
                       38. The decision of the Court granting permission to intervene can be
                    understood as a preventive one, since it is aimed at allowing the interven-
                    ing State to take part in the main proceedings in order to protect an inter-
                    est of a legal nature which risks being affected in those proceedings. As to
                    the link between the incidental proceedings and the main proceedings, the
                    Court has previously stated that “the interest of a legal nature to be
                    shown by a State seeking to intervene under Article 62 is not limited to
                    the dispositif alone of a judgment. It may also relate to the reasons which
                    constitute the necessary steps to the dispositif.” (Sovereignty over Pulau
                    Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Application for Permis‑
                    sion to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 596, para. 47.)
                       39. It is for the Court to assess the interest of a legal nature which may
                    be affected that is invoked by the State that wishes to intervene, on the
                    basis of the facts specific to each case, and it can only do so “in concreto

                    and in relation to all the circumstances of a particular case” (Land, Island
                    and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras), Application for
                    Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1990, p. 118, para. 61).

                                     3. The Precise Object of the Intervention
                       40. Under Article 81, paragraph 2 (b), of the Rules of Court, an appli-
                    cation for permission to intervene must set out “the precise object of the
                    intervention”.
                       41. Honduras is requesting the Court, in the context of its Application
                    for permission to intervene as a party, to determine the course of the
                    maritime boundary between itself, Nicaragua and Colombia in the mari-
                    time zone in question, and to fix the tripoint on the boundary line under
                    the 1986 Treaty. In the alternative, the object of Honduras’s intervention
                    as a non‑party is “to protect its rights and to inform the Court of the
                    nature of the legal rights and interests of the Republic of Honduras in the
                    Caribbean Sea which could be affected by the decision of the Court in the
                    pending case”.
                       42. Nicaragua, for its part, takes the view that Honduras is endeavour-
                    ing to convince the Court to rule, in fact, on the course of its own bound-
                    ary with the Parties, and that “the only purpose of Honduras’s hoped-for
                    intervention is to call into question the 2007 Judgment determining its
                    maritime boundary with Nicaragua along its entire length”.
                       43. As for Colombia, it points out that intervention may not be used
                    to tack on a new case, distinct from the case that exists between the ori­
                    ginal parties, but considers that Honduras qualifies to intervene as a non-
                    party under Article 62 of the Statute, and that it is for the Court to go
                    further, if it so decides, by allowing that State to intervene as a party.


                                                         *
                       44. The Court recalls that Honduras’s request for permission to inter-
                    vene is an incidental procedure and that, whatever the form of the
                    requested intervention, as a party or as a non‑party, the State seeking to
                    intervene is required by the Statute to demonstrate the existence of a legal
                    interest which may be affected by the decision of the Court in the main
                    proceedings. It follows that the precise object of the intervention must be
                    connected with the subject of the main dispute between Nicaragua and
                    Colombia.
                       45. The Court points out, moreover, that the written and oral proceed-
                    ings concerning the Application for permission to intervene must focus on
                    demonstrating the interest of a legal nature which may be affected ; these
                    proceedings are not an occasion for the State seeking to intervene or for
                    the Parties to discuss questions of substance relating to the main proceed-
                    ings, which the Court cannot take into consideration during its examina-
                    tion of whether to grant a request for permission to intervene.

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                 436

                       46. As the Court has previously stated, the raison d’être of intervention
                    is to enable a third State, whose legal interest might be affected by a pos-
                    sible decision of the Court, to participate in the main case in order to
                    protect that interest (see paragraph 38 above).
                       47. The Court notes that a State requesting permission to intervene
                    may not, under the cover of intervention, seek to introduce a new case
                    alongside the main proceedings. While it is true that a State which has
                    been permitted to intervene as a party may submit claims of its own to the
                    Court for decision, these have to be linked to the subject of the main dis-
                    pute. The fact that a State is permitted to intervene does not mean that it
                    can alter the nature of the main proceedings, since intervention “cannot be
                    [a proceeding] which transforms [a] case into a different case with different
                    parties” (Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Hondu‑
                    ras), Application for Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                    1990, p. 134, para. 98 ; see also Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/
                    Malta), Application for Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                    1984, p. 20, para. 31).
                       48. Therefore, the purpose of assessing the connection between the
                    precise object of the intervention and the subject of the dispute is to
                    enable the Court to ensure that a third State is actually seeking to protect
                    its legal interests which may be affected by the future judgment.

                                 II. Examination of Honduras’s Request for
                                           Permission to Intervene

                       49. In specifying its interests of a legal nature that may be affected by
                    the decision of the Court, Honduras in its Application states that the
                    1986 Maritime Delimitation Treaty between Honduras and Colombia
                    (hereinafter referred to as “the 1986 Treaty”) recognizes that the area
                    north of the 15th parallel and east of the 82nd meridian involves Hondu-
                    ras’s legitimate rights and interests of a legal nature (see sketch‑map
                    below, p. 441). Honduras argues that the Court should, in its decision in
                    the present case, take full account of such rights and interests in the
                    above‑mentioned area, which, it maintains, were not addressed in the
                    2007 Judgment of the Court in the case concerning Territorial and Mari‑
                    time Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea
                    (Nicaragua v. Honduras) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 658)
                    (hereinafter referred to as “the 2007 Judgment”). Since the Court is going
                    to determine the allocation of the “delimitation area” proposed by Nica-
                    ragua in the main proceedings, Honduras is of the view that the Court
                    will inevitably have to decide whether the 1986 Treaty is in force and
                    whether it does or does not accord Colombia rights in the area in dispute
                    between Colombia and Nicaragua. Therefore Honduras maintains that
                    the status and substance of the 1986 Treaty are at stake in the present
                    case.





5 CIJ1020.indb 37                                                                                   14/06/13 11:47

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                437

                       50. Honduras claims that by virtue of the 1986 Treaty, in the area east
                    of the 82nd meridian, it is still entitled to certain sovereign rights and
                    jurisdiction such as oil concessions, naval patrols and fishing activities.
                    Honduras contends that Nicaragua as a third party to the 1986 Treaty
                    cannot rely on the said treaty to maintain that the maritime area in ques-
                    tion appertains to Nicaragua alone. Honduras is convinced that, without
                    its participation as an intervening State, the decision of the Court may
                    irreversibly affect its legal interests if the Court is eventually to uphold
                    certain claims put forward by Nicaragua.

                       51. Honduras argues that the 2007 Judgment did not settle the entire
                    Caribbean Sea boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras. In its opin-
                    ion, the fact that the arrow on the bisector boundary appearing on one of
                    the sketch‑maps in the 2007 Judgment stops at the 82nd meridian,
                    together with the wording of the dispositif of the Judgment, indicates that
                    the Court made no decision about the area lying east of that meridian
                    (see sketch‑map below, p. 441). According to Honduras, because the
                    Court in the 2007 Judgment did not rule on the 1986 Treaty, a matter
                    that the Court was not asked to address, there still exists uncertainty to
                    be resolved in regard to the respective sovereign rights and jurisdiction of
                    the three States in the area, namely, Honduras, Colombia and Nicaragua.
                    To be more specific, Honduras takes the view that the Court has not
                    determined the final point of the boundary between Honduras and Nica-
                    ragua, nor has it specified that the final endpoint will lie on the azimuth
                    of the bisector boundary line. As the object of its Application, Honduras is
                    requesting the Court, in the event it is granted permission to intervene as
                    a party, to fix the tripoint between Honduras, Nicaragua and Colombia,
                    and thus to reach a final settlement of maritime delimitation in the area.
                       52. In explaining its understanding of the effect of the 2007 Judgment
                    with respect to the legal reasoning stated in paragraphs 306 to 319 of the
                    Judgment under the heading “Starting‑point and endpoint of the mari-
                    time boundary”, Honduras contends that these paragraphs are not part
                    of res judicata, and that, in paragraph 319, the Court was not ruling on a
                    specific matter, but rather indicating to the Parties the methodology it
                    could use without prejudging a final endpoint, and without prejudging
                    which State or States could be considered as the third States. Thus, in its
                    view, paragraph 319 does not rule upon any matter at all and res judicata
                    in principle only applies to the dispositif of the Judgment.

                       53. Nicaragua and Colombia, the Parties to the main proceedings,
                    hold different positions towards Honduras’s request. Nicaragua is defi-
                    nitely opposed to the Application by Honduras for permission to inter-
                    vene, either as a party or a non‑party. Nicaragua takes the position that
                    Honduras’s request fails to identify any interest of a legal nature that may
                    be affected by the decision of the Court as required by Article 62 of the
                    Statute and challenges the res judicata of the 2007 Judgment.

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                 438

                       54. Nicaragua contends that Honduras has no interest of a legal nature
                    south of the delimitation line fixed by the Court in the 2007 Judgment,
                    including the area bounded by that line in the north and the 15th parallel
                    in the south. According to Nicaragua, the 1986 Treaty cannot be relied
                    on against it because it encroaches on its sovereign rights. Nicaragua
                    argues that the 2007 Judgment, with full force of res judicata, settles the
                    entire Caribbean Sea boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras, and
                    that res judicata extends not only to the dispositif, but also to the reason-
                    ing, in so far as it is inseparable from the operative part. Nicaragua is of
                    the view that the Application instituted by Honduras attempts to reopen
                    matters between Nicaragua and Honduras that have already been decided
                    by the Court and therefore should be barred by the principle of res judi‑
                    cata.
                       55. Colombia, on the other hand, is of the view that Honduras has
                    satisfied the test to intervene as a non-party in the case under Article 62
                    of the Statute. Moreover, it raises no objection to the request of Hondu-
                    ras to intervene as a party. Colombia focused its arguments on the effect
                    of the 2007 Judgment on the legal rights of Colombia vis‑à‑vis Nicaragua
                    in the area which the 1986 Treaty covers. Colombia asserted that its bilat-
                    eral obligations towards Honduras under the 1986 Treaty did not prevent
                    it from claiming in the present proceedings rights and interests in the area
                    north of the 15th parallel and east of the 82nd meridian as against Nica-
                    ragua, because what it had committed to Honduras under the 1986 Treaty
                    was only applicable to Honduras.


                                                            *
                       56. According to Article 62 of the Statute and Article 81 of the Rules
                    of Court, the State applying to intervene has to satisfy certain conditions
                    in order for intervention to be permitted. Either as a party or a non‑party,
                    the State requesting permission to intervene should demonstrate to the
                    Court that it has an interest of a legal nature that may be affected by the
                    decision of the Court in the main proceedings. The Court, in ascertaining
                    whether Honduras has or has not met the criteria in Article 62 of the
                    Statute concerning intervention, will first of all examine the interests as
                    claimed by Honduras in its Application. The Court is mindful, as stated
                    previously, that in analysing such interests, the Court neither has the
                    intention to construe the meaning or scope of the 2007 Judgment in the
                    sense of Article 60 of the Statute, nor to address any subject‑matter that
                    should be dealt with at the merits phase of the main proceedings (see
                    paragraph 45 above). The Court must not in any way anticipate its deci-
                    sion on the merits (see Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute
                    (El Salvador/Honduras), Application for Permission to Intervene, Judg‑
                    ment, I.C.J. Reports 1990, p. 118, para. 62).

                                 territorial and maritime dispute (judgment)                   439

                             1. The Interest of a Legal Nature Claimed by Honduras
                      57. The Court will first examine the interest that Honduras has claimed
                    for protection by intervention. Honduras indicates that the zone contain-
                    ing its interest of a legal nature that may be affected by the decision of
                    the Court lies within a roughly rectangular area as illustrated in the
                    sketch‑map attached herewith on page 441. It further states that the
                    south line and the east line of the rectangle, that are identical with the
                    boundary in the 1986 Treaty, run as follows :
                           “[S]tarting from the 82nd meridian, the boundary goes due east
                         along the 15th parallel until it reaches meridian 79° 56´ 00˝. It then
                         turns due north along that meridian. Some distance to the north, it
                         turns to follow an approximate arc to the west of some cays and
                         Serranilla Bank, until it reaches a point north of the cays . . .”
                       58. The Court observes that Honduras, in order to demonstrate that it
                    has an interest of a legal nature in the present case, contends that it is
                    entitled to claim sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the maritime area
                    in the rectangle. In concrete terms, Honduras states that it can assert
                    rights relating to oil concessions, naval patrols and fishing activities in
                    that area. In its arguments, Honduras raises a number of issues that
                    directly put into question the 2007 Judgment, in which the maritime
                    boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua was delimited.
                       59. Honduras’s interest of a legal nature relates essentially to two
                    issues : whether the 2007 Judgment has settled the entire maritime bound-
                    ary between Honduras and Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea and what
                    effect, if any, the decision of the Court in the pending proceedings will
                    have on the rights that Honduras enjoys under the 1986 Treaty.


                       60. In its Application, Honduras explains that it and Colombia possess
                    rights in the maritime zone north of the 15th parallel as they are gener-
                    ated by the Honduran coast, on the one hand, and by the Archipelago of
                    San Andrés, Serranilla and the island of Providencia, on the other. Due
                    to their overlapping claims, the 1986 Treaty was concluded. The Court
                    cannot fail to observe that Honduras’s position on the status of the
                    15th parallel as stated in the present case is not raised for the first time as
                    between Honduras and Nicaragua. As a matter of fact, it was duly con-
