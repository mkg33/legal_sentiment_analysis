In addition to the joint declaration, which reflects my disagreement
with the grounds which led the Court to conclude that it had no jurisdic-
tion in the instant case, I deem it necessary to elaborate further on some
aspects. At the outset, I would like to emphasize that regardless of the
conclusion that the Court reaches on the issue of jurisdiction, and not-
withstanding the fact that the Judgment is confined to deciding on juris-
diction, the Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,
is always called upon to uphold the law of the Charter. The Court, how-
ever, confined its conclusion in the instant case to noting, in para-
graph 115 of the Judgment, that:

“When, however, as in the present case, the Court comes to the
conclusion that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the claims made
in the Application, it can make no finding, nor any observation
whatever, on the question whether any such violation has been com-
mitted or any international responsibility incurred.”

On this point I am inclined to favour the balance reached by the Court in
the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, where it held that:

“55. There is a fundamental distinction between the acceptance
by a State of the Court’s jurisdiction and the compatibility of par-
ticular acts with international law. The former requires consent. The
latter question can only be reached when the Court deals with the
merits, after having established its jurisdiction and having heard full
legal argument by both parties.

56. Whether or not States accept the jurisdiction of the Court,
they remain in all cases responsible for acts attributable to them that
violate the rights of other States.” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.
Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1998,
p. 456.)

1. The Court finds that it has no jurisdiction in this case because the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)! did not have access to the Court
at the time it filed its Application. The first ground upon which the
Court makes this finding is Article 35, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
Court.

2. Article 35, paragraph 1, provides that “[t]he Court shall be open to
the States parties to the present Statute”. Under Article 93, paragraph 1,
of the United Nations Charter, all “Members of the United Nations are
ipso facto [States] parties”. The Court holds that the FRY was not a
State party to the Statute because the FRY was not a Member of the
United Nations at the time it filed its Application in the instant case, and
therefore, in the view of the Court, the Court was not “open” to the
FRY. Because, in my view, the FRY was a Member of the United
Nations when it filed its Application, I disagree.

3. Prior to its fragmentation, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia (SFRY) consisted of six republics: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Macedonia, Slovenia, and Montenegro. On 25 June 1991,
Croatia and Slovenia both declared independence, followed by Macedo-
nia on 17 September 1991, and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 March 1992.
On 22 May 1992, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were
admitted as Members of the United Nations. The “Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia” was admitted to membership in the United
Nations on 8 April 1993.

4, The FRY came into being on 27 April 1992. On that date, a joint
session of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia and the
Assembly of the Republic of Montenegro proclaimed a new constitution
of the “Federal Republic of Yugoslavia”, and also adopted a Declara-
tion. The preamble of the Declaration claimed to reflect the common will
of the citizens of Serbia and Montenegro “to stay in the common State of
Yugoslavia”, and also provided that:

“The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continuing the state, inter-
national, legal and political personality of the [Socialist Federal
Republic] of Yugoslavia, shall strictly abide by all the commitments
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed interna-
tionally.

Remaining bound by all obligations to international organisations

! On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officially changed its name
to “Serbia and Montenegro” (FRY-SM).



and institutions whose member it is, the Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia shall not obstruct the newly formed states to join these organi-
sations and institutions, particularly the United Nations and its
specialised agencies.”

5. The Declaration was brought to the attention of the United Nations
by a Note of the same date informing the Secretary-General that

“[s]trictly respecting the continuity of the international personality
of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall continue to
fulfil all the rights conferred to, and obligations assumed by, the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in international relations,
including its membership in all international organizations and
participation in international treaties ratified or acceded to by
Yugoslavia” 3,

At that time, April 1992, no resolution purporting to oppose or under-
mine the FRY’s assertion was adopted by any competent United Nations
organ and the FRY’s membership was not challenged. This fact suggests
that the FRY was at the time considered to be a United Nations
Member.

6. In September 1992, the Security Council and the General Assembly
each adopted a resolution declaring “that the Federal Republic of Yugo-

Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 70.)

Indeed, the FRY actively participated in proceedings before this Court:
it responded to claims with counter-claims; it submitted preliminary
objections, and it appointed an ad hoc judge to participate in the Court’s
deliberations. All these actions confirmed that the FRY was considered a
Member of the United Nations and a party to the Statute.

10. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY), when it also considered the question whether the FRY was a
member of the United Nations during this period, reached the same con-
clusion. It held that:

“Resolution 47/1 did not deprive the FRY of all the attributes of
United Nations membership: the only practical consequence was its
inability to participate in the work of the General Assembly, its sub-
sidiary organs, conferences or meetings convened by it. Apart from
that, it continued to function as a member of the United Nations in
many areas of the work of the United Nations . . . Thus, while the
FRY’s membership was lost for certain purposes, it was retained for
others . . . The proper approach to the issue of the FRY membership
of the United Nations in the period between 1992 and 2000 is not
one that proceeds on a[n] a priori, doctrinaire assumption that its
exclusion from participation in the work of the General Assembly
necessarily meant that it was no longer a member of the United
Nations. As the FRY membership was neither terminated nor sus-
pended by General Assembly resolution 47/1, it is more appropriate
to make a determination of its United Nations membership in that
period on an empirical, functional and case-by-case basis.” 8

Applying this “functional” approach, the Trial Chamber concluded that

ber 20001°, as was found in the 2003 Application for Revision case,

“cannot have changed retroactively the sui generis position which the
FRY found itself in vis-a-vis the United Nations over the period
1992 to 2000, or its position in relation to the Statute of the Court”
(Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the
Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herze-
govina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections ( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia
and Herzegovina), Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 31, para. 71;
emphasis added).

one that “could not have amounted to its membership in the Organiza-
tion” (Judgment, para. 77) and held that the FRY’s admission to the
United Nations in 2000 “did not have and could not have had, the effect
of dating back to the time when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia broke up and disappeared” (ibid. ). This, in my view, lacks a solid
legal basis. Whereas the Security Council and General Assembly were
acting in a political capacity when the relevant resolutions were adopted,
the Court, throughout the various phases of the cases related to the
former Yugoslavia, should have consistently stated and applied the appli-

1. The FRY did not invoke Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s
Statute as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. The Court decided proprio
motu to address it!?, holding that the FRY, as a non-party to the Statute,
could not invoke a treaty which entered into force after the entry into
force of the Statute as a basis for access to the Court under Article 35,
paragraph 2. I have explained the reasons for my disagreement with the
Court’s conclusion that the FRY was not a Member of the United
Nations in 1999. However, assuming that it was a non-Member, I also
cannot agree that it would not have access to the Court under the pro-
visions of Article 35, paragraph 2.

2. Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute provides that:

“The conditions under which the Court shall be open to other
States shall, subject to the special provisions contained in treaties in
force, be laid down by the Security Council, but in no case shall such
conditions place the parties in a position of inequality before the
Court.”

3. There are two questions relevant to an Article 35, paragraph 2,
examination: first, whether a “treaty in force” may provide a basis for the
Court’s jurisdiction instead of, rather than in combination with, compli-
ance with the requirements laid down by the Security Council in its reso-
lution 9 of 1946; and second, whether the Genocide Convention can be
considered a “treaty in force”.

12 Although the Court is free to decide the issues submitted to it by the Parties for
reasons other than those advanced by the Parties, it is undesirable as a matter of judicial
policy for the Court to raise proprio motu a legal argument that is not determinative of
one of the Applicant’s submissions, unless there are “compelling considerations of inter-
national justice and of development of international law which favour a full measure of
exhaustiveness” on the matter. Compare Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.
United States of America), I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 232, para. 27, separate opinion of
Judge Higgins (“it is unlikely to be ‘desirable’ to deal with important and difficult matters,
which are gratuitous to the determination of a point of law put by the Applicant in its
submissions”) with Lauterpacht, The Development of International Law by the Interna-
tional Court, 1982, p. 37.



4. In respect of the first question, I agree with the Court’s previous
finding that

“proceedings may validly be instituted by a State against a State
which is a party to such a special provision in a treaty in force, but
is not party to the Statute, and independently of the conditions laid
down by the Security Council in its resolution 9 of 1946” (Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, Provisional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993,
LC.J. Reports 1993, p. 14, para. 19; emphasis added) !3.

5. In regard to the second question, I agree with the Court’s previous
finding that “Article IX of the Genocide Convention . . . could . . . be
regarded prima facie as a special provision contained in a treaty in force
[so as to come] prima facie within the jurisdiction ratione personae of the
Court” (ibid.). The Court now holds, however, that “treaty in force”
means a “treaty in force at the time that the Court’s Statute came into
force”, and therefore concludes that the Genocide Convention, having
come into force after the Court’s Statute, does not give the FRY access
to the Court under Article 35, paragraph 2.

“The access of other [non-members of the League of Nations] States to the Court
will depend either on the special provisions of the Treaties in force (for example the
provisions of the Treaties of Peace concerning the rights of minorities, labour, etc.) or
else on a resolution of the Council.” (Emphasis added.)

7. Even assuming — without deciding # — that the Court is correct in
holding that the term “treaties in force” should be given a more restric-
tive interpretation than the interpretation it is given when it appears in
Articles 36 and 37, in my view the interpretation adopted by the Court —
limiting “treaties in force” to treaties in force at the time the Court’s
Statute came into force — is unduly restrictive.

might provide non-League Members access to the Court!”.

against international law. The Convention was the first post-war treaty in
the area of human rights and was considered to be the United Nations’
first concrete legal response to the Holocaust. The philosophy, object and
purpose of the Convention as a whole are a direct outcome of the tragic
events of the Second World War. Thus, when the Convention was
drafted, it was stressed that

“Having regard to the troubled state of the world, it was essential
that the convention should be adopted as soon as possible, before
the memory of the barbarous crimes which had been committed
faded from the minds of men.”

12. The fact that the Genocide Convention came into force after the
Statute of the Court does not change this conclusion. The PCIJ drafters
clearly contemplated that the treaties “in force” under Article 35 included
not only those that were already in force, but also treaties granting non-
League Members access to the Court which were still in draft form and
under negotiation?!

13. This is confirmed in the Permanent Court’s jurisprudence in the
Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia case (P.C.LJ., Series A,
No. 6). In this case, Germany, a non-League Member, was the applicant

treaties addressing jus cogens violations which have largely emerged in
the post-Second World War era.

17. Because of the overriding importance of such treaties to the pro-
gressive development of international law and the maintenance of peace,
they are, and should be, subject to a special interpretation. Cf. Article 60,
paragraph 5, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (non-
applicability of treaty termination rules to “provisions relating to the
protection of the human person contained in treaties of a humanitarian
character”); the Court’s Advisory Opinion on Reservations to the Geno-
cide Convention (limiting ability of States to enter reservations to the
Genocide Convention) (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports
1951, p. 24), and Order on counter-claims in the Application of the Geno-

tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Counter-Claims, Order of
17 December 1997, LC.J. Reports 1997, p. 258, para. 35).

1. The Court found that the FRY did not have access to the
Court and the Court did not therefore consider it necessary to decide
whether the FRY was or was not a party to the Genocide Convention
at the time it filed its Application. In my view, the FRY did have access
to the Court under the provisions of Article 35 and I shall proceed to

the sui generis position which the FRY found itself in vis-à-vis

relation to the Statute of the Court and the Genocide Convention.
Furthermore, the letter of the Legal Counsel of the United Nations



dated 8 December 2000 cannot have affected the FRY’s position in
relation to treaties.

The Court also observes that, in any event, the said letter did not
contain an invitation to the FRY to accede to the relevant conven-

11. In its 1996 Judgment on preliminary objections in Application of

cide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), the Court left open the
question whether it accepted the automatic succession argument, and
confined its Judgment to noting that:

“Without prejudice as to whether or not the principle of ‘auto-

The FRY had every right to claim the continuity of the legal person-
ality of its predecessor with respect of the territory of Serbia and Mon-
tenegro. In the FRY’s case, however, the competent United Nations
organs opted to disregard the law of the Charter. The legal consequences
of the FRY’s “sui generis” status vis-à-vis the United Nations — it was
excluded from participating in certain activities of specified organs but
was never expelled — were not, in my view, properly addressed by the
Court. As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court’s
function under Article 38 of its Statute is to decide disputes in accordance

However, because I consider that the Court does not have jurisdiction
ratione materiae, 1 find myself in agreement with the dispositif contained
in paragraph 116 of the Judgment, which states that the Court “//Jinds
that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the claims made in the Application
filed by Serbia and Montenegro on 29 April 1999”. 1 was therefore able
to vote in favour of the Judgment.
