                     UNCLOS sets up a régime that is special, contractual and confined to States
                     parties to UNCLOS — Majority invents a “condition” which results in application
                     of treaty obligations between a State party and a non‑State party — Incompatible
                     with régime envisaged by Law of Treaties.

                     therein, I am of the opinion that Colombia’s third preliminary objection
                     should be upheld. The Court “has already adjudicated” Nicaragua’s
                     request in Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)
                     (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 624, hereinafter referred to as the
                     “2012 Judgment”) (see paragraph 47 of the Judgment) and Nicaragua’s
                     request is thus res judicata.

                       2. I write this declaration to elaborate further upon a particular con‑
                     cern that arises from today’s Judgment, in which the majority embraces
                     and applies dicta contained within the 2012 Judgment in such a way as to

                     209 	 delimitation of the continental shelf (decl. robinson)

                     non‑States parties consent 2, or the relevant rights and obligations also
                     form part of customary international law 3.
                        4. Treaties are binding on States because they have so consented. This
                     consent is an expression of the principles of sovereignty and equality of
                     States 4. In giving their consent, States agree to respect the obligations,
                     and benefit from the corollary rights, vis‑à‑vis other States parties to the
                     treaty. The Permanent Court of International Justice emphasized that:
                     “[a] treaty only creates law as between the States which are parties to it ;
                     in case of doubt, no rights can be deduced from it in favour of third
                     States” 5. Therefore to apply a treaty between a State party and a non‑State
                     party compromises the principles of sovereignty and equality of States.
                     The State party has not agreed to be bound by the treaty in its relation‑
                     ship with a non‑State party.
                        5. This principle seems to have been overlooked in today’s Judgment,
                     where the majority reads the 2012 Judgment as imposing a “prerequisite”
                     or a “condition”, pursuant to Article 76 (8) of UNCLOS, for the delimi‑
                     tation of extended continental shelf entitlements between Nicaragua and
                     Colombia.
                        6. In its analysis of the 2012 Judgment, paragraph 82 of today’s Judg‑
                     ment reads :
                               “[Paragraph 129 of the 2012 Judgment] must be read in the light of

                        “Nicaragua was under an obligation, pursuant to paragraph 8 of Arti‑
                        cle 76 of UNCLOS, to submit information on the limits of the conti‑
                        nental shelf it claims beyond 200 nautical miles to the CLCS. The
                        Court held, in its 2012 Judgment, that Nicaragua had to submit such
                        information as a prerequisite for the delimitation of the continental


                        7. As set out in the joint dissent, I believe that this conclusion miscon‑
                     strues the relevant paragraphs of the 2012 Judgment. The majority inter‑
                     prets the Court’s findings in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the 2012 Judgment
                     in such a way as to result in the application of law that is, in fact, inap‑
                     plicable between the two Parties.
                     

                     ment that the applicable law in the case was customary international law,
                     as Colombia was not a State party to UNCLOS. The Court then noted
                     that it considered that the definition of the continental shelf set out in
                     UNCLOS Article 76 (1) formed part of customary international law, and
                     that, it “d[id] not need to decide whether other provisions of Article 76 of
                     UNCLOS form[ed] part of customary international law”.

                        9. Yet, in paragraph 126 of the 2012 Judgment, the Court seemed to
                     forget its earlier determination that only customary international law
                     applied in the case, when it discussed its dictum in Territorial and Mari-
                     time Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea
                     (Nicaragua v. Honduras) that, “any claim of continental shelf rights





7 CIJ1093.indb 224                                                                                   15/02/17 08:28


                       Judge Donoghue, in her separate opinion to the 2012 Judgment, noted
                     that she was “troubled that the Court . . . extend[ed] the reasoning of the
                     2007 Nicaragua v. Honduras Judgment to the present case, despite the
                     fact that Colombia is not an UNCLOS State party and customary inter‑
                     national law thus governs” 6.

                        10. In paragraph 126 of the 2012 Judgment, the Court went on to
                     “recall” that “UNCLOS, according to its Preamble, is intended to estab‑
                     lish ‘a legal order for the seas and oceans which will facilitate interna‑
                     tional communication, and will promote the peaceful uses of the seas and
                     oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources’”. In the
                     same paragraph, the Court went on to state that “[g]iven the object and
                     purpose of UNCLOS, as stipulated in its Preamble, the fact that Colom‑
                     bia is not a party thereto does not relieve Nicaragua of its obligations
                     under Article 76 of that Convention”.
                        11. There is a flaw in this reasoning : Article 76 (8) of UNCLOS and
                     the Commission’s procedure in Annex 2 are obviously special, contrac‑
                     tual and confined to States parties to UNCLOS. As noted by
                     Judge ad hoc Cot in his declaration to the 2012 Judgment, Article 76 (8)
                     institutes a specific procedure that is not accessible by non‑States parties
                     to UNCLOS and it is thus “difficult” to view Article 76 (8) as an expres‑
                     sion of customary international law 7. Many other treaties reflect a similar
                     approach, whereby provisions contained in the treaty may mirror norms
                     of customary international law, but particular procedural mechanisms
                     established in respect of those provisions are peculiar to the treaty and
                     States parties to that treaty ; for example, generally, the rights set out in
                     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which persons
                     are entitled and the procedure by which persons may petition the Human
                     Rights Committee alleging a breach of those rights 8. Mark Villiger makes
                     an interesting argument in this regard. He contends that customary inter‑
                     national law rules must be “of an abstract nature, that is potentially regu‑
                     latory of an abstract number of situations rather than concerning a

                     concrete situation” 9. Villiger argues that norms of an organization

                     international law, there can be no doubt that the provision in Arti‑
                     cle 76 (8) of UNCLOS establishes a procedure that is only open to States
                     parties to UNCLOS.




                        12. Further, the importance attached by the Court in paragraph 126 of
                     the 2012 Judgment to the phrase it cites from the Preamble of UNCLOS
                     is problematic. While it is true that the Preamble to a treaty forms part of
                     the context for the purpose of the interpretation of that treaty, the Pre‑
                     amble of UNCLOS cannot, by itself, serve to override the principle that
                     the provisions of a treaty are res inter alios acta for a non‑State party
                     unless they constitute customary international law. In other words, the
                     rights and obligations under UNCLOS cannot be applied so as to benefit
                     or adversely affect a non‑State party. Therefore, obligations under
                     UNCLOS are not opposable to Nicaragua in its relationship with Colom‑
                     bia, a non‑State party, unless they form part of customary international
                     law. Judge ad hoc Mensah also made this point in his declaration to the
                     2012 Judgment 10:


                              “I do not believe or agree that the special character of UNCLOS,

                           parties to UNCLOS fundamentally different from the rights and obli‑
                           gations of States parties under other treaties. Specifically, I do not
                           subscribe to the view that the ‘object and purpose of UNCLOS, as
                           stipulated in its Preamble’, in and by themselves, impose on parties
                           to the Convention obligations vis‑à‑vis other States which have taken
                           a conscious decision not to agree to be bound by that Convention.”

                       13. It is noteworthy that the aim set out in the Preamble of UNCLOS —
                     to create a world legal order for the seas and oceans — is expressly to be
                     achieved with “due regard for the sovereignty of all States”, a phrase
                     omitted from paragraph 126 of the 2012 Judgment. The noble and laud‑

                     Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this
                     right.”).

                     or compromising the principle of State sovereignty. The principle of sov‑
                     ereignty is like a thread woven throughout the fabric of the legal order
                     established by UNCLOS. The failure of the Court to take into account in
                     its analysis the intended balance between the legal order and sovereignty
                     results in the Court exaggerating the importance of the Preamble.


                        14. Delimitation of the continental shelf of a State party to UNCLOS
                     and a non‑State party to UNCLOS should be carried out on the basis of:
                     (i) customary international law, which principally means, by virtue of
                     Article 83 of UNCLOS, an obligation to effect the delimitation “in order
                     to achieve an equitable solution”, and also, that the definition contained

                     parties may agree to apply, for example, significantly, they could agree to
                     apply the provisions of Articles 76 (2)‑(7) (in relation to which there is no
                     general agreement that they form part of customary international law).
                     Delimitation of the continental shelf between States that are not parties
                     to UNCLOS should be carried out on the basis of: (i) customary interna‑
                     tional law ; and (ii) such other rules as the Parties may agree to apply.

                       15. The majority’s decision today has interpreted the 2012 Judgment
                     as deciding that the Court could not “uphold” Nicaragua’s claim in 2012
                     because Article 76 (8) of UNCLOS created a “condition” that Nicaragua

                     shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. In paragraphs 86 and 87 of today’s Judg‑
                     ment, the majority finds that as “Nicaragua states that on 24 June 2013 it
                     provided the CLCS with ‘final’ information”, the majority “accordingly
                     considers that the condition imposed by it in its 2012 Judgment in order
                     for it to be able to examine the claim of Nicaragua contained in the final
                     submission I (3) has been fulfilled in the present case”.

                        16. The disjointed logic of this interpretation is fully discussed in the
                     joint dissent (see Section V of the joint dissent). Further, as discussed
                     therein, why would the Court, in the 2012 Judgment, have explicitly
                     determined that the law applicable between the parties was customary
                     international law, and then, within the same section of reasoning, over‑
                     ride this principle by applying as between the parties obligations under a

                        17. It may be argued that the task before the Court today is simply to
                     determine what the Court said in the 2012 Judgment in order to decide
                     whether the question before it is res judicata, and not to consider the cor‑

                     Yet, in the circumstances of this case, the majority chooses the wrong
                     interpretation, and it is not in a position to shrug off its responsibility for
                     a conclusion that contravenes a fundamental principle of the law of trea‑
                     ties by saying that it is merely reciting what the 2012 Judgment actually
                     said.


                        18. The result of this strange application of Article 76 (8) of UNCLOS

                     view, is akin to a benefit under UNCLOS, since the provision, which does
                     not mirror a rule of customary international law, has been enforced
                     against Nicaragua in its relations with Colombia. This raises questions
                     about the compatibility of the Court’s approach with the régime envis‑
                     aged by Articles 34‑36 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
