  3. Paragraph 39 of the Judgment refers to Nicaragua’s Note of
19 March 1912. However, the Court only recalls that it “challenged the




validity and binding character of the Arbitral Award”, not mentioning
the statements quoted above, even though they demonstrate Nicaragua’s
opinion that the 1906 Arbitral Award had established “the frontier line
which should separate the jurisdiction of the two countries in the ter-
ritorial sea”.
   4. I agree with Nicaragua’s Note of 1912 acknowledging that the 1906
Arbitral Award determined the sovereignty of the disputed mainland and
insular territories, as well as the continental and insular territorial waters
appertaining to Honduras and Nicaragua. However, I cannot share
Nicaragua’s allegation that the decision of the King of Spain was null
and void because of its “omissions, contradictions and obscurities”.
Nicaragua presented this contention to the Court, but it was not upheld
in its Judgment of 18 November 1960, which is res judicata (Arbitral
Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v.
Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 205-217).

  5. For these reasons, I voted in favour of paragraph 321 (1) and
against paragraph 321 (2), paragraph 321 (3) and paragraph 321 (4) of
the Judgment.
