  The Court,
  composed as above,
  after deliberation,
  delivers the following Judgment :
   1. By an Application ﬁled in the Registry of the Court on 25 February 2014,
the Republic of Costa Rica (hereinafter “Costa Rica”) instituted proceedings
against the Republic of Nicaragua (hereinafter “Nicaragua”) with regard to a
dispute concerning the “establishment of single maritime boundaries between
the two States in the Caribbean Sea and the Paciﬁc Ocean, respectively, delimit-
ing all the maritime areas appertaining to each of them, in accordance with the
applicable rules and principles of international law” (hereinafter the “case con-
cerning Maritime Delimitation”).


146     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   2. In its Application, Costa Rica seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court
on the declaration it made on 20 February 1973 under Article 36, paragraph 2,
of the Statute of the Court, as well as on the declaration which Nicaragua made
on 24 September 1929 (and amended on 23 October 2001) under Article 36 of
the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and which is deemed,
pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the present Court, for the
period which it still has to run, to be acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction
of this Court. Costa Rica further invokes as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction
Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Paciﬁc Settlement adopted at Bogotá
on 30 April 1948 (hereinafter the “Pact of Bogotá”).
   3. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Registrar
communicated a signed copy of the Application forthwith to the Government of
Nicaragua; and, under paragraph 3 of that Article, all States entitled to appear
before the Court were notiﬁed of the ﬁling of the Application.
   4. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of its Rules,
the Registrar addressed to States parties to the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (hereinafter “UNCLOS”) the
notiﬁcations provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute. The Regis-
trar also addressed the notiﬁcation provided for in Article 43, paragraph 2, of
the Rules of Court to the European Union, which is also party to the said
Convention, asking whether it intended to submit any observations under that
provision.
   5. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
either Party, each of them availed itself of its right under Article 31, paragraph 3,
of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc in the case. Costa Rica chose
Mr. Bruno Simma and Nicaragua chose Mr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh.

   6. By an Order dated 1 April 2014, the Court ﬁxed 3 February 2015 and
8 December 2015 as the respective time-limits for the ﬁling of a Memorial by
Costa Rica and a Counter-Memorial by Nicaragua. The Memorial and the
Counter-Memorial were ﬁled within the time-limits thus ﬁxed.
   7. By letter dated 3 February 2015 and received in the Registry on 5 Febru-
ary 2015, the Government of the Republic of Colombia, referring to Article 53,
paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, made a request to be furnished with copies
of the pleadings and documents annexed in the case. After consulting the Parties
in accordance with that same provision, the President of the Court decided to
grant that request. By letters dated 30 March 2015, the Registrar duly commu-
nicated that decision to the Government of Colombia and to the Parties.
   By letter dated 5 August 2015, received in the Registry on 7 August 2015, the
Government of the Republic of Panama, referring to Article 53, paragraph 1, of
the Rules of Court, in turn made a request to be furnished with copies of the
pleadings and documents annexed in the case. After consulting the Parties in
accordance with that same provision, the President of the Court decided to
grant that request. By letters dated 26 August 2015, the Registrar duly commu-
nicated that decision to the Government of Panama and to the Parties.
   8. At a meeting held by the President with the representatives of the Parties
on 28 January 2016, the Parties agreed that it was not necessary to ﬁle a Reply
and a Rejoinder.
   9. By letters dated 26 February 2016, the Registrar informed the Parties that
the Court, in accordance with Article 54, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court,
had ﬁxed 5 December 2016 as the date for the opening of the oral proceedings
in the case.


147     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   10. By letters dated 13 April 2016, the Registrar informed the Parties, pursu-
ant to Article 67, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, that the Court was consid-
ering arranging for an expert opinion entrusted to one or several experts.
The experts would be asked to collect, by conducting a site visit, all the factual
elements capable of allowing for the determination of the starting-point of
the maritime boundary between the Parties in the Caribbean Sea, in particular
elements relating to the state of the coast between the point located on the right
bank of the San Juan River at its mouth and the land point closest to
Punta de Castilla, as those two points could be identiﬁed at the time of that
visit. The Parties were further informed that the Court had ﬁxed 3 May 2016 as
the time-limit within which they might present their positions with respect to
any such appointment, in particular their views on the subject of the expert
opinion, the number and mode of appointment of the experts, and the proce-
dure to be followed. They were also advised that any comments that either Party
might wish to make on the reply of the other Party should be furnished by
13 May 2016 at the latest.
   11. By letter dated 3 May 2016, Costa Rica welcomed the exercise by the Court
of its power to arrange for an expert opinion. It suggested that the Court consider
appointing a committee of three experts, composed of geographers who were inde-
pendent of both Parties, and that the Parties should have the opportunity to make
observations on the choice of these experts. Costa Rica proposed that a number of
matters be covered in the terms of reference for the experts. It also expressed the
wish that the Parties should have the opportunity to provide comments on the
experts’ report in writing before the beginning of the oral proceedings, and that any
comments that either Party might wish to make on the comments of the other
Party should also be provided in writing in advance of the oral proceedings.
Finally, Costa Rica made certain proposals regarding logistical matters.
   12. By letter of the same date, Nicaragua, for its part, stated that it consid-
ered that there was no need to carry out a site visit, asserting that, since the
location of the starting-point of the land boundary on the Caribbean coast had
been established by various instruments, the determination of the starting-point
of the maritime boundary between the Parties was a technical and legal task that
did not require a site visit. Nicaragua nonetheless added that if, having taken
into account its position, the Court were to consider that a site visit was neces-
sary, Nicaragua would be ready to express in due time its position with respect
to the terms of reference for the expert(s) and their appointment, and to assist
them to the fullest possible extent.
   13. By letters of 13 May 2016, each of the Parties reiterated its position.
   14. By Order dated 31 May 2016, the Court decided that an expert opinion
would be arranged, in accordance with Articles 48 and 50 of its Statute, to
inform the Court as to the state of the coast between the point suggested by
Costa Rica and the point suggested by Nicaragua in their pleadings as the
starting-point of the maritime boundary in the Caribbean Sea. The Order stated,
inter alia, that the expert opinion would be entrusted to two independent
experts appointed by Order of the President of the Court after hearing the
Parties, and that these experts would make the following declaration:
         “I solemnly declare, upon my honour and conscience, that I will perform
      my duties as expert honourably and faithfully, impartially and conscien-
      tiously, and will refrain from divulging or using, outside the Court, any
      documents or information of a conﬁdential character which may come to
      my knowledge in the course of the performance of my task.”



148     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   15. By letters dated 2 June 2016, the Registrar informed the Parties of the
Court’s decision. He also indicated that the Court had identiﬁed two potential
experts to prepare the expert opinion it had decided to obtain, namely
Mr. Eric Fouache and Mr. Francisco Gutiérrez, whose curricula vitae were
enclosed with the said letters. The Parties were invited to communicate to the
Court any observations they might have on the two experts by 10 June 2016, at
the latest.
   16. By letter dated 10 June 2016, Costa Rica stated that it had no objection
to the experts selected by the Court and that it stood ready to provide any neces-
sary assistance to the expert mission; by letter of the same date, Nicaragua,
without submitting any speciﬁc observations on the two experts, expressed its
full readiness to assist the Court with the organization of the mission.

   17. By an Order dated 16 June 2016, the President of the Court appointed the
following two experts: Mr. Eric Fouache, of French nationality, Professor of
Geography, Vice-Chancellor of Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi
(United Arab Emirates), senior member of the Institut universitaire de France
and President of the International Association of Geomorphologists; and
Mr. Francisco Gutiérrez, of Spanish nationality, Professor of Geology and
Geomorphology at the University of Zaragoza (Spain), former member of the
Executive Committee of the International Association of Geomorphologists.
The experts subsequently made the solemn declaration provided for in the
Order of 31 May 2016 (see paragraph 14 above).
   18. The experts informed the Court that, in their view, it would be necessary
to conduct two site visits, one in early December (rainy period with high dis-
charge of the San Juan River) and the other in March or early April (drier period
with low discharge of the San Juan River). Consequently, the Court decided to
postpone the opening of the oral proceedings until 12 June 2017. The Parties
were informed of this decision by letters from the Registrar dated 1 July 2016.
   19. Between July and November 2016, several exchanges of correspondence
took place between the experts, the Registrar and the Parties concerning the
organization of the site visits. In addition, on 1 September 2016, the Registrar
met with the representatives of the Parties to discuss the practical aspects of the
visits. By letters dated 20 October 2016, the Parties communicated to the Court
several documents requested by the experts (photographs, satellite images,
maps, etc.); these documents were transmitted to them forthwith.
   20. By letter dated 28 November 2016, Costa Rica requested the postpone-
ment of the experts’ ﬁrst site visit, which had been scheduled to take place from
4 to 9 December 2016, in light of the damage caused by Hurricane Otto, which
shortly beforehand had hit the region to be inspected. By letter dated 29 Novem-
ber 2016, Nicaragua indicated its preference for the mission to proceed as
planned. By letter dated 30 November 2016, Costa Rica reiterated its request,
while setting out the arrangements that could be provided if the Court were to
decide to maintain the dates of the visit scheduled for early December. The
experts were consulted and they expressed their reluctance to postpone the
mission, explaining in particular that visiting at that time would allow them to
have a better grasp of the impact of high-magnitude hydrological events on the
conﬁguration of the coast and the San Juan River. The President of the Court
having considered the matter, it was decided to maintain the dates of the site
visit as planned.
   21. The experts’ ﬁrst site visit accordingly took place from 4 to 9 December
2016. The experts were accompanied by two staﬀ members of the Registry who


149     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

constituted the secretariat of the mission, and by a delegation from each Party.
During the visit, the Parties exchanged documents, photographs and video
recordings and provided them to the experts. They subsequently indicated that
they considered that such new materials exchanged during the visits should be
included in the case ﬁle, unless otherwise stated.
   22. On 16 January 2017, Costa Rica instituted proceedings against Nicara-
gua in a dispute concerning “the precise location of the land boundary separat-
ing the Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from Isla Portillos” and
“the . . . establishment of a military camp by Nicaragua on the beach of
Isla Portillos” (hereinafter “the case concerning the Northern Part of Isla
Portillos”).
   Costa Rica seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on the aforemen-
tioned declarations (see paragraph 2 above) and on Article XXXI of the Pact of
Bogotá.
   23. In its Application, Costa Rica requested that the Court join the new pro-
ceedings with the proceedings in the case concerning Maritime Delimitation,
pursuant to Article 47 of the Rules of Court.
   24. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Registrar
communicated a signed copy of the said Application forthwith to the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua; under paragraph 3 of that Article, all States entitled to
appear before the Court were notiﬁed of the ﬁling of the Application.
   25. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
either Party, each of them availed itself of its right under Article 31, para-
graph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc in the case concerning the
Northern Part of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica chose Mr. Bruno Simma and Nicara-
gua chose Mr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh.
   26. On 25 January 2017, the Registrar held a meeting with the representatives
of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in connection with the case concerning Maritime
Delimitation to discuss arrangements for the second site visit. During that meet-
ing, it was decided that the said visit would take place from 12 to 17 March 2017.
   27. On 26 January 2017, the President held a meeting with the representatives
of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, who were invited to convey the views of their
Governments on the question of the time-limits for the ﬁling of pleadings in the
case concerning the Northern Part of Isla Portillos and on whether it would be
appropriate to join the proceedings in that case with those in the case concern-
ing Maritime Delimitation.
   28. By Order dated 2 February 2017, the Court ﬁxed 2 March 2017 and
18 April 2017 as the respective time-limits for the ﬁling of a Memorial by
Costa Rica and a Counter-Memorial by Nicaragua in the case concerning the
Northern Part of Isla Portillos. The Memorial and the Counter-Memorial were
ﬁled within the time-limits thus prescribed.
   29. By its Order dated 2 February 2017, the Court also decided to join the
proceedings in the case concerning Maritime Delimitation and the case concern-
ing the Northern Part of Isla Portillos.
   30. By letters dated 3 February 2017, the Registrar informed the Parties that
the Court had decided that the hearings in the joined cases would open on
3 July 2017.
   31. The experts’ second site visit took place from 12 to 17 March 2017.
The experts were once again accompanied by two staﬀ members of the Registry
and a delegation from each Party. During the visit, the Parties exchanged
documents, photographs and video recordings and provided them to the
experts.


150     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   32. By letter dated 1 May 2017, the Registrar communicated to the Parties
copies of the report ﬁled by the experts appointed in the case concerning Mari-
time Delimitation. Each of the Parties was given until 1 June 2017 to submit any
written observations that they might wish to make on the said report.
   33. On 16 May 2017, the President held a meeting with the representatives of
the Parties to discuss the organization of the oral proceedings in the joined
cases; the Parties agreed that they did not consider it necessary to put any ques-
tions to the experts at the hearings. By letters dated 29 May 2017, the Registrar
informed the Parties of the schedule for the oral proceedings, as adopted by the
Court.
   34. Under cover of a letter dated 1 June 2017, Costa Rica communicated to
the Court the written observations of its Government on the experts’ report. By
letter of the same date, Nicaragua indicated that it had no written observations
to make at that stage. Costa Rica’s observations were communicated to the
experts, who responded in writing on 8 June 2017; that response was transmit-
ted to the Parties forthwith.
   35. By letters dated 12 June 2017, the Registrar communicated to the experts
the text of a question from a Member of the Court, and notiﬁed the Parties of
that question. The experts replied on 15 June 2017; their reply was transmitted
to the Parties.
   36. By letters dated 28 June 2017, the Registrar communicated to the Parties
the text of a question from the Court addressed to them both. The Parties were
invited to present their responses during the ﬁrst round of oral argument.

                                        *
  37. In accordance with Article 53, paragraph 2, of its Rules, the Court
decided, after consulting the Parties, that copies of the pleadings and documents
annexed, as well as the experts’ report and certain related documents, would be
made accessible to the public on the opening of the oral proceedings.

   38. Public hearings were held from Monday 3 July to Thursday 13 July 2017
in the joined proceedings. The Court heard the oral arguments and replies of:
  For Costa Rica: H.E. Mr. Edgar Ugalde Alvarez,
                  H.E. Mr. Sergio Ugalde,
                  Ms Kate Parlett,

151      maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

  39. In its Application in the case concerning Maritime Delimitation, Costa
Rica made the following requests:
         “Accordingly, the Court is asked to determine the complete course of a
      single maritime boundary between all the maritime areas appertaining,
      respectively, to Costa Rica and to Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea and in
      the Paciﬁc Ocean, on the basis of international law.
         Costa Rica further requests the Court to determine the precise geograph-
      ical co-ordinates of the single maritime boundaries in the Caribbean Sea
      and in the Paciﬁc Ocean.”
  40. In the course of the written proceedings in the case concerning Maritime
Delimitation, the following submissions were presented by the Parties :
On behalf of the Government of Costa Rica,
in the Memorial :
         “Costa Rica respectfully requests the Court to determine the complete
      course of single maritime boundaries between all the maritime areas apper-
      taining, respectively, to Costa Rica and to Nicaragua in the Paciﬁc Ocean
      and in the Caribbean Sea, on the basis of international law.

         Costa Rica further requests the Court to determine the precise geograph-
      ical co-ordinates of the single maritime boundaries in the Paciﬁc Ocean and
      in the Caribbean Sea, as follows :
      1. to delimit the maritime areas of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the

   42. In its Application ﬁled in the case concerning the Northern Part of
Isla Portillos, Costa Rica made the following requests:
        “Accordingly, the Court is asked :
      (a) To determine the precise location of the land boundary separating both
          ends of the Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from Isla Por-
          tillos, and in doing so to determine that the only Nicaraguan territory
          existing today in the area of Isla Portillos is limited to the enclave con-
          sisting of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the sandbar separat-
          ing the lagoon from the Caribbean Sea, insofar as this sandbar remains
          above water at all times and thus this enclave is capable of constituting
          territory appertaining to a State. Consequently, that the land boundary
          runs today from the north-eastern corner of the lagoon by the shortest
          line to the Caribbean Sea and from the north-western corner of the
          lagoon by the shortest line to the Caribbean Sea.

      (b) To adjudge and declare that, by establishing and maintaining a new
          military camp on the beach of Isla Portillos, Nicaragua has violated
          the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Costa Rica, and is in breach
          of the Judgment of the Court of 16 December 2015 in the Certain
          Activities case. Consequently, Costa Rica further requests the
          Court to declare that Nicaragua must withdraw its military camp
          situated in Costa Rican territory and fully comply with the Court’s 2015
          Judgment. Costa Rica reserves it[s] rights to seek any further remedies


157     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

          with respect to any damage that Nicaragua has or may cause to its
          territory.”
   43. In the course of the written proceedings in the case concerning the North-
ern Part of Isla Portillos, the following submissions were presented by the
Parties:
On behalf of the Government of Costa Rica,
in the Memorial :
        “Costa Rica respectfully requests the Court :
      (a) To determine the precise location of the land boundary separating both
          ends of the Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from Isla Por-
          tillos, and in doing so to determine that the only Nicaraguan territory

      (b) To adjudge and declare that, by establishing and maintaining a new
          military camp on the beach of Isla Portillos, Nicaragua has violated
          the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Costa Rica, and is in breach
          of the Judgment of the Court of 16 December 2015 in the Certain

          declare that Nicaragua must withdraw its military camp situated in
          Costa Rican territory and fully comply with the Court’s 2015 Judgment.
          Costa Rica reserves it[s] rights to seek any further remedies with respect
          to any damage that Nicaragua has or may cause to its territory.”

On behalf of the Government of Nicaragua,
in the Counter-Memorial :
         “For the reasons exposed in the present Counter-Memorial, the Republic
      of Nicaragua respectfully requests the Court to adjudge and declare that :
      1. the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies between the
          Harbor Head Lagoon and the mouth of the San Juan River constitutes
          Nicaraguan territory ;
      2. the military camp set up by Nicaragua is located on Nicaraguan terri-
          tory and consequently ;
      3. the requests and submissions of the Republic of Costa Rica are rejected
          in their entirety.”
  44. At the oral proceedings in the joined cases, the following submissions
were presented by the Parties with respect to the case concerning the Northern
Part of Isla Portillos:
On behalf of the Government of Costa Rica,
at the hearing of 10 July 2017 :



158     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

        “Costa Rica respectfully requests the Court :
      1. (a) to adjudge and declare that Nicaragua’s submission that the
              stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies between the
              Harbor Head Lagoon and the mouth of the San Juan River con-
              stitutes Nicaraguan territory is inadmissible, on the basis that the
              issue has already been settled by the Judgment of the Court dated
              16 December 2015 in the Certain Activities case ;
         (b) to reject all other submissions made by Nicaragua ;
      2. (a) to determine the precise location of the land boundary separating
              both ends of the Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from
              Isla Portillos, and in doing so to determine that the only Nicara-
              guan territory existing today in the area of Isla Portillos is limited
              to the enclave consisting of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon
              and the sandbar separating the lagoon from the Caribbean Sea,
              in so far as this sandbar remains above water at all times and thus
              this enclave is capable of constituting territory appertaining to a
              State. Consequently, that the land boundary runs today from the
              north-eastern corner of the lagoon by the shortest line to the Car-
              ibbean Sea and from the north-western corner of the lagoon by
              the shortest line to the Caribbean Sea ;

          (b) to adjudge and declare that, by establishing and maintaining a new
              military camp on the beach of Isla Portillos, Nicaragua has vio-
              lated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Costa Rica, and is
              in breach of the Judgment of the Court of 16 December 2015 in
              the Certain Activities case. Consequently, Costa Rica further
              requests the Court to declare that Nicaragua must withdraw its
              military camp situated in Costa Rican territory and fully comply
              with the Court’s 2015 Judgment.”
On behalf of the Government of Nicaragua,
at the hearing of 13 July 2017 :
        “Nicaragua respectfully requests from the Court to :
      Adjudge and declare that :
      (a) the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies between the
          Harbor Head Lagoon and the mouth of the San Juan River constitutes
          Nicaraguan territory ;

                        I. Jurisdiction of the Court

  45. In both of the cases under consideration, Costa Rica invokes, as
bases of jurisdiction, the declarations by which Costa Rica and Nicara-


159    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

gua have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under para-
graphs 2 and 5, respectively, of Article 36 of the Statute, as well as
Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá (see paragraphs 2 and 22 above).
Nicaragua does not contest the Court’s jurisdiction to entertain Costa
Rica’s claims.
   46. The Court ﬁnds that it has jurisdiction over the disputes in the
joined cases.


                       II. General Background

                              A. Geography
   47. Costa Rica and Nicaragua are situated in Central America, sharing
a land boundary that spans the Central American isthmus from the
Caribbean Sea to the Paciﬁc Ocean. Nicaragua lies to the north of that
boundary and Costa Rica to the south. Nicaragua has a border with
Honduras in the north, while Costa Rica shares a border with Panama in
the south.
   48. Isla Portillos, the northern part of which is the subject of the land
boundary dispute, is an area (approximately 17 sq km) bounded to the
west by the San Juan River and to the north by the Caribbean Sea. At the
north-western extremity of Isla Portillos, a sandspit of variable length
deﬂects the ﬁnal course of the San Juan River, displacing its mouth
towards the west. On the coast of Isla Portillos, approximately 3.6 km
east of the mouth of the San Juan River, is a lagoon called
Laguna Los Portillos by Costa Rica and Harbor Head Lagoon by Nica-
ragua. This lagoon is at present separated from the Caribbean Sea by a
sandbar.
   49. The Caribbean Sea lies in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean.
It is partially enclosed to the north and east by the Caribbean islands, and
bounded to the south and west by South and Central America, respec-
tively. In the Caribbean Sea oﬀ the coast of Nicaragua there are several
islands and cays, the most prominent of which are the Corn Islands,
located approximately 26 nautical miles oﬀ its coast, and having an area,
respectively, of 9.6 sq km (Great Corn Island) and 3 sq km (Little Corn
Island). The Corn Islands have a population of approximately 7,400 inhab-
itants. Other small features lying oﬀ the Nicaraguan coast include Pax-
aro Bovo, the Palmenta Cays, Cayos de Perlas, Tyra Rock, Man of War
Cays, Ned Thomas Cay, Miskitos Cays, Muerto Cay and Edinburgh Reef.
Costa Rica has two small islands, Isla Pájaros and Isla Uvita, less than
half a nautical mile oﬀ its coast near the city of Limón.



  50. On the Paciﬁc side, the coast of Nicaragua is relatively straight and
generally follows a north-west to south-east direction. The Costa Rican


160    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

coast is more sinuous and includes the peninsulas of Santa Elena (near
the land boundary terminus), Nicoya and Osa.


                           B. Historical Context
   51. As the Court noted in its Judgment of 16 December 2015 in the
cases concerning Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border
Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) (I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), p. 665, herein-
after the “2015 Judgment” (in the “Certain Activities case”)), the present
disputes between the Parties are set within a historical context dating
back to the 1850s. Following hostilities between the two States in 1857,
the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed, on 15 April 1858,
a Treaty of Limits, which was ratiﬁed by Costa Rica on 16 April 1858
and by Nicaragua on 26 April 1858 (Consolidated Treaty Series, Vol. 118,
p. 439, hereinafter the “1858 Treaty”). The 1858 Treaty ﬁxed the course
of the land boundary between Costa Rica and Nicaragua from
the Paciﬁc Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. According to Article II of the
Treaty, part of the boundary between the two States runs along the
right (Costa Rican) bank of the San Juan River from a point three
English miles below Castillo Viejo, a small town in Nicaragua, to “the
end of Punta de Castilla, at the mouth of the San Juan” on the Caribbean
coast.
   52. Following challenges by Nicaragua on various occasions to the valid-
ity of the 1858 Treaty, Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed another instrument
on 24 December 1886, whereby the two States agreed to submit the question
of the validity of the 1858 Treaty to the President of the United States of
America, Grover Cleveland, for arbitration. In addition, the Parties agreed
that, if the 1858 Treaty were found to be valid, President Cleveland should
also decide “upon all the other points of doubtful interpretation which either
of the parties may ﬁnd in the treaty”. On 22 June 1887, Nicaragua commu-
nicated to Costa Rica 11 points of doubtful interpretation, which were sub-
sequently submitted to President Cleveland for resolution. The
Cleveland Award of 1888 conﬁrmed, in its paragraph 1, the validity of the
1858 Treaty and found, in its paragraph 3 (1), that the boundary line
between the two States on the Atlantic side “begins at the extremity of Punta
de Castilla at the mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, as they both
existed on the 15th day of April 1858”.
   53. Subsequent to the Cleveland Award, the Parties agreed in the
“Convention on border demarcation concluded between the Republic of
Costa Rica and the Republic of Nicaragua”, signed at San Salvador on
27 March 1896 (United Nations, Reports of International Arbitral Awards
(RIAA), Vol. XXVIII, p. 211), to establish two national Demarcation
Commissions, each composed of two members (Art. I). This Convention
further provided that the Commissions would include an engineer,
appointed by the President of the United States of America, who “shall
have broad powers to decide whatever kind of diﬀerences may arise in the


161    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

course of any operations and [whose] ruling shall be ﬁnal” (Art. II).
United States General Edward Porter Alexander was so appointed. Dur-
ing the demarcation process, which began in 1897 and was concluded in
1900, General Alexander rendered ﬁve Awards (RIAA, Vol. XXVIII,
pp. 215 and following for the ﬁrst four Awards).
   54. In his ﬁrst Award, dated 30 September 1897, General Alexander
determined the starting segment of the land boundary near the Carib-
bean Sea in light of geomorphological changes that had occurred
since 1858. That segment was deﬁned as starting from “the north-western
extremity of what seems to be the solid land, on the east side of Har-
bor Head Lagoon” and then running “across the bank of sand, from the
Caribbean Sea into the waters of Harbor Head Lagoon”. From there,
Alexander determined that the boundary would “follow the water’s edge
around the harbor until it reaches the river proper by the ﬁrst channel
met. Up this channel, and up the river proper, the line shall continue to
ascend as directed in the treaty.” (Ibid., p. 220.) As the Court noted in the
2015 Judgment, “what the Arbitrator considered to be the ‘ﬁrst channel’
was the branch of the Lower San Juan River which was then ﬂowing into
the Harbor Head Lagoon” (I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), p. 699, para. 73).
Following Alexander’s ﬁrst Award, the Demarcation Commissions
recorded the co-ordinates of the starting-point of the land boundary
determined by General Alexander by reference to the centre of
Plaza Victoria in old San Juan de Nicaragua (Greytown) and other points
on the ground.

   55. Since the time of the Alexander Awards and the work of the
Demarcation Commissions, the northern part of Isla Portillos has contin-
ued to undergo signiﬁcant geomorphological changes. In 2010, a dispute
arose between Costa Rica and Nicaragua with regard to certain activities
carried out by Nicaragua in that area. In its 2015 Judgment, the Court
considered the impact of some of these changes on the issue of territorial
sovereignty. The Court stated “that the territory under Costa Rica’s sov-
ereignty extends to the right bank of the Lower San Juan River as far as
its mouth in the Caribbean Sea” (I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), p. 703,
para. 92). The Court thus concluded that Costa Rica had sovereignty
over a 3 sq km area in the northern part of Isla Portillos, although noting
in its description of this area that it did “not speciﬁcally refer to the
stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies between the Har-
bor Head Lagoon, which lagoon both Parties agree is Nicaraguan, and
the mouth of the San Juan River” (ibid., pp. 696-697, paras. 69-70, and
p. 740, para. 229 (1)). The course of the land boundary on this stretch of
coast is one of the subjects of dispute between the Parties in the present
joined cases.

  56. With respect to maritime areas, a bilateral Sub-Commission on
Limits and Cartography was established by the two Parties in May 1997
to carry out preliminary technical studies regarding possible maritime


162    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

delimitations in the Paciﬁc Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. In 2002, the
Vice-Ministers for Foreign Aﬀairs of both countries instructed the bilat-
eral Sub-Commission to begin negotiations. The Sub-Commission held
ﬁve meetings between 2002 and 2005. Several technical meetings were
also held between the Costa Rican National Geographic Institute and the
Nicaraguan Institute for Territorial Studies during the same period. Fol-
lowing these initial meetings, negotiations on maritime delimitations
between the two States stalled.

          C. Delimitations already Effected in the Caribbean Sea
                          and the Pacific Ocean
   57. In the Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica concluded, on 2 February 1980,
a treaty with Panama delimiting a maritime boundary ; this treaty entered
into force on 11 February 1982. Costa Rica negotiated and signed a mar-
itime delimitation treaty with Colombia in 1977, but never ratiﬁed that
instrument. Nicaragua’s maritime boundaries with Honduras (to the
north) and Colombia (to the east) have been established by Judgments of
the Court in 2007 and 2012, respectively (Territorial and Maritime Dis-
pute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v.
Honduras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 659 ; Territorial and
Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2012 (II), p. 624). Colombia and Panama also concluded a maritime
delimitation treaty establishing their boundary in the Caribbean Sea on
20 November 1976 ; this treaty entered into force on 30 November 1977
(United Nations, Treaty Series (UNTS), Vol. 1074, p. 221).

   58. The above-mentioned treaty concluded by Costa Rica and Panama
in 1980 also delimited their maritime boundary in the Paciﬁc Ocean. For
its part, Nicaragua has not concluded any treaty establishing a maritime
boundary in the Paciﬁc Ocean.


              III. Land Boundary in the Northern Part
                          of Isla Portillos

                A. Issues concerning Territorial Sovereignty
   59. The case concerning the Land Boundary in the Northern Part of
Isla Portillos raises issues of territorial sovereignty which it is expedient to
examine ﬁrst, because of their possible implications for the maritime
delimitation in the Caribbean Sea. The Parties express divergent views on
the interpretation of the 2015 Judgment and advance opposing claims on
certain questions relating to sovereignty over the coast of the northern
part of Isla Portillos.
   60. In the operative part of the 2015 Judgment, the Court stated that
“Costa Rica has sovereignty over the ‘disputed territory’, as deﬁned by


163   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





164     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

the Court in paragraphs 69-70 of the . . . Judgment”. These paragraphs
read as follows:
         “69. Since it is uncontested that Nicaragua conducted certain
      activities in the disputed territory, it is necessary, in order to establish
      whether there was a breach of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty, to
      determine which State has sovereignty over that territory. The ‘dis-
      puted territory’ was deﬁned by the Court in its Order of 8 March 2011
      on provisional measures as ‘the northern part of Isla Portillos, that is
      to say, the area of wetland of some 3 square kilometres between the
      right bank of the disputed caño, the right bank of the San Juan River
      up to its mouth at the Caribbean Sea and the Harbor Head Lagoon’
      (I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 19, para. 55). The caño referred to is the
      one which was dredged by Nicaragua in 2010. Nicaragua did not con-
      test this deﬁnition of the ‘disputed territory’, while Costa Rica
      expressly endorsed it in its ﬁnal submissions (para. 2 (a)). The Court
      will maintain the deﬁnition of ‘disputed territory’ given in the
      2011 Order. It recalls that its Order of 22 November 2013 indicating
      provisional measures speciﬁed that a Nicaraguan military encamp-
      ment ‘located on the beach and close to the line of vegetation’ near
      one of the caños dredged in 2013 was ‘situated in the disputed territory
      as deﬁned by the Court in its Order of 8 March 2011’ (I.C.J. Reports
      2013, p. 365, para. 46).


         70. The above deﬁnition of the ‘disputed territory’ does not specif-
      ically refer to the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which
      lies between the Harbor Head Lagoon, which lagoon both Parties
      agree is Nicaraguan, and the mouth of the San Juan River. In their
      oral arguments the Parties expressed diﬀerent views on this issue.
      However, they did not address the question of the precise location of
      the mouth of the river nor did they provide detailed information con-
      cerning the coast. Neither Party requested the Court to deﬁne the
      boundary more precisely with regard to this coast. Accordingly, the
      Court will refrain from doing so.” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2015
      (II), pp. 696-697.)
   61. According to Costa Rica’s reading of that Judgment, “the beach of
Isla Portillos belongs to Costa Rica. This decision possesses the force of
res judicata, as reﬂected in Articles 59 and 60 of the Court’s Statute.”
Therefore, “[o]nly the precise location of the boundary at each end of the
sandbar of Harbor Head Lagoon remains open”. Costa Rica maintains
that the purpose behind the ﬁrst sentence of paragraph 70 of the
2015 Judgment was to leave open the question whether there was a mari-
time feature beyond the beach of Isla Portillos, and not to exclude that
beach from the disputed territory. According to Costa Rica, “the beach
of Isla Portillos was expressly included within the disputed territory” and
was thus declared to be Costa Rican territory.


165     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

  62. In Costa Rica’s view, the mainland boundary runs, consistent with
Article II of the 1858 Treaty, along the right bank of the Lower San Juan
River all the way to its mouth in the Caribbean Sea and the land bound-
ary terminus is located on the right bank of the San Juan River at its
mouth. According to Costa Rica, the only Nicaraguan territory in the
area of Isla Portillos is the enclave of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon
and the sandbar separating the lagoon from the Caribbean Sea, “for so
long as it is territory capable of appertaining to a State”.

    63. Nicaragua argues that, in its 2015 Judgment, “the Court did
not . . . determine the precise location of the boundary at any point
between the north-western end of Harbor Head Lagoon and the mouth
of the San Juan River” (emphasis in the original). Nicaragua maintains
that the Court in that Judgment refrained from deﬁning the boundary
with regard to the coast between the mouth of the San Juan River and
Harbor Head Lagoon and “did not ﬁx the limits of the ‘territory in dis-
pute’”. Nicaragua contends that the Certain Activities case was one
regarding State responsibility for wrongful acts and was not concerned
with delimitation. According to Nicaragua, that case did not require the
Court to take a position regarding sovereignty over the relevant stretch of
coast or its precise limits. Therefore, in Nicaragua’s view, sovereignty
over the beach of Isla Portillos remains to be determined.
    64. In this respect, Nicaragua argues that the 1858 Treaty and the subse-
quent Cleveland and Alexander Awards indicate that the starting-point of
the boundary is located at a ﬁxed point at Punta de Castilla, and not at the
mouth of the San Juan River. It emphasizes that President Cleveland ﬁxed
the starting-point of the land boundary “at the extremity of Punta de Cas-
tilla at the mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, as they both existed
on the 15th day of April 1858” (emphasis added by Nicaragua). According
to Nicaragua, the Cleveland Award, which is still binding on the Parties,
made clear that the starting-point was a “fixed unmovable point” the loca-
tion of which would not shift following changes in the ﬂow of the River
(emphasis of Nicaragua). Nicaragua maintains that General Alexander’s
ﬁrst Award went “to great lengths to ﬁnd where Punta de Castilla was
located, because that was the ﬁxed starting point for the border”.
    65. In its Counter-Memorial, Nicaragua argued that the channel of the
San Juan River which ﬂowed into Harbor Head Lagoon at the time of
General Alexander’s ﬁrst Award, and was identiﬁed in the Award as
marking the land boundary, still ﬂows into the lagoon. According to Nica-
ragua, the beach of Isla Portillos and the sandbar between Harbor Head
Lagoon and the Caribbean Sea consist of the remnants of the barrier that
used to separate the lagoon from the Caribbean Sea so that they should be
considered an independent feature separated from the mainland. In Nica-
ragua’s view, the land boundary between the Parties runs as follows:
      “the land boundary starts at the north-east corner of the sandbar
      separating Harbor Head Lagoon from the Caribbean Sea, cuts that


166     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

      sandbar and follows the water’s edge around the lagoon until it meets
      the channel connecting Harbor Head Lagoon to the lower San Juan.
      The boundary then follows the contour of Isla Portillos up to the
      lower San Juan”.
Consequently, it submits that the stretch of coast between Harbor Head
Lagoon and the mouth of the San Juan River is under Nicaraguan sover-
eignty. Nicaragua argued in its oral pleadings that if the Court were to
accept Costa Rica’s position and decide that the coast is not under Nica-
raguan sovereignty, “the whole structure carefully created by the
1858 Treaty and the Awards would be dismantled and the Nicaragua/
Costa Rica border would have to be repeatedly under review”.
   66. Nicaragua acknowledged at the hearings that the channel linking
Harbor Head Lagoon to the San Juan River had “partially disappeared”
in recent years. It maintained that the “rules governing the eﬀects of
accretion and erosion” do not apply to the present situation and that
accordingly “the boundary should continue to be deﬁned by the approxi-
mate location of the former channel, such that the boundary that now
separates the beach from the wetland behind it corresponds to the line of
vegetation”.
   67. In its ﬁnal submissions, Costa Rica speciﬁcally requests the Court

      “to adjudge and declare that Nicaragua’s submission that the stretch
      of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies between Harbor Head
      Lagoon and the mouth of the San Juan River constitutes Nicaraguan
      territory is inadmissible, on the basis that the issue has already been
      settled by the Judgment of the Court dated 16 December 2015 in the
      Certain Activities case”.

                                      *
   68. The Court has previously had the occasion to emphasize that “the
principle of res judicata, as reﬂected in Articles 59 and 60 of its Statute, is
a general principle of law which protects, at the same time, the judicial
function of a court or tribunal and the parties to a case which has led to
a judgment that is ﬁnal and without appeal” (Question of the Delimitation
of the Continental Shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 Nau-
tical Miles from the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2016 (I), p. 125, para. 58 and
authorities cited therein). However, for res judicata to apply in a given
case, the Court “must determine whether and to what extent the ﬁrst
claim has already been deﬁnitively settled” (ibid., p. 126, para. 59), for
“[i]f a matter has not in fact been determined, expressly or by necessary
implication, then no force of res judicata attaches to it” (ibid., para. 60,
quoting Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Monte-
negro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), p. 95, para. 126).


167     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   69. The Court recalls that the operative part of its 2015 Judgment
stated that “Costa Rica has sovereignty over the ‘disputed territory’, as
deﬁned . . . in paragraphs 69-70” of that Judgment (I.C.J. Reports
2015 (II), p. 740, para. 229). The term “disputed territory” was described
in those paragraphs as including
      “the northern part of Isla Portillos, that is to say, the area of wetland
      of some 3 square kilometres between the right bank of the disputed
      caño, the right bank of the San Juan River up to its mouth at
      the Caribbean Sea and the Harbor Head Lagoon” (ibid., p. 697,
      para. 69).
The Court noted, however, that
      “[t]he above deﬁnition of the ‘disputed territory’ does not speciﬁcally
      refer to the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea which lies
      between the Harbor Head Lagoon, which lagoon both Parties agree
      is Nicaraguan, and the mouth of the San Juan River” (ibid., para. 70).
The Court further noted that the Parties
      “did not address the question of the precise location of the mouth of
      the river nor did they provide detailed information concerning the
      coast. Neither Party requested the Court to deﬁne the boundary more
      precisely with regard to this coast. Accordingly, the Court will refrain
      from doing so.” (Ibid.)
These passages indicate that no decision was taken by the Court in its
2015 Judgment on the question of sovereignty concerning the coast of the
northern part of Isla Portillos, since this question had been expressly
excluded. This means that it is not possible for the issue of sovereignty
over that part of the coast to be res judicata. Therefore, the Court cannot
declare inadmissible Nicaragua’s claim concerning sovereignty over that
stretch of coast of Isla Portillos.
   70. In its 2015 Judgment, the Court interpreted the 1858 Treaty as pro-
viding that “the territory under Costa Rica’s sovereignty extends to the
right bank of the Lower San Juan River as far as its mouth in the Carib-
bean Sea” (ibid., p. 703, para. 92). However, the absence of “detailed
information”, which had been observed in the 2015 Judgment, had left
the geographical situation of the area in question somewhat unclear with
regard to the conﬁguration of the coast of Isla Portillos, in particular
regarding the existence of maritime features oﬀ the coast and the presence
of a channel separating the wetland from the coast.
   71. The assessment made by the Court-appointed experts, which was
not challenged by the Parties, dispels all uncertainty about the present
conﬁguration of the coast and the existence of a channel linking the San
Juan River with Harbor Head Lagoon. The experts ascertained that “[o]ﬀ
the coastline, there are no features above water even at low tide” and
that, west of Harbor Head Lagoon, “the coast is made up of a broad
sandy beach with discontinuous and coast-parallel enclosed lagoons in


168     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

the backshore”, while “[i]n the westernmost portion, close to the mouth
of the San Juan River, there are no lagoons with free-standing water in
the backshore”. Signiﬁcantly, the experts observed that there is no longer
any water channel connecting the San Juan River with Harbor Head
Lagoon. Since there is no channel, there cannot be a boundary running
along it. Nicaragua’s contention that “the boundary should continue to
be deﬁned by the approximate location of the former channel” linking the
river with Harbor Head Lagoon ignores the fact that the channel in ques-
tion, as it existed at the time of the Alexander Awards, was running well
north of the present beach and has been submerged by the sea, as the
Court-appointed experts noted, explaining that “such . . . continuous
channel has disappeared due to coastal recession”. In light of these ﬁnd-
ings, the Court determines that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the whole
of Isla Portillos up to where the river reaches the Caribbean Sea. It fol-
lows from the 2015 Judgment and from the foregoing that the starting-
point of the land boundary is the point at which the right bank of the San
Juan River reaches the low-water mark of the coast of the Caribbean Sea.
That point is currently located at the end of the sandspit constituting the
right bank of the San Juan River at its mouth.

  72. However, as stated in the 2015 Judgment, the Parties agree that
Nicaragua has sovereignty over Harbor Head Lagoon (I.C.J. Reports
2015 (II), p. 697, para. 70). Costa Rica requests the Court to

      “determine the precise location of the land boundary separating both
      ends of the Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from Isla Por-
      tillos, and in doing so to determine that the only Nicaraguan territory
      existing today in the area of Isla Portillos is limited to the enclave
      consisting of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the sandbar
      separating the lagoon from the Caribbean Sea, insofar as this sandbar
      remains above water at all times and thus this enclave is capable of
      constituting territory appertaining to a State”.
   73. According to the Court-appointed experts, “Los Portillos/
Harbor Head Lagoon is commonly separated from the sea by [a] sand
barrier”, although there may be “temporary channels in the barrier”. This
assessment, which implies that the barrier is above water even at high
tide, was not challenged by the Parties. The Court therefore considers
that the Parties agree that both Harbor Head Lagoon and the sandbar
separating it from the Caribbean Sea are under Nicaragua’s sovereignty.
According to the experts, the sandbar extends between the points at the
edge of the north-eastern and north-western ends of the lagoon. The cur-
rent location of these points has been identiﬁed by the experts in their
report as points Ple2 and Plw2 with respective co-ordinates of
10° 55ʹ 47.23522ʺ N, 83° 40ʹ 03.02241ʺ W and 10° 56ʹ 01.38471ʺ N,
83° 40ʹ 24.12588ʺ W in WGS 84 datum. The Court concludes that the
sandbar extends between the points located at the north-eastern and


169   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





170    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

north-western ends of the lagoon, currently between points Ple2 and
Plw2, respectively; from each of these two points, the land boundary
should follow the shortest line across the sandbar to reach the low-
water mark of the coast of the Caribbean Sea (see above, p. 169, sketch-
map No. 2).

            B. Alleged Violations of Costa Rica’s Sovereignty
  74. Costa Rica’s Application includes the claim that, “by establishing
and maintaining a new military camp on the beach of Isla Portillos, Nica-
ragua has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Costa Rica,
and is in breach of the Judgment of the Court of 16 December 2015 in the
Certain Activities case”. Costa Rica was referring to a military camp that
was placed in August 2016 “to the north-west of the lagoon’s sandbar and
installed on the beach of the northern part of Isla Portillos”. Costa Rica
requests the Court to declare that “Nicaragua must withdraw its military
camp” and reserves its position with regard to further remedies.

  75. Nicaragua initially asserted that the camp was situated on the
“sandbar that separates Harbor Head Lagoon from the Caribbean Sea”.
Later in its pleadings, Nicaragua did not contest that the camp was placed
on the beach outside the limits of the sandbar separating the lagoon from
the Caribbean Sea, but argued that “the whole coast belongs to Nicara-
gua”. In any case, Nicaragua contends that the Court has not yet issued
any decision with the eﬀect of res judicata concerning the beach where the
camp was located.
  76. As an alternative argument, Nicaragua maintains that, even if the
Court were to ﬁnd that the entirety of the coast is under Costa Rican
sovereignty, the camp was still positioned on a portion of the beach that
belongs to Nicaragua, because of the presence of a channel of water run-
ning behind the camp and connecting to Harbor Head Lagoon.

                                    *
   77. The Court notes that the experts have assessed that the edge of the
north-western end of Harbor Head Lagoon lies east of the place where
the military camp was located. The Court observes that it is now common
ground that the military camp was placed by Nicaragua on the beach
close to the sandbar, but not on it. The installation of the camp thus vio-
lated Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty as deﬁned above. It follows that
the camp must be removed from Costa Rica’s territory. However, there
was no breach by Nicaragua of the 2015 Judgment because, as has been
observed above (see paragraph 69), the boundary with regard to the coast
had not been deﬁned in that Judgment.
   78. The Court considers that the declaration of a violation of
Costa Rica’s sovereignty and the order addressed to Nicaragua to remove
its camp from Costa Rica’s territory constitute appropriate reparation.


171     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

            IV. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea

   79. The Court has been requested to delimit the maritime boundaries
between the Parties in the Caribbean Sea and the Paciﬁc Ocean. The Par-
ties’ respective claims relating to the Caribbean Sea are illustrated on
sketch-map No. 3 below (p. 172).

              A. Starting-point of the Maritime Delimitation
   80. The divergent views of the Parties concerning the starting-point of
the land boundary are reﬂected in their diﬀerent approaches to deﬁning
the starting-point of the maritime delimitation in the Caribbean Sea.
According to Costa Rica, the maritime delimitation “must start at the
mouth of the San Juan River”. However, given the instability of the coast
and in particular of the features near the point where the San Juan River
ﬂows into the Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica suggests that the starting-point
of the maritime delimitation should be placed not at the western end of
the sandspit at the mouth of the river, but on “the solid ground at the
base of the spit of Isla Portillos”. According to Costa Rica, this point
coincides with the point that the Court-appointed experts called point Pv
(see paragraph 104 below).
   81. Nicaragua maintains that, according to the 1858 Treaty and the
Cleveland Award, the land boundary line “begins at the extremity of
Punta de Castilla at the mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, as
they both existed on the 15th day of April 1858” and that this point
should be used also for the maritime delimitation. Since General Alexan-
der stated in his ﬁrst Award that the point in question could “not now be
certainly located” and that
      “it best fulﬁl[led] the demands of the treaty and of President Cleve-
      land’s award to adopt what is practically the headland of to-day, or
      the north-western extremity of what seems to be the solid land, on the
      east side of Harbor Head Lagoon” (RIAA, Vol. XXVIII, p. 220),

Nicaragua argues that the point identiﬁed by General Alexander should
be adopted as the starting-point for the maritime delimitation even if it
has been submerged by the sea.
  82. In a communication to the Parties, the Court invited them to indi-
cate in their oral pleadings their positions concerning the possibility of
“starting the maritime boundary from a ﬁxed point in the Caribbean Sea
some distance from the coast”.
  83. Costa Rica’s primary position remains that the Court should select
a starting-point on land. Costa Rica suggests as an alternative that the
Court “connect any ﬁxed point at sea [on the equidistance line] to the
mouth of the San Juan River with a mobile line segment”. This ﬁxed
point would act as a “hinge point”. Costa Rica indicates that such a
point, if adopted by the Court, should be placed at a distance of 3 nauti-


172   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





173    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

cal miles from the coast, a distance suﬃcient to anticipate possible physi-
cal changes.
   84. While arguing for a diﬀerent location of the starting-point, Nicara-
gua agrees that “the ‘hinge’ solution is practicable. The line connecting
the ﬁxed point at sea with the actual land territory could be mobile, mov-
ing with natural changes in the coastline”. In its view, the ﬁxed point
should be placed at the point that General Alexander identiﬁed as the
starting-point of the land boundary and should be joined to the north-
eastern end of Harbor Head Lagoon by a mobile line.
   85. The positions taken by the Parties with regard to the starting-point of
the maritime boundary are illustrated on sketch-map No. 4 below (p. 174).

                                      *
  86. The Court observes that, since the starting-point of the land bound-
ary is currently located at the end of the sandspit bordering the San Juan
River where the river reaches the Caribbean Sea (see paragraph 71 above),
the same point would normally be the starting-point of the maritime
delimitation. However, the great instability of the coastline in the area of
the mouth of the San Juan River, as indicated by the Court-appointed
experts, prevents the identiﬁcation on the sandspit of a ﬁxed point that
would be suitable as the starting-point of the maritime delimitation. It is
preferable to select a ﬁxed point at sea and connect it to the starting-point
on the coast by a mobile line. Taking into account the fact that the pre-
vailing phenomenon characterizing the coastline at the mouth of the
San Juan River is recession through erosion from the sea, the Court
deems it appropriate to place a ﬁxed point at sea at a distance of 2 nauti-
cal miles from the coast on the median line.

                                     * *
   87. With regard to the enclave under Nicaragua’s sovereignty,
Costa Rica argues that no starting-point for the maritime delimitation
can be placed on the sandbar separating Harbor Head Lagoon from the
Caribbean Sea because of the general characteristics of the sandbar and
in particular its instability.
   88. Nicaragua addresses the issue of the starting-points of maritime
delimitation relating to the enclave only as an alternative, in the event
that the Court does not accept Nicaragua’s main contention that the
starting-point of the maritime delimitation is the same point identiﬁed by
General Alexander as the starting-point for the land boundary. Nicara-
gua notes that, should its contention not be accepted by the Court, “there
would be three land boundary termini on the Caribbean Sea deﬁning dif-
ferent stretches of coasts belonging to one Party or the other, generating
overlapping projections into the sea”.

                                      *

174   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





175     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   89. The Court notes that the sandbar separating Harbor Head Lagoon
from the Caribbean Sea is a minor feature without vegetation and char-
acterized by instability. In relation to this sandbar, the question of the
starting-points of the maritime delimitation is bound up with the eﬀects,
if any, of this feature on the maritime delimitation. This latter issue will
be addressed below, taking into account the characteristics of the feature
in question.

                   B. Delimitation of the Territorial Sea
  90. With regard to the delimitation of the territorial sea, Article 15 of
UNCLOS, which is applicable between the Parties, both of them being
party to the Convention, reads as follows :
         “Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each
      other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between
      them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median
      line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the
      baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the
      two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however,
      where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special cir-
      cumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way
      which is at variance therewith.”
The Court will use the term “median line” as in the above provision but
will refer to “equidistance line” when it summarizes pleadings of the Par-
ties where the latter term is used.


                                      *
   91. Costa Rica argues that the Court should delimit the Parties’ bound-
ary in the territorial sea ﬁrst, and thereafter in the exclusive economic
zone and on the continental shelf, by means of two diﬀerent methods.
According to Costa Rica, the Court has consistently diﬀerentiated
between the delimitation of the territorial sea under Article 15 of
UNCLOS, and the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and of the
continental shelf under Articles 74 and 83 of UNCLOS, according to
which it “shall be eﬀected by agreement on the basis of international law,
as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solution”.
   92. Nicaragua argues that Article 15 of UNCLOS does not stipulate
how the delimitation is to be eﬀected, but only how States must act failing
an agreement on delimitation. According to Nicaragua, a ﬂexible applica-
tion of the equidistance/special circumstances rule is necessary in order to
“take into account local characteristics of the conﬁguration of the coast-
line”. Nicaragua further argues that there is no practical diﬀerence
between the régime of delimitation of the territorial sea according to


176    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

Article 15 of UNCLOS and the régime applicable to the delimitation of
the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, respectively out-
lined in Articles 74 and 83 of UNCLOS. In its view, “the approaches to
delimitation of the diﬀerent maritime zones are convergent” and all rele-
vant provisions of UNCLOS must be read together and in context.

   93. Costa Rica maintains that in the delimitation of the territorial sea
Nicaragua has taken into account legal concepts and geographic features
that could only be relevant to the delimitation of its exclusive economic
zone and continental shelf. Costa Rica indicates that, while the provisions
of UNCLOS may not be taken in isolation, Article 15 “does not refer to
or incorporate Articles 74 and 83, and vice versa”: Article 15 uses diﬀer-
ent terms, concerns a diﬀerent subject-matter and consists of an autono-
mous provision. Costa Rica recalls that, in earlier cases concerning the
delimitation of the territorial sea, the Court recognized the primacy of
equidistance and decided that it would depart from an equidistance line
only if special circumstances justiﬁed such a departure. While Costa Rica
agrees that there is an element of ﬂexibility in the adjustment of the line
based on the existence of special circumstances, it maintains that this ﬂex-
ibility could not override the plain meaning of the text of UNCLOS
which distinguishes between delimitation methods in diﬀerent maritime
zones.
   94. However, the Parties agree that, for the delimitation of the territo-
rial sea, it is ﬁrst necessary to establish the equidistance line. The Parties
proceeded to discuss the delimitation of the territorial sea on the basis of
the same method. They began by drawing a provisional equidistance line,
and subsequently argued whether special circumstances existed that
would justify the adjustment of the line.
   95. Costa Rica recalls that base points must be selected on coastal fea-
tures that represent the “physical reality at the time of the delimitation”
(referring to Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine),
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 106, para. 131). Consequently, base
points should not be placed on “ephemeral, sandy, unstable features”.
According to Costa Rica, those features include Barra Morris Creek, a
sandbar on the left bank of the mouth of the San Juan River, and the
sandspit north-west of Isla Portillos.

   96. Nicaragua identiﬁes base points on dry land “and not . . . any
points that lie upon straight baselines but not upon land”. Nicaragua
criticizes the fact that, in the construction of the equidistance line in the
territorial sea, Costa Rica did not place base points on Paxaro Bovo and
Palmenta Cays. According to Nicaragua, these features are entitled to a
territorial sea and cannot be disregarded in the drawing of the equidis-
tance line in the territorial sea.
   97. Objecting to Nicaragua’s view that base points should be placed on
Paxaro Bovo and Palmenta Cays for the construction of the equidistance
line in the territorial sea, Costa Rica argues that, in light of their location,


177    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

those features can have no impact on the course of the delimitation line
in the territorial sea.


                                      *
   98. In accordance with its established jurisprudence, the Court will
proceed in two stages: ﬁrst, the Court will draw a provisional median line;
second, it will consider whether any special circumstances exist which jus-
tify adjusting such a line (Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions
between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Merits, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 94, para. 176; Territorial and Maritime Dispute
between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v.
Honduras), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 740, para. 268).
   99. The Court notes that Nicaragua has adopted a system of straight
baselines in the Caribbean Sea by Decree No. 33-2013 of 19 August 2013,
which Costa Rica has challenged. However, Nicaragua does not rely on
those baselines for determining the equidistance lines concerning the ter-
ritorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.

  100. The Court will construct the provisional median line for delimiting
the territorial sea only on the basis of points situated on the natural coast,
which may include points placed on islands or rocks. The base points used
by the Court are located on salient points that are situated on solid land
and thus have a relatively higher stability than points placed on sandy fea-
tures. The placement of these base points is illustrated on sketch-map No. 5
below (p. 180). The Court observes that Paxaro Bovo and Palmenta Cays
do not aﬀect the construction of the median line in the territorial sea.

                                     * *
   101. Nicaragua contends that the equidistance line in the territorial sea
should be adjusted in view of a “special circumstance” consisting in “the
exaggerated cut-oﬀ resulting from the change from a convex to a concave
coastline in the immediate vicinity of the Punta de Castilla starting-
point”. Nicaragua maintains that this portion of the coast does not reﬂect
its general direction and notes that the resulting deviation “persists for a
signiﬁcant part of the length of the equidistance line”. It argues that the
convex-concave combination has to be regarded as a special circumstance
requiring an adjustment of the strict equidistance line in the territorial
sea. According to Nicaragua, it is “common ground that cut-oﬀs result-
ing from coastal conﬁgurations” may lead to necessary adjustments of the
provisional equidistance line.
   102. Costa Rica argues that there are no “special circumstances which
require a delimitation of the territorial sea other than on the basis of equi-
distance”. In response to Nicaragua’s argument, Costa Rica contends
that recourse to the equidistance line would not create any inequitable


178    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

cut-oﬀ within the territorial sea. It maintains that Nicaragua’s argument
is based on an “artiﬁcially expanded geographic scope for the territorial
sea delimitation” and inaccurate depictions of the coastal projections that
it alleges would be cut oﬀ. According to Costa Rica, the boundary in the
territorial sea should therefore follow an unadjusted equidistance line.


                                     *
   103. The Court considers that, for the delimitation of the territorial
sea, the combined eﬀect of the concavity of Nicaragua’s coast west of the
mouth of the San Juan River and of the convexity of Costa Rica’s coast
east of Harbor Head Lagoon is of limited signiﬁcance and does not rep-
resent a special circumstance that could justify an adjustment of the
median line under Article 15 of UNCLOS.
   104. However, the Court considers that a special circumstance aﬀect-
ing maritime delimitation in the territorial sea consists in the high insta-
bility and narrowness of the sandspit near the mouth of the San Juan
River which constitutes a barrier between the Caribbean Sea and a size-
able territory appertaining to Nicaragua (see paragraph 86 above). The
instability of this sandspit does not allow one to select a base point on
that part of Costa Rica’s territory, as Costa Rica acknowledges, or to
connect a point on the sandspit to the ﬁxed point at sea for the ﬁrst part
of the delimitation line. The Court is of the view that it is more appropri-
ate that the ﬁxed point at sea on the median line, referred to in para-
graph 86 above, be connected by a mobile line to the point on solid land
on Costa Rica’s coast which is closest to the mouth of the river. Under
the present circumstances, this point has been identiﬁed by the Court-
appointed experts as point Pv, with co-ordinates 10° 56ʹ 22.56ʺ N,
83° 41ʹ 51.81ʺ W (WGS 84 datum), but there may be geomorphological
changes over time. For the present, the delimitation line in the territorial
sea thus extends from the ﬁxed point at sea landwards to the point on the
low-water mark of the coast of the Caribbean Sea that is closest to
point Pv. From the ﬁxed point seawards, the delimitation line in the ter-
ritorial sea is the median line as determined by the base points selected in
relation to the present situation of the coast.

   105. The Court considers that another special circumstance is relevant
for the delimitation of the territorial sea. The instability of the sandbar
separating Harbor Head Lagoon from the Caribbean Sea and its situa-
tion as a small enclave within Costa Rica’s territory call for a special
solution. Should territorial waters be attributed to the enclave, they would
be of little use to Nicaragua, while breaking the continuity of Costa Rica’s
territorial sea. Under these circumstances, the delimitation in the territo-
rial sea between the Parties will not take into account any entitlement
which might result from the enclave.



179      maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

  106. The delimitation line in the territorial sea is obtained by joining
landwards the ﬁxed point at sea deﬁned below with the point on solid
land on Costa Rica’s coast that is closest to the mouth of the river (see
paragraph 104 above) and by joining seawards with geodetic lines the
points with the following co-ordinates in WGS 84 datum:

The boundary in the territorial sea shall terminate at point Lx (with cur-
rent co-ordinates 11° 07ʹ 28.8ʺ N and 83° 36ʹ 30.4ʺ W), at the intersection
of the 12-nautical-mile line with the geodetic line connecting point L with
the ﬁrst turning point on the provisional equidistance line in the exclusive
economic zone, identiﬁed as point 1 and having the co-ordinates indi-
cated at paragraph 145 below. The delimitation line is illustrated on

              C. Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone
                         and the Continental Shelf
   107. The Court will now proceed to the delimitation of the exclu-
sive economic zones and continental shelves appertaining to Costa Rica
and Nicaragua, for which both Parties requested the Court to draw a
single delimitation line. The relevant provisions of UNCLOS read as
follows :
      Article 74
        “The delimitation of the exclusive economic zone between States
      with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be eﬀected by agreement on the
      basis of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute
      of the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable
      solution.”




180   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





181     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

        Article 83
         “The delimitation of the continental shelf between States with
      opposite or adjacent coasts shall be eﬀected by agreement on the basis
      of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the
      International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solu-
      tion.”
(a) Relevant coasts and relevant area
      (i) Relevant coasts
   108. An essential step in maritime delimitation is identifying the rele-
vant coasts : those that “generate projections which overlap with projec-
tions from the coast of the other Party” (Maritime Delimitation in the
Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 97,
para. 99). For deﬁning the criteria applicable to determining when rele-
vant overlapping projections exist, both Parties refer to the Court’s juris-
prudence and to a passage in the arbitral award in Bay of Bengal Maritime
Boundary Arbitration (Bangladesh v. India), in which the arbitral tribunal
noted that “there is a margin of appreciation in determining the projec-
tions generated by a segment of coastline and a point at which a line
drawn at an acute angle to the general direction of the coast can no lon-
ger be fairly said to represent the seaward projection of that coast” (Tri-
bunal established under Annex VII of UNCLOS, Award of 7 July 2014,
International Law Reports, Vol. 167, p. 86, para. 302).


   109. However, Nicaragua and Costa Rica take diﬀerent approaches to
the determination of the relevant coasts in the present proceedings. Nica-
ragua argues that a segment of coast may be considered relevant only if
its frontal projection “overlaps with the seaward projection of the coast
of [the] other Party”, the term “seaward” having “the connotation of ‘in
the direction of the sea’”. Costa Rica contends that, with some exceptions
concerning particular situations — such as the case of a coast that “faces
entirely away from the area of overlapping potential entitlements” — the
relevant coasts are determined by establishing which coasts generate over-
lapping entitlements by employing radial projections, using an envelope
of arcs.
   110. Notwithstanding this divergence of methods, the Parties reach
nearly identical solutions with regard to the relevant coasts on the Carib-
bean Sea. According to Nicaragua, “its relevant coast includes the coast
up to Coconut Point”, while the entire coast of Costa Rica is relevant (see
below, p. 183, sketch-map No. 7). Costa Rica takes the same position
with regard to its own coast but considers that “only the coast of Nicara-
gua ending at or near Punta de Perlas is relevant on the Nicaraguan
coast” (see below, p. 182, sketch-map No. 6).




182   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

                              *

184     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   111. The Court considers that the entire mainland coast of Costa Rica
is relevant. In the Court’s view, the mainland coast of Nicaragua is rele-
vant up to Punta Gorda (north), where the coast shows a signiﬁcant
inﬂexion. All these coasts generate projections that overlap with projec-
tions from the other Party’s coast.
   112. One divergence between the Parties regarding the relevant coasts
concerns Nicaragua’s contention that a few kilometres should be added
to the overall length of its relevant coast because some parts of the coasts
of the Corn Islands and of the Cayos de Perlas should also be included.
The Court observes that the Corn Islands, but not the Cayos de Perlas,
were already considered in the Judgment in the case between Nicaragua
and Colombia as parts of the relevant coast, contributing “base points for
the construction of the provisional median line” with regard to the conti-
nental shelf and the exclusive economic zone (Territorial and Maritime
Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II),
pp. 698-699, para. 201). According to that Judgment, the coasts of the
Corn Islands did not “add to the length of the relevant coast”, but this
was for a reason that does not apply in the present case, namely that in
relation to Colombia’s islands the Corn Islands were “parallel to the
mainland” (ibid., p. 678, para. 145).

   113. The coasts of the Corn Islands that do not face north also have to
be included when determining the length of the relevant coasts. On the
other hand, no evidence concerning the capacity of the Cayos de Perlas to
“sustain human habitation or economic life of their own” as required by
Article 121 of UNCLOS was supplied by Nicaragua to support its asser-
tion that “the Cayos de Perlas generate maritime projections”. Therefore
their coasts should not be included among the relevant coasts.

  114. Given the fact that the relevant coasts of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica are not characterized by sinuosity, the length of the relevant
coasts should preferably be measured on the basis of their natural con-
ﬁguration. This results in a total length of the coasts of 228.8 km for
Costa Rica and of 465.8 km for Nicaragua, with a ratio of 1:2.04 in
favour of Nicaragua (see below, p. 185, sketch-map No. 8).
      (ii) Relevant area
  115. As the Court indicated in Territorial and Maritime Dispute
(Nicaragua v. Colombia), “[t]he relevant area comprises that part of the
maritime space in which the potential entitlements of the parties overlap”
(Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 683, para. 159).

  116. The Court also recalls its observation that “the legal concept of
the ‘relevant area’ has to be taken into account as part of the methodol-
ogy of maritime delimitation” (Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea
(Romania v. Ukraine), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 99, para. 110).


185   maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)





186     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

Moreover, “[d]epending on the conﬁguration of the relevant coasts in the
general geographical context, the relevant area may include certain mari-
time spaces and exclude others which are not germane to the case in
hand” (Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Judg-
ment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 682, para. 157).

                                      *
  117. The Parties agree that the relevant area should not include the
spaces attributed to Colombia on the basis of the 2012 Judgment and
those attributed to Panama by the 1980 bilateral treaty concluded with
Costa Rica. This conforms with what the Court stated in Territorial and
Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
2012 (II), p. 685, para. 163):
         “The Court recalls that the relevant area cannot extend beyond the
      area in which the entitlements of both Parties overlap. Accordingly,
      if either Party has no entitlement in a particular area, whether because
      of an agreement it has concluded with a third State or because that
      area lies beyond a judicially determined boundary between that Party
      and a third State, that area cannot be treated as part of the relevant
      area for present purposes.”
   118. In the north, in order to determine the relevant area, Nicaragua
submits that a perpendicular line to the general direction of the coast
should be drawn starting from Coconut Point until it reaches the bound-
ary with Colombia (see above, p. 183, sketch-map No. 7). Costa Rica
contends that the relevant area should also comprise waters falling
“within the radial projection of other parts of coast that are relevant”.
This would increase the part of the relevant area attributed to Nicaragua
(see above, p. 182, sketch-map No. 6).
   119. To deﬁne the relevant area in the south, Costa Rica adopts a
notional line continuing along the direction of its maritime boundary
with Panama as set out in their bilateral treaty of 1980. Nicaragua’s posi-
tion on the relevant area is that it should be bounded to the south by the
lines drawn in the 1980 treaty between Costa Rica and Panama and in the
1977 treaty between Costa Rica and Colombia (see orange area on
sketch-map No. 7 above). However, Nicaragua contends that, if the
Court were to adopt Costa Rica’s position on the 1977 Treaty and extend
the relevant area beyond the limits set out therein, that area should be
bounded by the line drawn in the 1976 Treaty between Panama and
Colombia (see light brown area on sketch-map No. 7). Nicaragua rejects
Costa Rica’s approach of using the notional extension of the line set out
in the 1980 Treaty to deﬁne the relevant area as it would exclude an area
to the south of that line where only Costa Rica or Nicaragua may have
claims.

                                      *

187     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   120. The Court considers that, except for the space attributed to
Colombia in the 2012 Judgment, the area where there are overlapping
projections in the north includes the whole maritime space situated within
a distance of 200 nautical miles from Costa Rica’s coast.
   121. In the south, the situation is more complicated because of the
presence of claims of third States on which the Court cannot pronounce
itself (see subsection (b) below). The impact of the rights of third States
in the areas that may be attributed to one of the Parties cannot be deter-
mined, but the spaces where third States have a claim may nevertheless be
included. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea case (Romania v.
Ukraine) (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 100, para. 114), the Court
observed that:
      “where areas are included solely for the purpose of approximate iden-
      tiﬁcation of overlapping entitlements of the Parties to the case, which
      may be deemed to constitute the relevant area (and which in due
      course will play a part in the ﬁnal stage testing for disproportionality),
      third party entitlements cannot be aﬀected.”

  122. The Court will further analyse the issue of the relevant area in
subsection (e) below.
(b) Relevance of bilateral treaties and judgments involving third States


   123. An issue is raised by the fact that, in the area of the Caribbean Sea
in which the Court is requested to delimit the maritime boundary between
the Parties, third States may also have claims. As was stated in Territorial
and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), the Court’s Judgment
may only address the maritime boundary between the Parties, “without
prejudice to any claim of a third State or any claim which either Party
may have against a third State” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II),
p. 707, para. 228). The Judgment can refer to those claims, but cannot
determine whether they are well founded. Conversely, a judgment ren-
dered by the Court between one of the Parties and a third State or between
two third States cannot per se aﬀect the maritime boundary between the
Parties. The same applies to treaties concluded between one of the Parties
and a third State or between third States.


                                       *
   124. Nicaragua acknowledges that treaties cannot be relied on by
States that are not party to them, but nevertheless presents arguments
concerning maritime delimitation on the basis of three treaties to which it
is not a party, one between Costa Rica and Colombia, another between
Costa Rica and Panama and the last between Colombia and Panama.


188     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

With regard to the 1977 Treaty on Delimitation of Marine and Submarine
Areas and Maritime Co-operation between Costa Rica and Colombia,
Nicaragua argues that this treaty “ﬁxed and limited Costa Rica’s interests
in the maritime spaces of the Caribbean Sea” and that it consolidated
Costa Rica’s potential claims in the area.
   125. Moreover, Nicaragua states that although the treaty between
Costa Rica and Colombia has not been ratiﬁed, it “was in fact enforced
according to its provisions”. According to Nicaragua, compliance by
Costa Rica with the terms of the treaty for approximately 40 years gener-
ated binding obligations for Costa Rica. In Nicaragua’s view, statements
made by Costa Rica “constituted an irrevocable commitment to ratify
[the treaty], once all the parliamentary requirements had been satisﬁed”.
   126. Nicaragua claims that the boundary established by the 1977 Treaty
between Costa Rica and Colombia must be taken into account in the
delimitation between the Parties in the present case in the exclusive eco-
nomic zone and continental shelf. That boundary, in Nicaragua’s view,
“deﬁnes — and limits — the extent of Costa Rica’s maritime areas in the
Caribbean Sea” and prevents Costa Rica from claiming any area to the
north and east of that line.
   127. According to Nicaragua,
      “there can have been no vacuum in the areas of the South-Western
      Caribbean attributed to Colombia in its 1977 Treaty with Costa Rica.
      If the areas were not claimed by Costa Rica in 1977, they appertained
      to Colombia : and following the Court’s Judgment of 2012, some of
      those areas now belong to Nicaragua.”

   128. With regard to the 1980 Treaty between Costa Rica and Panama,
Nicaragua acknowledges that this treaty is also res inter alios acta in rela-
tion to Nicaragua, but nevertheless it argues that the treaty creates “a
legal régime and scenario which the Court cannot ignore”. According to
Nicaragua, Article 1 of the treaty establishes a tripoint at the intersection
of the boundaries concerning Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama. This
provision, in Nicaragua’s view, also gives eﬀect to the 1977 Treaty
between Costa Rica and Colombia.
   129. Concerning the 1976 Treaty between Colombia and Panama,
Nicaragua argues that Panama can no longer have any claim in the
area north of the boundary line, because it would be incompatible
with that treaty. In Nicaragua’s view, also Colombia cannot have any
claim in that area, as this would be incompatible with the boundary
drawn by the Court in Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v.
Colombia). Therefore, only Nicaragua or Costa Rica may have claims in
that area.
   130. In its Counter-Memorial, Nicaragua observes that the 2012 Judg-
ment of the Court is not binding on Costa Rica, but that “a departure
from its ﬁndings would be warranted only if new and compelling elements
would justify such a departure”.


189    maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   131. With regard to the 1977 Treaty between Costa Rica and Colom-
bia, Costa Rica argues that this treaty has not been ratiﬁed and that thus,
according to its terms, it has never entered into force and cannot have the
same eﬀects as if it were ratiﬁed. Despite Costa Rica’s practice of compli-
ance with regard to the boundary ﬁxed by the treaty, the latter is res inter
alios acta in relation to Nicaragua and should not be taken into account
in the present case. Costa Rica further asserts that the treaty could not

maritime boundary. According to Costa Rica, while these treaties may be
