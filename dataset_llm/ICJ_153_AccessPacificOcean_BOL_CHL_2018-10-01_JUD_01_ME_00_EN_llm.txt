                       1. On 24 April 2013, the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia
                    (hereinafter “Bolivia”) filed in the Registry of the Court an Application institut-
                    ing proceedings against the Republic of Chile (hereinafter “Chile”) with regard
                    to a dispute “relating to Chile’s obligation to negotiate in good faith and effec-
                    tively with Bolivia in order to reach an agreement granting Bolivia a fully sov-
                    ereign access to the Pacific Ocean”.
                       In its Application, Bolivia seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on
                    Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement signed on 30 April
                    1948, officially designated, according to Article LX thereof, as the “Pact of
                    Bogotá” (hereinafter referred to as such).
                       2. In accordance with Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court,
                    the Registrar immediately communicated the Application to the Government of
                    Chile; and, under paragraph 3 of that Article, all other States entitled to appear
                    before the Court were notified of the Application.
                       3. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of
                    either of the Parties, each Party proceeded to exercise the right conferred upon
                    it by Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the
                    case. Bolivia chose Mr. Yves Daudet. Chile first chose Ms Louise Arbour, who
                    resigned on 26 May 2017, and subsequently Mr. Donald M. McRae.
                       4. By an Order of 18 June 2013, the Court fixed 17 April 2014 as the time-
                    limit for the filing of the Memorial of Bolivia and 18 February 2015 for the filing
                    of the Counter-­Memorial of Chile. Bolivia filed its Memorial within the time-
                    limit so prescribed.
                       5. Referring to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Govern-
                    ments of Peru and Colombia respectively asked to be furnished with copies of
                    the pleadings and documents annexed in the case. Having ascertained the views
                    of the Parties pursuant to that same provision, the President of the Court
                    decided to grant those requests. The Registrar duly communicated these deci-
                    sions to the said Governments and to the Parties.
                       6. On 15 July 2014, within the time-limit set by Article 79, paragraph 1, of
                    the Rules of Court, Chile raised a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the
                    Court. Consequently, by an Order of 15 July 2014, the President, noting that by
                    virtue of Article 79, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court the proceedings on the
                    merits were suspended and taking account of Practice Direction V, fixed
                    14 November 2014 as the time-limit for the presentation by Bolivia of a written
                    statement of its observations and submissions on the preliminary objection
                    raised by Chile. Bolivia filed such a statement within the time-limit so pre-
                    scribed.
                       7. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of
                    Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the Pact of Bogotá the noti-
                    fications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court. In
                    accordance with the provisions of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court,
                    the Registrar sent at the same time to the Organization of American States
                    (hereinafter the “OAS”) the notification under Article 34, paragraph 3, of the
                    Statute of the Court. As provided for in Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of
                    Court, the Registrar transmitted the written pleadings to the OAS and asked
                    that organization whether or not it intended to furnish observations in writing
                    within the meaning of that Article. The Registrar further stated in the latter






5 CIJ1150.indb 20                                                                                          22/05/19 10:55

                    516 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                    notification that, in view of the fact that the proceedings were dealing with
                    Chile’s preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, any written obser-
                    vations should be limited to that aspect. The Secretary-­General of the OAS indi-
                    cated that that organization did not intend to submit any such observations.
                        8. Public hearings on the preliminary objection raised by Chile were held
                    from Monday 4 to Friday 8 May 2015. By its Judgment of 24 September 2015,
                    the Court rejected the preliminary objection raised by Chile and found that it
                    had jurisdiction, on the basis of Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá, to enter-
                    tain the Application filed by Bolivia on 24 April 2013.
                        9. By an Order dated 24 September 2015, the Court fixed 25 July 2016 as the
                    time-limit for the filing of the Counter-­    Memorial of Chile. The Counter-­
                    Memorial was filed within the time-limit thus fixed.
                        10. By an Order dated 21 September 2016, the Court authorized the submis-
                    sion of a Reply by Bolivia and a Rejoinder by Chile and fixed 21 March 2017
                    and 21 September 2017 as the respective time-­      limits for the filing of those
                    ­pleadings. The Reply and the Rejoinder were filed within the time-­limits thus
                     fixed.
                        11. Pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the Court,
                     after ascertaining the views of the Parties, decided that copies of the pleadings
                     and documents annexed would be made accessible to the public on the opening
                     of the oral proceedings.
                        12. Public hearings were held from 19 March to 28 March 2018, at which the
                     Court heard the oral arguments and replies of:

                      13. In the Application, the following claims were made by Bolivia:
                           “For the above reasons Bolivia respectfully requests the Court to adjudge
                         and declare that :

                                    I. Historical and Factual Background

                       16. Bolivia is situated in South America, bordering Chile to the south-
                    west, Peru to the west, Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay to the
                    south-east and Argentina to the south. Bolivia has no sea coast. Chile, for
                    its part, shares a land boundary with Peru to the north, with Bolivia to
                    the north-east and with Argentina to the east. Its mainland coast faces the
                    Pacific Ocean to the west.
                       17. Due to the importance of the historical context of this dispute, the
                    Court will now examine in a chronological order certain events that have
                    marked the relationship between Bolivia and Chile.
                       18. Many of the documents that set out these events were drafted in
                    Spanish, and they have not always been translated by the Parties into an
                    official language of the Court in an identical manner. Where these differ-
                    ences are material, the Court will, for the sake of clarity, reproduce the
                    Spanish original of those documents, and indicate which Party’s transla-
                    tion is being quoted as well as any material variation in the translations
                    provided by the Parties.

                                       1. Events and Treaties prior to 1904,
                                        Including the 1895 Transfer Treaty
                       19. Chile and Bolivia gained their independence from Spain in 1818
                    and 1825, respectively. At the time of its independence, Bolivia had a
                    coastline of over 400 km along the Pacific Ocean.
                       20. On 10 August 1866, Chile and Bolivia signed a Treaty of Territo-
                    rial Limits, which established a demarcation line between the two States,
                    following the 24th parallel of latitude south, separating their Pacific coast
                    territories. The instruments of ratification were exchanged on 9 Decem-
                    ber 1866. The boundary was confirmed by the Treaty of Limits of
                    6 August 1874, and the instruments of ratification thereof were exchanged
                    on 28 July and 22 September 1875.
                       21. On 5 April 1879, Chile declared war on Peru and Bolivia. In the
                    course of this war, which became known as the War of the Pacific, Chile
                    occupied Bolivia’s coastal territory. Bolivia and Chile put an end to the
                    hostilities between them with the signature of the Truce Pact of 4 April
                    1884 in Valparaíso, Chile. Under the terms of the Truce Pact, Chile was,
                    inter alia, to continue to govern “the territories from the parallel 23 to
                    the mouth of the Loa River in the Pacific”, i.e. the coastal region of
                    Bolivia.
                       22. The Treaty of Peace between Chile and Peru signed on 20 October
                    1883 (hereinafter the “Treaty of Ancón”) brought hostilities formally to an
                    end between Chile and Peru. Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty of Ancón,
                    Peru ceded to Chile the coastal province of Tarapacá. In addition, under
                    Article 3, Chile would remain in the possession of the territories of the prov-
                    inces of Tacna and Arica for a period of ten years, after which a plebiscite
                    would be held to definitively determine sovereignty over those territories.

                    519 	        obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                       23. On 18 May 1895, Bolivia and Chile signed three treaties: a Treaty
                    of Peace and Amity, a Treaty on the Transfer of Territory and a Treaty
                    of Commerce. The Treaty of Peace and Amity reaffirmed Chile’s sover-
                    eignty over the coastal territory it governed in accordance with the Truce
                    Pact of 4 April 1884. Under the Treaty on the Transfer of Territory,
                    Bolivia and Chile agreed, inter alia, that the territories of Tacna and
                    Arica were to be transferred to Bolivia if Chile should acquire “dominion
                    and permanent sovereignty” over them either by direct negotiations or by
                    way of the plebiscite envisaged by the 1883 Treaty of Ancón. Should
                    Chile fail to obtain the two territories mentioned above, either through
                    direct negotiations with Peru or by plebiscite, Article IV of the Treaty on
                    the Transfer of Territory provided that Chile would cede to Bolivia the
                    territory “from the Vítor inlet up to the Camarones ravine, or an equiva-
                    lent territory”. These three treaties were followed by four protocols.
                       24. On 9 December 1895, Chile and Bolivia agreed to a Protocol on
                    the scope of the obligations in the treaties of 18 May 1895 which clarified
                    the obligations undertaken by the Parties. By an exchange of Notes of
                    29 and 30 April 1896, it was agreed that these three treaties of 18 May
                    1895 were to enter into force on the condition that the Congresses of
                    both Chile and Bolivia approved this Protocol. As this condition was
                    never met, the three treaties of 18 May 1895 never entered into force.


                                            2. The 1904 Peace Treaty
                       25. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 20 October 1904 (herein­
                    after the “1904 Peace Treaty”) officially ended the War of the Pacific as
                    between Bolivia and Chile. This Treaty entered into force on 10 March
                    1905 after the instruments of ratification were exchanged between the
                    Parties. Under the terms of its Article II, the territory occupied by Chile
                    in application of the Truce Pact of 1884 was recognized as belonging
                    “absolutely and in perpetuity” to Chile and the entire boundary between
                    the two States was delimited. Article III provided for the construction of
                    a railroad between the port of Arica and the plateau of La Paz, at the
                    expense of Chile, which was inaugurated on 13 May 1913. Under Arti-
                    cle VI, Chile granted to Bolivia “in perpetuity the amplest and freest right
                    of commercial transit in its territory and its Pacific ports”. Under Arti-
                    cle VII of the Treaty, Bolivia had “the right to establish customs agencies
                    in the ports which it may designate for its commerce” and indicated for
                    this purpose the ports of Antofagasta and Arica.


                                    3. Exchanges and Statements in the 1920s
                    A. The 1920 “Acta Protocolizada”
                      26. Before the events of 1920, in a memorandum of 22 April 1910,
                    Bolivia, referring to the dispute between Chile and Peru regarding





5 CIJ1150.indb 28                                                                                  22/05/19 10:55

                    520 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                    the ­sovereignty of Tacna and Arica, had already expressed the view
                    that :
                         “[it] cannot live isolated from the sea. Now and always, to the extent
                         of its abilities, it will do as much as possible to possess at least one
                         port on the Pacific, and will never resign itself to inaction each time
                         the Tacna and Arica question is raised, jeopardizing the very founda-
                         tion of its existence.”
                       27. In a memorandum of 9 September 1919, submitted by the Minister
                    Plenipotentiary of Chile in La Paz, Bolivia, it was stated, inter alia, that
                    Chile was willing to initiate negotiations, independently of what was
                    established by the 1904 Peace Treaty, in order for Bolivia to acquire an
                    outlet to the sea subject to the result of the plebiscite envisaged by the
                    1883 Treaty of Ancón.
                       28. On 10 January 1920, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia,
                    and the Minister Plenipotentiary of Chile in La Paz met in order to
                    address, inter alia, questions relating to Bolivia’s access to the sea and
                    documented the series of meetings in writing. These minutes are referred
                    to by the Parties as “Acta Protocolizada”.
                       29. The representative of Chile proposed the following terms of agree-
                    ment:
                            “I. The Treaty of Peace and Amity celebrated between Chile and
                         Bolivia on 20 October 1904 defines the political relations of the two
                         countries in a definitive manner and put an end to all the questions
                         derived from the war of 1879.
                            II. Chile has fulfilled the obligations that said Treaty imposed on
                         it, and the essence of that negotiation was to link the territory of
                         Tacna and Arica to Chile’s dominion, Bolivia expressly committing
                         to cooperate to that result.
                            III. The Bolivian aspiration to its own port was replaced by the
                         construction of the railway that connects the port of Arica with
                         El Alto de la Paz and the rest of the obligations undertaken by
                         Chile.
                            IV. The situation created by the Treaty of 1904, the interests located
                         in that zone and the security of its northern frontier, require Chile to
                         preserve the maritime coast that is indispensable to it ; however, for
                         the purpose of founding the future union of the two countries on solid
                         ground, Chile is willing to seek that Bolivia acquire its own access to
                         the sea, ceding to it an important part of that zone in the north of
                         Arica and of the railway line which is within the territories subject to
                         the plebiscite stipulated in the Treaty of Ancón.

                            V. Independently of what was established in the Treaty of Peace of
                         1904, Chile accepts to initiate new negotiations directed at satisfying
                         the aspiration of the friendly country, subject to the victory of Chile
                         in the plebiscite.





5 CIJ1150.indb 30                                                                                    22/05/19 10:55

                    521 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                           VI. A prior agreement would determine the line that must indicate
                         the limit between the zones of Arica and Tacna that would pass to
                         the dominion of Chile and Bolivia, respectively, as well as all other
                         commercial compensations or compensations of another nature that
                         are the basis of the agreement.”
                      30. The representative of Bolivia then responded as follows:
                            “III. Bolivia’s aspiration for its own port on the Pacific Ocean has
                         not been reduced at any time in history and has currently reached a
                         greater intensity. The railway from Arica to El Alto de La Paz that
                         has facilitated Bolivian trade, contributes to promoting the legitimate
                         aspiration of securing a port that can be incorporated under Bolivian
                         sovereignty. That aspiration will not, however, lead Bolivia to commit
                         any act contrary to the law.
                            IV. The willingness demonstrated by Chile to obtain for Bolivia an
                         access of its own to the sea, ceding to it a considerable part of the
                         area north of Arica and of the railway line found within the territories
                         subject to the plebiscite established by the Treaty of Ancón, opens the
                         way to more friendly relations between both countries which are nec-
                         essary for the future union of both peoples by laying solid foundations
                         in line with their common goals.”

                      31. The penultimate clause of the minutes specified that the Minister
                    for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia considered that: “the present declarations
                    do not contain provisions that create rights, or obligations for the States
                    whose representatives make them”.

                    B. Follow-up exchanges (1920-1925)
                       32. On 1 November 1920, Bolivia wrote to the Secretary-­General of
                    the League of Nations with a view to obtaining the revision of the
                    1904 Peace Treaty by the League of Nations, in accordance with Arti-
                    cle 19 of the Treaty of Versailles which provided that the “Assembly
                    may . . . advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties
                    which have become inapplicable”.
                       33. On 28 September 1921, during the Twenty-­Second Plenary Meet-
                    ing of the Assembly of the League of Nations, Bolivia withdrew its
                    request, following the determination by a commission of jurists that the
                    Bolivian request was inadmissible. The reason given was that the Assem-
                    bly of the League of Nations was not competent to modify treaties, as
                    only the contracting States could do it. Bolivia nevertheless reserved its
                    right to submit this request to the Assembly again.
                       34. During this meeting, the delegate of Chile replied, inter alia,
                    that:
                         “Bolivia can seek satisfaction through the medium of direct negotia-
                         tions of our own arranging. Chile has never closed that door to





5 CIJ1150.indb 32                                                                                   22/05/19 10:55

                    522 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                         Bolivia, and I am in a position to state that nothing would please us
                         better than to sit down with her and discuss the best means of facili-
                         tating her development.”
                    The Chilean delegate also stated that :
                         “[t]he Bolivian delegation has considered it necessary to make a state-
                         ment to the effect that it ‘reserves its rights’. I trust we are right in
                         thinking that this statement signifies that, in conformity with the opin-
                         ion of the Jurists, who declare that ‘the modification of treaties lies
                         solely within the competence of the contracting States’, Bolivia has
                         finally decided to exercise the only right she can assert : namely, the
                         right of negotiation with Chile, not with a view to the revision of the
                         Treaty of 1904 . . . We find it impossible to believe that Bolivia
                         intends, in making this reservation of right, to leave definitely open,
                         and to renew later, even in a different form, a request which is devoid
                         of any legal foundation . . . Chile wishes to state that she will always
                         oppose, as she opposes today, the inclusion in the agenda of the
                         Assembly of any request of Bolivia with regard to a question upon

                    reservation of its right to submit a request “for the revision or the exami-
                    nation” of the 1904 Peace Treaty and that negotiations with Chile had
                    been “fruitless”. On 19 September 1922, the Chilean delegate to the
                    Assembly of the League of Nations responded as follows:
                         “in accordance with the declaration made by its delegation at the
                         second Assembly, the Chilean Government has expressed the greatest
                         willingness to enter into direct negotiations, which it would conduct
                         in a spirit of frank conciliation.
                            I desire to state that the declaration of M. Gutierrez, concerning
                         the mission of the Bolivian Minister at Santiago, is not in accordance
                         with the true facts of the case.
                            The President of the Republic of Chile . . . informed the Bolivian
                         representative . . . that he did not recognize the right of the Bolivian
                         Government to claim a port on the Pacific Ocean, since Bolivia aban-
                         doned that aspiration when it signed the Treaty of Peace of 1904, and
                         obtained in exchange the assumption by Chile of heavy engagements
                         which have been entirely carried out. The President of the Republic
                         added that the aspirations of Bolivia might be satisfied by other
                         means, and that his Government was quite ready to enter into nego-
                         tiations on this subject in a sincere spirit of peace and conciliation.”

                      36. In 1922 and 1923, parallel to its attempts to revise the 1904 Peace
                    Treaty, Bolivia further continued to negotiate directly with Chile in order
                    to obtain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.

                    523 	              obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                       37. On 6 February 1923, in response to a Note of 27 January 1923 of
                    the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Worship, in which the revi-
                    sion of the 1904 Peace Treaty was proposed, the Chilean Minister for
                    Foreign Affairs stated that the Chilean Government remained open to the
                    Bolivian proposals aimed at concluding a new Pact to address “Bolivia’s
                    situation, but without modifying the Peace Treaty and without interrupt-
                    ing the continuity of the Chilean territory”. He added that Chile “will
                    devote great efforts to consult [Bolivia], in light of the concrete proposals
                    that Bolivia submits and when appropriate, the bases of direct negotia-
                    tions leading, through mutual compensation and without detriment to
                    inalienable rights, to the fulfilment of this longing”.

                       38. In a Note dated 12 February 1923 to the Chilean Minister for For-
                    eign Affairs, the Minister Plenipotentiary of Bolivia in Chile requested the
                    revision of the 1904 Peace Treaty and stated that:
                            “If the request that I was asked to make does not receive the
                         response that my country expects, and instead you inform me that the
                         Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs is willing to hear the proposals
                         that my Government wants to submit to it, in order to enter into a
                         treaty at the right time, and with mutual compensation, which, with-
                         out modifying the Treaty of Peace and without interrupting the con-
                         tinuity of Chilean territory, considers the situation and Bolivia’s
                         aspirations and which your Government would make every effort to
                         bring about, I can do nothing more than tell you that my Government
                         has instructed me to put an end to these negotiations, as the reason
                         for them was to seek a firm and secure basis on which Bolivia’s aspi-
                         rations could be reconciled with Chile’s interests.”

                      39. In a Note of 22 February 1923 to the Minister Plenipotentiary of
                    Bolivia in Chile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile stated:

                         “[the 1904 Peace] Treaty does not contain any other territorial stipula-
                         tion than the one declaring Chile’s absolute and perpetual dominion of
                         the area of the former Littoral included in the Atacama Desert, which
                         had been the subject of a long dispute between the two countries.

                             Chile will never recognize the obligation to give a port to Bolivia
                         within that zone, because it was ceded to us definitively and uncon-
                         ditionally in 1904, and also, because, as I said in my note of the sixth
                         of this month, such recognition would interrupt the continuity of its
                         own territory ; however, without modifying the Treaty and leaving its
                         provisions intact and in full force and effect, there is no reason to fear
                         that the well intentioned efforts of the two Governments would not

                         maritime vindication that Your Excellency’s note suggests. I would
                         like to take this opportunity to state, once again, my Government’s
                         willingness to discuss the proposals that the Bolivian Government
                         wishes to present in this regard.”


                       40. In a press interview of 4 April 1923, the President of Chile,
                    Mr. Arturo Alessandri, made the following statement in which, notably,
                    he referred to the decision of 1922 of Peru and Chile to submit their ter-
                    ritorial dispute over Tacna and Arica to arbitration by the President of
                    the United States of America:
                             “[L]egally, we have no commitment towards Bolivia. We have had
                         our relations completely and definitively settled by the solemn faith
                         undertaken when both countries signed the Treaty of Peace and
                         Amity on 20 October 1904.
                         �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                             This Treaty, which was highly beneficial to Bolivia and gave it free
                         and perpetual access to the Pacific Ocean, was established on the
                         condition that such country renounce its right to any port claims in
                         the Pacific and Chile, the victorious country, fully paid for the terri-
                         tory that was ceded, since the pecuniary obligations imposed on Chile,
                         which have been religiously performed, represent for Chile an approx-
                         imate cost of around eight million pounds sterling.
                         �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                             Notwithstanding the foregoing, I repeat that, in case the arbitral
                         award of Washington allows it, Chile, who insists on its longing to
                         contribute all its resources to the tranquility of America, will gener-
                         ously consider the port aspirations of Bolivia in the form and terms
                         clearly and frequently posed in the Note of the Ministry of Foreign
                         Affairs of Chile, addressed to the Bolivian Minister in Chile, on
                         6 February.”
                      41. By an arbitral award of 1925, the President of the United States,
                    Mr. Calvin Coolidge, set forth the terms of the plebiscite over Tacna and
                    Arica provided for in Article 3 of the Treaty of Ancón (Tacna‑Arica
                    Question (Chile, Peru), 4 March 1925, Reports of International Arbitral
                    Awards (RIAA), Vol. II, pp. 921‑958).

                    C. The 1926 Kellogg Proposal and the 1926 Matte Memorandum
                      42. On 30 November 1926, the Secretary of State of the United States
                    of America, Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, submitted a proposal to Chile and
                    Peru, regarding the question of sovereignty over the provinces of Tacna
                    and Arica. It reads as follows :
                           “I have decided to outline and place before the two Governments
                         a plan which, in my judgment, is worthy of their earnest attention . . .





5 CIJ1150.indb 38                                                                                                                             22/05/19 10:55

                    525 	              obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                         This plan calls for the co-­operation of a third power, Bolivia, which
                         has not yet appeared in any of the negotiations, at least so far as my
                         Government is concerned. While the attitude of Bolivia has not been
                         ascertained, save that her aspiration to secure access to the Pacific is
                         common knowledge, it seems reasonable to assume that Bolivia, by
                         virtue of her geographical situation, is the one outside power which
                         would be primarily interested in acquiring, by purchase or otherwise
                         the subject matter of the pending controversy.

                            With this preface let me now define the concrete suggestion which
                         I have in mind :
                         (a) The Republics of Chile and Peru, either by joint or by several
                             instruments freely and voluntarily executed, to cede to the Repub-
                             lic of Bolivia, in perpetuity, all right, title and interest which either
                             may have in the Provinces of Tacna and Arica ; the cession to be
                             made subject to appropriate guaranties for the protection and
                             preservation, without discrimination, of the personal and prop-
                             erty rights of all of the inhabitants of the provinces of whatever
                             nationality.”
                      43. On 2 December 1926, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia
                    wrote to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America in
                    La Paz expressing Bolivia’s full acceptance of the Kellogg proposal.

                       44. By a memorandum of 4 December 1926 (the “Matte Memoran-
                    dum”) addressed to the Secretary of State of the United States of Amer-
                    ica, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile expressed his position
                    towards the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States of
                    America, in the following terms:
                           “The [R]epublic of Bolivia which 20 years after the termination of
                         the war spontaneously renounced the total sea coast, asking, as more
                         suitable for its interests, compensation of a financial nature and
                         means of communication, has expressed its desire to be considered in
                         the negotiations which are taking place to determine the nationality
                         of these territories. Neither in justice nor in equity can justification be
                         found for this demand which it formulates today as a right.

                             Nevertheless, the Government of Chile has not failed to take into
                         consideration, this new interest of the Government of Bolivia and has
                         subordinated its discussion, as was logical, to the result of the pending
                         controversy with the Government of Peru. Furthermore, in the course
                         of the negotiations conducted during the present year before the State
                         Department and within the formula of territorial division, the Gov-
                         ernment of Chile has not rejected the idea of granting a strip of ter-
                         ritory and a port to the Bolivian nation.

                    526 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                            The proposal of the Department of State goes much farther than
                         the concessions which the Chilean Government has generously been
                         able to make. It involves the definitive cession to the [R]epublic of
                         Bolivia of the territory in dispute, and, although, as the Secretary of
                         State says, this solution does not wound the dignity of the contending
                         countries and is in harmony with the desire, repeatedly shown by the
                         Chilean Government, to help satisfy Bolivian aspirations, it is no less
                         true that it signifies a sacrifice of our rights and the cession of a ter-
                         ritory incorporated for 40 years in the [R]epublic by virtue of a solemn
                         [T]reaty, a situation which cannot be juridically altered, except by a
                         plebiscite, whose result offers no doubt whatever in the opinion of the
                         Chilean people.”
                      45. Subsequently, in a Note of 7 December 1926 to the Minister Pleni-
                    potentiary of Chile in Bolivia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia
                    noted that, in his country’s view, “Chile welcome[d] the proposal issued
                    by the Secretary of State of the United States”.

                      46. Finally, by a memorandum dated 12 January 1927, the Minister
                    for Foreign Relations of Peru informed the Secretary of State of the
                    United States of America that the Peruvian Government did not accept
                    the United States’ proposal regarding Tacna and Arica.

                                 4. Bolivia’s Reaction to the 1929 Treaty of Lima
                                          and Its Supplementary Protocol
                      47. Due to difficulties arising in the execution of the 1925 arbitral
                    award between Chile and Peru concerning the terms of the plebiscite over
                    Tacna and Arica provided for in Article 3 of the Treaty of Ancón, Chile
                    and Peru agreed to resolve the issue of sovereignty over Tacna and Arica
                    by treaty rather than to hold a plebiscite to determine sovereignty.
                      48. On 3 June 1929, Chile and Peru concluded the Treaty of Lima,
                    whereby they agreed that sovereignty over the territory of Tacna belonged
                    to Peru, and that over Arica to Chile. In a Supplementary Protocol to this
                    Treaty, Peru and Chile agreed, inter alia, to the following:

                            “The Governments of Chile and Peru shall not, without previous
                         agreement between them, cede to any third Power the whole or a part
                         of the territories which, in conformity with the Treaty of this date,
                         come under their respective sovereignty, nor shall they, in the absence
                         of such an agreement, construct through those territories any new
                         international railway lines.” (Art. I.)
                       49. In a memorandum to the Secretary of State of the United States of
                    America dated 1 August 1929, upon receipt of this agreement, the Minis-
                    ter for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia affirmed that this new agreement
                    between Chile and Peru would not result in Bolivia renouncing its “policy
                    of restoration of [its] maritime sovereignty”.

                       50. In the late 1940s, Bolivia and Chile held further discussions
                    r­egarding Bolivia’s access to the sea. Notably, in a Note dated 28 June
                     1948, the Ambassador of Bolivia in Chile reported to the Minister for
                     Foreign Affairs of Bolivia his interactions with the Chilean President,
                     Mr. Gabriel González Videla, regarding the opening of these negotiations
                     and included a draft protocol containing Bolivia’s proposal.

                      51. In a Note dated 1 June 1950, the Ambassador of Bolivia to Chile
                    made the following formal proposal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                    Chile to enter into negotiations (Bolivia’s translation):

                            “With such important precedents (translated by Chile as “back‑
                         ground”), that identify a clear policy direction of the Chilean Repub-
                         lic, I have the honour of proposing to His Excellency that the
                         Governments of Bolivia and Chile formally enter into direct negoti-
                         ations to satisfy Bolivia’s fundamental need to obtain its own sover-
                         eign access to the Pacific Ocean, solving the problem of Bolivia’s
                         landlocked situation on terms that take into account the mutual ben-
                         efit and genuine interests of both nations.”


                            (“Con tan importantes antecedentes, que al respecto señalan una
                         clara orientación de la política internacional seguida por la República

                         las recíprocas conveniencias y los verdaderos intereses de ambos
                         pueblos.”)
                      52. In a Note of 20 June 1950, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                    Chile responded as follows (Chile’s translation):

                            “From the quotes contained in the note I answer, it flows that the
                         Government of Chile, together with safeguarding the de jure situation
                         established in the Treaty of Peace of 1904, has been willing to study
                         through direct efforts (translated by Bolivia as “direct negotiations”)

                         Bolivia, is open formally to enter into a direct negotiation aimed at
                         searching for a formula (translated by Bolivia as “is willing to formally
                         enter into direct negotiations aimed at finding a formula”) that would
                         make it possible to give Bolivia its own sovereign access to the Pacific
                         Ocean, and for Chile to obtain compensation of a non-­territorial
                         character which effectively takes into account its interests.”

                            (“De la citas contenidas en la nota que contesto, fluye que el

                      53. The negotiations between Chile and Bolivia did not make any fur-
                    ther progress in the following years. On 29 March 1951, the President of
                    Chile, Mr. Gabriel González Videla, stated as follows:
                            “[T]he policy of the Chilean Government has unvaryingly been a
                         single one : to express its willingness to give an ear to any Bolivian
                         proposal aimed at solving its landlocked condition, provided that it
                         is put forward directly to us and that it does not imply renouncing
                         our traditional doctrine of respect for international treaties, which we
                         deem essential for a peaceful coexistence between Nations.

                             Every time Bolivia has updated its desire for an outlet to the sea,
                         consideration was naturally given to what that country might offer us
                         as compensation in the event that an agreement is reached on this
                         particular matter with Chile and Peru.”

                                                 6. The 1961 Trucco Memorandum
                       54. From 1951 to 1957, the exchanges between the Parties were focused
                    on improving the practical implementation of the régime for Bolivia’s
                    access to the Pacific Ocean.
                       55. On 10 July 1961, upon learning about Bolivia’s intention to raise
                    the issue of its access to the Pacific Ocean during the Inter-­American
                    Conference which was to take place later that year in Quito, Ecuador,
                    Chile’s Ambassador in Bolivia, Mr. Manuel Trucco, handed to the Min-
                    ister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia a memorandum which he had earlier





5 CIJ1150.indb 46                                                                                                                             22/05/19 10:55

                    529 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                    addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, known as the
                    “Trucco Memorandum”. It reads as follows (Chile’s translation):

                           “1. Chile has always been open (translated by Bolivia as “been will‑
                         ing”), together with safeguarding the de jure situation established in
                         the Treaty of Peace of 1904, to study, in direct dealings with Bolivia,
                         the possibility of satisfying its aspirations and the interests of Chile.
                         Chile will always reject the resort, by Bolivia, to organizations which
                         are not competent to resolve a matter which is already settled by
                         Treaty and could only be modified by direct agreement (translated by
                         Bolivia as “direct negotiations”) of the parties.


                            2. Note number 9 of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated in San-
                         tiago on 20 June 1950, is a clear testimony (translated by Bolivia as
                         “clear evidence”) of those purposes. Through it, Chile states that it is
                         ‘open formally to enter into a direct negotiation aimed at searching
                         for a formula that would make it possible to give Bolivia its own
                         sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean (translated by Bolivia as
                         “expresses having ‘full consent to initiate as soon as possible, direct
                         negotiations aimed at satisfying the fundamental national need of own
                         sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean’”), and for Chile to obtain com-
                         pensation of a non‑territorial character which effectively takes into
                         account its interests.’

                           3. Given that President Paz Estenssoro manifested his willingness
                         to visit President Alessandri, in response to the invitation made by
                         the President of Chile, it would seem particularly untimely and incon-
                         venient to unsettle public opinion in both countries with the announce-
                         ment of resorting to international organizations to deal with a
                         problem that the Government of Bolivia has not specified (translated
                         by Bolivia as “has not resolved”) in its direct relations with the Gov-
                         ernment of Chile.”

                            (“1. Chile ha estado siempre llano, junto con resguardar la situ-
                         ación de derecho establecida en el Tratado de Paz de 1904, a estudiar,
                         en gestiones directas con Bolivia, la posibilidad de satisfacer las aspir-
                         aciones de ésta y los intereses de Chile. Chile rechazará siempre el
                         recurso, por parte de Bolivia, a organismos que no son competentes
                         para resolver un asunto zanjado por Tratado, y que sólo podría mod-
                         ificarse por acuerdo directo de las partes. 2. La nota No. 9 de nuestra

                         ‘llano a entrar formalmente en una negociación directa destinada a
                         buscar la fórmula que pueda hacer posible dar a Bolivia una salida

                         mente sus intereses.’ 3. Habiendo significado el Presidente Paz
                         Estenssoro su voluntad de visitar el Presidente Alessandri, en respuesta
                         a la invitación que el Presidente de Chile le formulara, pareciera espe-
                         cialmente extemporáneo e inconveniente agitar a la opinión pública
                         de ambos países con el anuncio de recurrir a organismos internacion-
                         ales para tratar de un problema que el Gobierno de Bolivia no ha
                         concretado en sus relaciones directas con el Gobierno de Chile.”)

                      56. In reply to this memorandum, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of
                    Bolivia, on 9 February 1962, expressed
                         “its full consent to initiate, as soon as possible, direct negotiations
                         aimed at satisfying the fundamental national need of its own sover-
                         eign access to the Pacific Ocean, in return for compensation that,
                         without being territorial in character, takes into account the recipro-
                         cal benefits and effective interests of both countries”.

                       57. On 15 April 1962, Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Chile
                    as a consequence of the latter’s use of waters of the River Lauca.
                       58. On 27 March 1963, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile indi-
                    cated that Chile “was not willing to enter into discussions that could
                    affect national sovereignty or involve a cession of territory of any kind”
                    and denied that the Trucco Memorandum constituted “an official note”,
                    emphasizing that it was merely an “Aide Memoire” recalling “a simple
                    statement of points of view at a certain time”. It also stated that Chile
                    had an interest in improving “all the means of transport between the two
                    countries” and had proposed to engage in a joint action of economic
                    development.
                       59. On 3 April 1963, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia main-
                    tained that the 1950 exchange of Notes was constitutive of a “commitment”
                    of the Parties, a contention rejected by Chile in a letter dated 17 November
                    1963 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia. In a Note sent by the
                    President of Bolivia, Mr. René Barrientos Ortuño, to the President of Uru-
                    guay, Mr. Oscar Diego Gestido, regarding Bolivia’s absence from the meet-
                    ing of the Heads of State of the American nations held in Punta del Este in
                    1967 and in the subsequent response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                    Chile the opposing views of Bolivia and Chile regarding the nature of the
                    exchange of Notes of 1950 were again in evidence.

                                             7. The Charaña Process
                       60. On 15 March 1974, a joint communiqué was signed by the Presi-
                    dents of Bolivia and Chile, General Banzer and General Pinochet, respec-
                    tively, expressing their agreement to initiate negotiations on “pending and
                    fundamental issues for both nations”.

                      61. On 9 December 1974, several States of Latin America, including
                    Bolivia and Chile, signed the Declaration of Ayacucho which specified,
                    regarding the Bolivian situation, that:
                            “Upon reaffirming the historic commitment to strengthen, once
                         more, the unity and solidarity between our peoples, we offer the great-
                         est understanding to the landlocked condition affecting Bolivia, a
                         situation that demands the most attentive consideration leading
                         towards constructive understanding.”
                      62. On 8 February 1975, a Joint Declaration was signed at Charaña by
                    the Presidents of Bolivia and Chile, known as the Charaña Declaration,
                    which stated, inter alia, (Bolivia’s translation):

                            “3. In this regard, the Presidents reaffirmed their full support of the
                         Declaration of Ayacucho in which the spirit of solidarity and open-
                         ness to understandings of this part of America is faithfully reflected.
                            4. Both Heads of State, within a spirit of mutual understanding and
                         constructive intent, have decided (translated by Chile as “have
                         resolved”) to continue the dialogue, at different levels, in order to
                         search for formulas (translated by Chile as “seek formulas”) to solve
                         the vital issues that both countries face, such as the landlocked situ-
                         ation that affects Bolivia, taking into account the mutual interests
                         (translated by Chile as “their reciprocal interests”) and aspirations of
                         the Bolivian and Chilean peoples.
                            5. The two Presidents have decided (translated by Chile as “have
                         resolved”) to continue developing a policy of harmony and under-
                         standing so that, in an atmosphere of co-­operation, the formulas for
                         peace and progress in the continent will be found.”

                            (“3. En este sentido, los Presidentes reafirmaron su plena adhesión
                         a la Declaración de Ayacucho, en la que se refleja fielmente un espíritu
                         solidario y abierto al entendimiento en esta parte de América.
                         4. Ambos mandatarios, con ese espíritu de mutua comprensión y
                         ánimo constructivo, han resuelto se continúe el diálogo a diversos
                         niveles, para buscar fórmulas de solución a los asuntos vitales que
                         ambos países confrontan, como el relativo a la situación de mediter-
                         raneidad que afecta a Bolivia, dentro de recíprocas conveniencias y
                         atendiendo a las aspiraciones de los pueblos boliviano y chileno.
                         5. Los dos Presidentes han resuelto seguir desarrollando una política
                         en favor de la armonía y el entendimiento, para que, en un clima de
                         cooperación se encuentre, en conjunto, una fórmula de paz y progreso
                         en nuestro Continente.”)
                      63. In a speech of 11 September 1975, the President of Chile, Gen-
                    eral Pinochet, stated that:
                         “with deep satisfaction I can note . . . the resuming of our traditional
                         links with Bolivia, which has been suspended for over 13 years. Since

                           the Charaña meeting with the President of Bolivia, we have repeated
                           our unchanging purpose of studying, together with that brother coun-
                           try, within the framework of a frank and friendly negotiation, the
                           obstacles that limit Bolivia’s development on account of its land-
                           locked condition. We trust we will find a just, timely and lasting solu-
                           tion.”
                      64. In pursuance of the “dialogue” referred to in the Joint Declaration
                    of Charaña, Bolivia proposed guidelines for negotiations on 26 August
                    1975. In December of that year, Chile presented its counter-­proposal for
                    guidelines, which included a condition of territorial exchange. It reads as
                    follows:
                          �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                         “(b) On this basis, the Chilean response is based on a mutually con-
                                venient arrangement that would take into account the interests of
                                both countries and that would not contain any innovation to the
                                provisions of the Treaty of Peace, Amity, and Commerce signed
                                between Chile and Bolivia on 20 October 1904.
                          (c) As His Excellency President Banzer stated, the cession to
                                Bolivia of a sovereign maritime coastline, linked to Bolivian terri-
                                tory through an equally sovereign territorial strip, would be
                                ­considered.
                          (d) Chile would be willing to negotiate with Bolivia the cession of a
                                 strip of territory north of Arica up to the Concordia Line based
                                 on the following delimitations :
                                — North Boundary : Chile’s current boundary with Peru.
                                — South Boundary : Gallinazos ravine and the upper edge of the
                                       ravine north of the River Lluta, (so that the A-15 highway
                                       from Arica to Tambo Quemado would in its entirety be part
                                       of Chilean territory) up until a point to the South of Puquios
                                       Station, and then an approximately straight line passing
                                       through contour 5370 of Cerro Nasahuento and extending to
                                       the current international boundary between Chile and Bolivia.
                                — Area : the cession would include the land territory described
                                       above and the maritime territory comprised between the par-
                                       allels of the end points of the coast that would be ceded (ter-
                                       ritorial sea, economical zone, and submarine shelf).

                          (f) The cession to Bolivia described in section (d) would be subject
                              to a simultaneous exchange of territories, that is to say, Chile
                              would at the same time receive in exchange for what it hands over
                              a compensatory area at least equal to the area of land and sea
                              ceded to Bolivia.

                         (n) The force of this agreement shall be conditioned upon Peru’s

                       65. Chile’s proposal was accepted by Bolivia as a basis for the negotia-
                    tions. However, in January 1976, Bolivia specified that its acceptance of
                    the condition of the territorial exchange was subject “to a clarification of
                    the maritime area, in view of the fact that the extension of internal waters,
                    territorial sea and patrimonial sea has not yet been defined by the Inter-
                    national Community” and it reserved “the right to negotiate the areas
                    that might be potentially exchanged”. In March 1976, the Minister for
                    Foreign Affairs of Bolivia recalled that Bolivia had not assumed definitive
                    commitments on this issue and declared as follows:
                            “We have categorically declared that we accept global bases of
                         negotiation that take into account the reciprocal interests of our
                         two countries, particularly as regards those matters on which there is
                         common ground between us. All other matters contained in the doc-
                         uments forming the background to the negotiations, i.e. Bolivia’s
                         proposal and the Government of Chile’s response, would be addressed
                         at a later stage of the negotiations. Consequently, we want to make
                         clear that our Government has not accepted the demilitarization of
                         the area to be handed over to Bolivia, inasmuch as it would lead to
                         a limitation of sovereignty, the use of the waters of the Lauca River
                         as a whole, or a territorial exchange that would extend over maritime
                         areas.”

                       66. By an exchange of Notes of 28 July and 11 August 1976, Chile and
                    Bolivia agreed to establish a mixed permanent commission, which was
                    created on 18 November 1976, “to discuss any issues of common interest
                    to both countries”. Throughout 1976, at several junctures, Bolivia con-
                    firmed that it was willing to consider transferring certain areas of its ter-
                    ritory for an equivalent portion of Chilean territory.

                      67. On 19 December 1975, pursuant to the guidelines for negotiations
                    and the Supplementary Protocol to the Treaty of Lima of 3 June 1929,
                    Chile asked Peru whether it agreed with the territorial cession envisaged
                    between Bolivia and Chile. In November 1976, Peru replied with a
                    counter-­proposal for the creation of an area under tripartite sovereignty,
                    which was not accepted by either Chile or Bolivia. However, Peru refused
                    to change its position on this matter.

                       68. On 24 December 1976, the President of Bolivia, General Banzer,
                    publicly announced that he “propose[d] that the Government of Chile
                    modify its proposal to eliminate the condition regarding an exchange of
                    territory” if they were to continue the negotiations. However, throughout
                    1977, the negotiations continued on the basis of the exchanges of 1975.
                    On 10 June 1977, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Chile
                    issued a Joint Declaration, stating that:

                         “[t]hey emphasize that the dialogue established via the Declaration of
                         Charaña reflects the endeavouring of the two Governments to deepen
                         and strengthen the bilateral relations between Chile and Bolivia by
                         seeking concrete solutions to their respective problems, especially
                         with regard to Bolivia’s landlocked situation. Along these lines, they
                         indicate that, consistently with this spirit, they initiated negotiations
                         aimed at finding an effective solution that allows Bolivia to count on
                         a free and sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean.

                           Taking as a basis both Ministers’ constructive analysis of the course
                         of the negotiations regarding Bolivia’s vital problem, they resolve to
                         deepen and activate their dialogue, committing to do their part to
                         bring [their] negotiation to a happy end as soon as possible.

                            Consequently, they reaffirmed the need to pursue the negotiations
                         from their current status.”
                      69. In a letter of 21 December 1977, the President of Bolivia informed
                    his Chilean counterpart that, in order to continue the negotiations, new
                    conditions should be established to achieve the objectives set by the Joint
                    Declaration of Charaña, notably that both the condition of territorial
                    exchange and Peru’s proposal for a zone of shared sovereignty between
                    the three countries should be withdrawn. In January 1978, Chile informed
                    Bolivia that the guidelines for negotiations agreed in December 1975
                    remained the foundation of any such negotiations.

                      70. On 17 March 1978, Bolivia informed Chile that it was suspending
                    diplomatic relations between them, given Chile’s lack of flexibility with
                    respect to the conditions of the negotiations and Chile’s lack of effort to
                    obtain Peru’s consent to the exchange of territory.

                         8. Statements by Bolivia and Chile at the Organization of American
                                 States and Resolutions Adopted by the Organization
                       71. On 6 August 1975, the Permanent Council of the OAS, of which
                    Bolivia and Chile are Member States, adopted by consensus resolution
                    CP/RES. 157 which stated that Bolivia’s landlocked status was a matter
                    of “concern throughout the hemisphere”, and that all American States
                    offered their co-­operation in “seeking solutions” in accordance with the
                    principles of international law and the Charter of the OAS.
                       72. This resolution was followed by 11 other resolutions, reaffirming
                    the importance of dialogue and of the identification of a solution to the
                    maritime problem of Bolivia, adopted by the General Assembly of the
                    OAS between 1979 and 1989. Chile did not vote in favour of any of the
                    11 resolutions, but did not oppose consensus on three occasions, while
                    making declarations or explanations with respect to the content and legal
                    status of the resolutions adopted.
                       73. In particular, on 31 October 1979, the General Assembly of the
                    OAS adopted resolution AG/RES. 426, which stated that it was “of con-
                    tinuing hemispheric interest that an equitable solution be found whereby
                    Bolivia [would] obtain appropriate sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean”.
                    The representative of Chile protested against the draft resolution, contest-
                    ing the jurisdiction of the General Assembly of the OAS in this matter,
                    and added in a statement of 31 October 1979 that:
                             “Consequently, Chile emphatically declares that, in accordance
                          with the legal rules indicated, this resolution does not obstruct it or
                          bind it or obligate it in any way.
                             On repeated occasions I have indicated Chile’s willingness to nego-
                          tiate a solution with Bolivia to its aspiration to have free and sover-
                          eign access to the Pacific Ocean. The way to reach that goal is direct
                          negotiation, conducted at a level of professionalism and mutual
                          respect, without any interference, suggestions or dictates from any-
                          one.
                             Once again Bolivia has rejected this way, and the path that it has
                          chosen through this resolution, in an attempt to condition and put
                          pressure on Chile, creates an insuperable obstacle to opening nego­
                          tiations that will satisfy its aspiration and duly contemplate the dig-
                          nity and sovereignty of both parties.

                            This Assembly has closed that path. It has made the possibility
                          of Bolivia obtaining satisfaction of its maritime aspiration more
                          remote.
                            As long as it insists on the path indicated by this resolution, as long
                          as it rejects the proper and logical path of free negotiations without
                          any conditions between the two countries, as long as it attempts to
                          put pressure on Chile through foreign interference, Bolivia will have
                          no outlet to the sea through Chilean territory. The responsibility will
                          not have been Chile’s.”

                       74. In 1983, the General Assembly of the OAS adopted resolution AG/
                    RES. 686. Both Bolivia and Chile took part in drafting this resolution
                    through the good offices of Colombia, which recommended a process
                    of
                         “rapprochement . . . directed toward normalizing relations [between
                         Bolivia and Chile] and overcoming the difficulties that separate
                         them — including, especially, a formula for giving Bolivia a sovereign
                         outlet to the Pacific Ocean”.

                    Chile did not oppose consensus, expressing support for the draft resolu-
                    tion, with some reservations.
                       75. In 1987 and 1988, the General Assembly of the OAS issued
                    two ­ resolutions — AG/RES. 873 and AG/RES. 930 (XVIII-0/88) —
                    expressing
                         “regret . . . that the latest talks held between Chile and Bolivia were
                         broken off, and to again urge the [S]tates directly involved in this
                         problem to resume negotiations in an effort to find a means of making
                         it possible to give Bolivia an outlet to the Pacific Ocean”.


                                      9. The “Fresh Approach” of 1986-1987
                       76. After the presidential elections in Bolivia in July 1985, new nego-
                    tiations were opened between Bolivia and Chile, within the framework of
                    what was called the “fresh approach”. In November 1986, the renewal of
                    Bolivia and Chile’s negotiations was reported to the General Assembly of
                    the OAS which took note of it with the adoption of resolution AG/
                    RES. 816. On 13 November 1986, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of
                    Bolivia and Chile each issued a communiqué in which they stated that
                    they were to carry out the talks, initiated that year, in a meeting sched-
                    uled in April 1987. In his communiqué, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                    of Bolivia specified that they were to consider “the aspects related to the
                    maritime issue of Bolivia”.
                       77. The meeting held between 21 and 23 April 1987 in Montevideo,
                    Uruguay, between the Parties was opened by speeches of the Ministers
                    for Foreign Affairs of Chile and Bolivia. During this meeting, Bolivia
                    presented two alternative proposals to gain access to the Pacific Ocean,
                    both involving the transfer of a part of Chilean territory. The first pro-
                    posal involved the sovereign transfer to Bolivia of a strip of land linked
                    to the maritime coast and the second one proposed the transfer of a “ter-
                    ritorial and maritime enclave in the north of Chile”, with three different
                    alternative locations that would not “affect the territorial continuity of
                    Chile”. On 9 June 1987, Chile rejected both proposals. On 17 June, before
                    the General Assembly of the OAS, the representative of Bolivia announced
                    the suspension of bilateral negotiations between the two States as a con-





5 CIJ1150.indb 62                                                                                  22/05/19 10:55

                    sequence of their inability to reach agreement based on its proposals of
                    April 1987. By a resolution of 14 November 1987, the General Assembly
                    of the OAS recorded the discontinuance of the talks between Chile and
                    Bolivia.

                                       10. The Algarve Declaration (2000)
                                         and the 13‑Point Agenda (2006)
                       78. In 1995, the Parties resumed their discussions. They launched a
                    “Bolivian-­ Chilean mechanism of Political Consultation” to deal with
                    bilateral issues. On 22 February 2000, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of
                    both countries issued a joint communiqué, the “Algarve Declaration”,
                    envisaging a working agenda which would include “without any excep-
                    tion, the essential issues in the bilateral relationship”.

                      79. From 2000 to 2003, the Parties engaged in discussions regarding a
                    Chilean concession to Bolivia for the creation of a special economic zone
                    for an initial time period of 50 years, but the project was finally rejected
                    by Bolivia. On 1 September 2000, the Presidents of Bolivia and Chile,
                    General Banzer and Mr. Lagos, issued a joint communiqué in which they
                    “reiterated . . . the willingness of their Governments to engage in a dia-
                    logue on all issues concerning their bilateral relations”.

                       80. Following different exchanges throughout 2005 and 2006, on
                    17 July 2006, the Vice‑Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Chile
                    publicly announced a 13‑Point Agenda, encompassing “all issues relevant
                    to the bilateral relationship” between the Parties, including the “maritime
                    issue” (Point 6). The topics included in the 13‑Point Agenda, notably the
                    question of the maritime issue, were discussed in the subsequent meetings
                    of the Bolivian-­Chilean mechanism of Political Consultation until 2010.

                       81. In 2009 and 2010, the creation of a Bolivian enclave on the Chilean
                    coast was discussed between the Parties. In January 2011, the Parties
                    agreed to continue the discussions with the establishment of a High Level
                    Bi-­National Commission.
                       82. On 7 February 2011, the Bolivian and Chilean Ministers for For-
                    eign Affairs issued a Joint Declaration stating that:
                           “The High Level Bi-­National Commission examined the progress
                         of the Agenda of the 13 Points, especially the maritime issue . . . The
                         Ministers of Foreign Affairs have also set out future projects which,
                         taking into account the sensitivity of both Governments, will aim at
                         reaching results as soon as possible, on the basis of concrete, feasible,
                         and useful proposals for the whole of the agenda.”

                      83. On 17 February 2011, the President of Bolivia, Mr. Morales,
                    requested “a concrete proposal by 23 March [2011] . . . as a basis for a

                    538 	        obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                    discussion”. During a meeting on 28 July 2011, the President of Chile,
                    Mr. Piñera, reiterated to his Bolivian counterpart, Mr. Morales, the terms
                    of his proposal based on the three following conditions: the compliance
                    with the 1904 Peace Treaty, the absence of grant of sovereignty and the
                    modification of the provision of the Bolivian Constitution referring to the
                    right of Bolivia to an access to the Pacific Ocean. Given the divergent
                    positions of the Parties, the negotiations came to an end, as the state-
                    ments of 7 June 2011 of the Heads of the Bolivian and Chilean Legation
                    before the General Assembly of the OAS show.

                    Application, Bolivia has requested the Court to adjudge and declare that
                    “Chile has the obligation to negotiate with Bolivia in order to reach an
                    agreement granting Bolivia a fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean”.
                       86. While States are free to resort to negotiations or put an end to
                    them, they may agree to be bound by an obligation to negotiate. In that
                    case, States are required under international law to enter into negotia-
                    tions and to pursue them in good faith. As the Court recalled in the North
                    Sea Continental Shelf cases, States “are under an obligation so to conduct
                    themselves that the negotiations are meaningful, which will not be the
                    case when either of them insists upon its own position without contem-
                    plating any modification” (I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85). Each of
                    them “should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other” (Appli‑
                    cation of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav
                    Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (II),
                    p. 685, para. 132).
                       87. Negotiations between States may lead to an agreement that settles
                    their dispute, but, generally, as the Court observed quoting the Advisory
                    Opinion on Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland (P.C.I.J.,
                    Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116), “an obligation to negotiate does not imply an
                    obligation to reach an agreement” (Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay
                    (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68,
                    para. 150). When setting forth an obligation to negotiate, the parties may,
                    as they did for instance in Article VI of the Treaty on the Non‑Prolifera-
                    tion of Nuclear Weapons, establish an “obligation to achieve a precise
                    result” (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opin‑
