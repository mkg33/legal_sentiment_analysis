of Treaties reflect international customary law on the subject.

Text of Article IV of the 1891 Convention — Clause providing “From
4° 10’ north latitude on the east coast the boundary-line shall be continued east-
ward along that parallel, across the Island of Sebittik . . .” — Ambiguity of the
terms “shall be continued” and “across” — Ambiguity which could have been
avoided had the Convention expressly stipulated that the 4° 10° north parallel
constituted the line separating the islands under British sovereignty from those
under Dutch sovereignty — Ordinary meaning of the term “boundary”.

Context of the 1891 Convention — Explanatory Memorandum appended to
the draft Law submitted to the Netherlands States-General with a view to rati-
fication of the Convention — Map appended to the Memorandum shows a red
line continuing out to sea along the 4° 10’ north parallel — Line cannot be con-
sidered to have been extended in order to settle any dispute in the waters beyond
Sebatik — Explanatory Memorandum and map never transmitted by the Dutch
Government to the British Government but simply forwarded to the latter by its



diplomatic agent in The Hague — Lack of reaction by the British Government
to the line cannot be deemed to constitute acquiescence.

Object and purpose of the Convention — Delimitation solely of the parties’
possessions within the island of Borneo.

Article IV of the Convention, when read in context and in the light of the
Convention's object and purpose, cannot be interpreted as establishing an allo-
cation line determining sovereignty over the islands out to sea, to the east of
Sebatik.

Recourse to supplementary means of interpretation in order to seek a possible
confirmation of the Court's interpretation of the text of the Convention —
Neither travaux préparatoires of the Convention nor circumstances of its con-
clusion support the position of Indonesia.

Subsequent practice of the parties — 1915 Agreement between Great Britain
and the Netherlands concerning the boundary between the State of North Bor-
neo and the Dutch possessions on Borneo reinforces the Court's interpretation
of the 1891 Convention — Court cannot draw any conclusion from the other
documents cited.

Maps produced by the Parties — With the exception of the map annexed to
the 1915 Agreement, cartographic material inconclusive in respect of the inter-
pretation of Article IV.

Court ultimately comes to the conclusion that Article IV determines the
boundary between the two Parties up to the eastern extremity of Sebatik Island
and does not establish any allocation line further eastwards.

Disputed islands not mentioned by name in any of the international legal
instruments cited — Islands not included in the 1878 grant by which the Sultan
of Sulu ceded all his rights and powers over his possessions in Borneo to
Alfred Dent and Baron von Overbeck — Court observes that, while the Parties
both maintain that Ligitan and Sipadan were not terrae nullius during the period
in question in the present case, they do so on the basis of diametrically opposed
reasoning, each of them claiming to hold title to those islands.

Malaysia's argument that it was successor to the Sultan of Sulu, the original
title-holder to the disputed islands, further to a series of alleged transfers of that
title to Spain, the United States, Great Britain on behalf of the State of North
Borneo, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia cannot be upheld.

Consideration of the effectivités relied on by the Parties.
Effectivités generally scarce in the case of very small islands which are
uninhabited or not permanently inhabited, like Ligitan and Sipadan — Court



primarily to analyse the effectivités which date from the period before 1969, the
year in which the Parties asserted conflicting claims to Ligitan and Sipadan —
Nature of the activities to be taken into account by the Court in the present
case.

Effectivités relied on by Indonesia — Activities which do not constitute acts a
titre de souverain reflecting the intention and will to act in that capacity.

Effectivités relied on by Malaysia — Activities modest in number but diverse
in character, covering a considerable period of time and revealing an intention to
exercise State functions in respect of the two islands — Neither the Netherlands
nor Indonesia ever expressed its disagreement or protest at the time when these
activities were carried out — Malaysia has title to Ligitan and Sipadan on the
basis of the effectivités thus mentioned.
