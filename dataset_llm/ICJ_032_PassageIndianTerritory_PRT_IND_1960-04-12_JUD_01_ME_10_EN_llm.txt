I greatly regret that I cannot agree with the Judgment of the
Court on certain important issues, though I do agree with certain
of its conclusions.

As to the Fifth and Sixth Preliminary Objections of the Republic
of India to the jurisdiction of the Court, I agree that these cannot
be sustained.

On the merits I agree: that Portugal in 1954 had acquired by
local custom a right of passage to the extent necessary for the
exercise of Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves, subject
however to the regulation and control of India, which right extended
at least to the passage of private persons, Portuguese civil officials
and goods in general.

I am unable, however, to agree that no right of passage had
been acquired by it in respect of armed forces or armed police or
arms and ammunition, or that India did not act contrary to its
obligation resulting from the right of passage which the Court has
found to have been acquired by Portugal. I shall state my reasons.

I do not think it necessary to determine whether, under the
Treaty of Punem and the Sanads of 1783 and 1785, sovereignty over
the enclaves became vested in Portugal. Whatever was the precise
nature of the grant made thereunder, even if it were one in jagr or
saranjam, merely fiscal in character and unilaterally revocable at
any time in the absolute discrétion of the Marathas, the grant
whilst it endured necessarily implied some right of passage in
Portugal between Daman and the villages of Dadra and Nagar-
Aveli, and the record establishes that during the Maratha period
it did imply a right of passage which, for all practical purposes,
was under the circumstances then existent, in substance the same
as would have resulted had the grant been one of sovereignty over
these villages.

In order to determine whether Portugal acquired by custom any
right of passage and, if so, the nature and extent of the same, it is
necessary to examine the practice which was from time to time
followed.

The proper way of measuring the nature and extent of any such
custom, if established, is to have regard to the practice which itself
both defines and limits it. The first element in a custom is a constant
and uniform practice which must be determined before a custom
can be defined.

The record in my opinion establishes:

1. For the first two or three decades after 1818 there was no
essential change in the practice in relation to passage which had
been followed during the Maratha period.

2. The British—as subsequently did the Republic of India—
recognized Portuguese sovereignty over the enclaves.

This is established beyond all reasonable controversy. The conduct
of the British and India is wholly inconsistent with any other
conclusion. The record is heavy with instances of this recognition.

India to Portugal of 1950 and 1953, seeking the transfer by Portugal
to India of all the former’s possessions in India, in themselves
provide powerful evidence of India’s recognition.

During the oral hearing, on 12 October, Counsel for India admitted
the existence of Portuguese sovereignty. At a later date, on 29 Oc-
tober, when Counsel for Portugal put the following question
“Does India admit that Portuguese sovereignty still subsists”, it
was not disputed by India that Portugal still had sovereignty over
the enclaves.

As between the Parties to and for the purposes of this dispute,
Portugal’s sovereignty is not open to question.

This recognition of sovereignty in Portugal, both by the British
and India, is in my view the central fact in this dispute.


I00 RIGHT OF PASSAGE (Diss. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

3. Despite the closest regulation and control from time to time
of many aspects of passage, the constant and uniform practice of
the British was to allow passage in respect of all six categories
mentioned in the Judgment of the Court to an extent which was
at least sufficient to enable Portugal continuously to administer the
enclaves.

The Court holds, and I agree, that the practice followed during
the British period and continued during that of India, resulted in
Portugal acquiring by local custom a right of passage in respect of
private persons, civil officials and goods. It is my opinion, however,
that the practice resulted in a custom by virtue of which Portugal
acquired a right of passage not only in respect of these categories,
but also in respect of armed forces, armed police, and arms and
ammunition.

Movement of members of the armed forces passing between
Daman and the enclaves was, at least after the middle of the
nineteenth century, not very great. They appear to have dis-
charged in the main strictly police functions. The numbers who
exercised passage at any given time were small. Their func-
tions related primarily to the maintenance of internal order
within the enclaves ; passage between Daman and the enclaves, and
between the latter, was largely, if not principally, in relation to
relief of detachments, posting or re-posting, proceeding on leave,
escorting government funds or prisoners and other duties of a
police character. The movement of armed police presents a some-
what similar picture.

The constant and uniform practice during the British period was
to permit under regulation and control the passage of members of
the armed forces and police officials and arms and ammunition.
There appears never to have been an occasion when this passage
was not permitted.

In 1947 India succeeded the British as sovereign over the inter-
vening territory. From that time onwards, until shortly before July
1954, when the events arose from which this dispute stems, the
practice which had been followed during the British period was
continued.

*
* *

The right of passage claimed by Portugal is an indivisible one
which was, however, in its exercise subject to regulation and control


TOI RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

by India. Portugal did not claim one right of passage for goods,
another for private individuals and a separate one for each of the
six categories into which, for the purposes of the Court’s Judgment,
the passage has been divided.

This, however, presents no difficulty so long as the indivisible
character of the claim made by Portugal is kept constantly in
mind. Unless, however, this is done, distinctions in degree between
the regulation and control of passage exercised by the British and
later by India, on different occasions and from time to time in
respect of one or some of these different categories, may lead to
impermissible conclusions as to the nature and extent of the right
itself.

In reaching its conclusion that Portugal did not have in July 1954
any right of passage in respect of armed forces, armed police or
arms and ammunition, the Court has pursued certain distinctions
which it sees between one set of categories and another; which in
my opinion are but distinctions of degrees of regulation and control;
and has treated these distinctions as decisive. This has led it to
reach one conclusion in respect of what may conveniently be de-
scribed as the first three categories and an opposite one in respect
of the other three.

There cannot be any real dispute that it was the constant and
uniform practice during the British and post-British periods to
permit passage in respect of all six categories.

Each of these categories was at different times subject to different
regulation and control. The passage of private persons and civil
officials was, until just prior to the events which occurred at Dadra,
subject to routine control, although the frontier controls included
during one period, 1857-1863, the prohibition of entry without a
licence of all foreigners; during the first World War the reporting
by Portuguese Europeans to the police on arrival in Indian territory;
and from 1935 the requirement of all Portuguese not domiciled in
India to carry a passport when entering Indian territory from a
Portuguese possession over the land frontier (Counter-Memorial,
para. 46). The passage of goods in general was subject at certain
times to customs regulation and such regulation and control as
was necessitated by considerations of security or revenue. Indeed,
India’s case was that the passage of goods was “subject at all times
to control and on occasion even to prohibitions” (para. 358 of
Rejoinder).



In respect of the first three categories, these controls did not
preclude the Court from finding that a custom had arisen creating
a right of passage as at July 1954, which right was itself subject
to the regulation and control by India. This finding, as I read the
Court’s decision, depended on the fact that in respect of private
persons and civil officials there was no restriction beyond routine
control, whilst in respect of goods in general, despite certain pro-
hibitions referred to in the Court’s Judgment, in all other cases
the passage of goods was free, “no authorization or licence was
required”.

It is in the absence or presence of any need to obtain prior
permission or licence for passage. in respect of any category that
the Court finds a decisive distinction between the first three cate-
gories and the other three.

When, therefore, the Court turns to consider whether any right
of passage has been established in respect of armed forces, armed
police and arms and ammunition, its decision in respect of them is
based upon a preliminary finding that in this respect the position
as regards these three categories is clearly different.

It is then for consideration in what material respects, if any, it
was different, and whether any difference established is decisive.

Firstly, the difference is stated to lie in the fact that from 1818
to 1878, the passage of armed forces and armed police between
British and Portuguese possessions was regulated on a basis of
general reciprocity.

It-is not apparent in what way this difference can be decisive.
Reciprocal arrangements between the British and the Portuguese
were not confined to the passage of armed forces and armed police
between their respective possessions; there were, during certain
periods, some reciprocal arrangements which also covered the
passage of certain goods, between specifically Daman and the
enclaves, free from customs or transit duties (see e.g. Indian Annex
C. No. 35; Counter-Memorial, Vol. II, Indian Annexes at pp. 134,
145, 149, 158, 163, 170, 177; Rejoinder, Vol. II, Indian Annexes
at p. 293).

It needs to be constantly stressed that we are concerned not
with the matter of general entry by British or Portuguese armed
forces or armed police into the possessions of the other, but with
the special case of passage between Daman and the enclaves. To the
extent to which the general covers the specific, the regulation of
entry and transit on the basis of reciprocity is quite consistent
with the right claimed by Portugal, consistent with freedom of

to any entry into or over British or Indian territory.

Secondly, the Court finds that after 1878 the position was that
passage could only take place with the previous authorization of
the British, and later of India, whether under a reciprocal arrange-
ment already agreed to or in individual cases, whereas, in the case
of private persons, civil officials and goods in general, no previous
authorization was required.

On the basis of these preliminary findings, the conclusion is
reached that “having regard to the special circumstances of the
case” the necessity for authorization before passage could take
Place constitutes a negation of passage as of right in respect of
armed forces and armed police. This in the Court’s view predicates
that the territorial sovereign had the absolute and arbitrary power
to refuse or withdraw permission at any time.

It is not evident what these special circumstances are.

India submitted that the essence of a right of passage is the power
to pass without permission; that the need for prior permission or
licence negates any right.

It does not appear to what extent, if at all, this proposition, which,
in my opinion is, as stated, unsound, has been accepted. If it be that
in this case the necessity for authorization before passage took
place constitutes a negation of passage as of right solely because of
certain special circumstances, it is important to know what those
special circumstances are. I assume the Court is referring to the
preliminary findings of fact just mentioned, which in my view do
not support its decision. No other special circumstances have been
suggested, and I am not aware of any.

With regard to arms and ammunition, the Court’s decision appears
to turn wholly on the finding that since 1878 the importation or
exportation of the same has been subject to prior permission or
licence. This seems to disregard as unimportant the practice which
had been followed from 1818 to 1878.

TOI

applied for, there were a number of occasions when members of the
Portuguese armed forces passed between Daman and the enclaves
without seeking or having any prior permission to do so. The
Portuguese claim that these occasions numbered twenty-three.
Whatever the precise number, it is quite clear on the record that
there were several (Indian Annex F. No. 53, Rejoinder, Vol. II, at
pages 212, 213, 214, 216, 218, 219 and 220).

This gave rise in I890 and 1891 to correspondence which passed
between the British and the Portuguese authorities in which the
former took up the position that, by virtue of Article XVIII of the
Treaty, formal request for permission should in all cases be made
whenever any Portuguese armed forces passed through British
territory. Whether the provisions of Article XVIII justified the
construction then placed upon it by the British authorities is a
question which need not be answered. The fact is that thereafter it
became a habit for the Portuguese to apply for prior permission.
This marked a point of departure in respect of the administrative
practice which had prevailed before 1878.

I02


In reaching its conclusion as to the practice with regard to the
passage of armed forces, the Court appears to have been much
persuaded by letter of the 22nd December 1890 from the Gover-
nor General of Portuguese India to the Governor of Bombay (Indian
Annex F. No. 53, Rejoinder, Vol. II, at page 215) and the Treaty of
1741 between the Marathas and the Portuguese. On examination,
however, these I think provide slender support for its conclusion.

On 8 December 1890 the Bombay Government communicated
with the Portuguese Government in India to the effect that “armed
men in the service of the Portuguese Government are in the habit of
passing without formal request” between Daman and Nagar-Aveli
and that this appeared in breach of Article XVIII of the Treaty of
1878. It was to this legal contention that the Governor General of
Portuguese India replied on 22 December, in which inter alia he
stated: “On so delicate a subject I request leave to observe that
Portuguese troops never cross British territory without previous
permission and that small detachments whenever on the march meet
a military post or any force or British Authority, they halt and
only proceed further after applying for and obtaining fresh permis-
sion. For centuries has this practice been followed, whereby the
treaties have been respected and due deference shown to the British
authorities.” The Bombay Government replied by letter of 9 April
1891 in which it stated that application for permission, claimed to
be necessary under the terms of Article XVIII of the Treaty, had

‘not been observed in several instances. It was, however, made quite
clear that permission, when applied for in respect to Portuguese
armed men, “would be accorded in consonance with past practice”.
(Rejoinder, Vol. II, Indian Annexes at page 223.)

Whatever the precise meaning to be given to the statement in the
letter of the Portuguese Governor General it is, I think, apparent on
the reading of the relevant correspondence that:

(a) The request for permission was treated very much as a for-
mality, though a not unimportant one. The “formal request’ under
Article XVIII of the Treaty had first to be made.

(b) When permission was applied for, it would be forthcoming
“in consonance with past practice”.

That this letter of the Portuguese Governor General cannot be
accepted as establishing that the practice which had existed prior
to 1878 in relation to passage of armed forces between Daman and
the enclaves was to seek for and obtain permission or that prior
permission was necessary is, I think, reasonably clear elsewhere in
the record.

On 27 February 1950 the Government of India approached the
Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the view that Portugal
should agree to the integration of her territories in the Indian
Peninsula within the Republic of India. It sought the acceptance


III RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

of this principle by Portugal, leaving to be discussed the ways and
means to give it effect.

By Memorandum dated 15 June 1950, Portugal made it clear that
the transfer of any Portuguese territory could not be considered.

On receipt of this Memorandum the Indian Minister in Portugal
stated that his Government could not accept the Portuguese refusal
of India’s proposal as a final disposition of the question or acquiesce
in the continuance of the existing position.

On 14 January 1953, the Indian Government addressed a further
Note on the same subject to the Government of Portugal. It asked
that the principle of direct transfer should be accepted first and
that this should be followed by a de facto transfer of the administra-
tion. “No longer ... is it compatible with the status of India ... that
pockets of foreign territory, however small in area ... should
continue to exist on Indian soil...” “The Government of India has
come to the conclusion that no solution is now possible except on
the basis of a direct transfer which would ensure the merger of
these territories at an early date with the Indian Union.”

On 1 May 1953, Portugal having refrained from replying to this
renewed request and having refused to discuss the question of a
direct transfer with the Indian Chargé d’Affaires, India, by Note of
this date, notified Portugal that unless it was prepared to discuss
the question of direct transfer, it proposed to close its Legation in
Lisbon. The Note stressed again the Government of India’s view
that Portuguese possessions should become an integral part of the
territory of the Union of India.

Portugal, on 15 May 1953, replied to both the preceding Notes.
It adhered to its refusal to discuss India’s request, and asked India
to reconsider its intention to close its Legation.

_ On 26 May 1953 India notified Portugal that its Legation would
be closed from 11 June 1953.

In October 1953 India prohibited the transit of armed Portuguese
police or military personnel across Indian territory.

On 2 December 1953 the Portuguese Legation at New Delhi, by
Note to India’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, stated that information
had been received that Indian authorities had as from 26 November
1953 forbidden the transit of the Governor of Daman District, of
the European officials and the car of the Portuguese police through
Indian territory between Daman and Nagar-Aveli unless provided
with passports and Indian visas. The Portuguese Note stated that it
would “hamper administration of the said territories’; it was felt
that the measure was unfriendly.


I12 RIGHT OF PASSAGE (D1ss. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

This complaint was referred to in an Indian Note of 23 December
1953. India stated that it had been compelled to review its policy in
view of the “general unfriendly attitude’ of the Portuguese and the
“misuse” of concessions hitherto enjoyed by Portuguese officials.
However, to facilitate the administration of Nagar-Aveli the
District Magistrates at Surat were ‘‘as a very special case” authori-
zed to grant transit visas to permanent Portuguese European
officials of Daman and Silvassa but no further concession could be
considered. This practice as applied to transit bétween Daman and
Nagar-Aveli was, I think, an innovation (see Annexes 35 and 39 to
Portuguese Memorial, and Indian Annexes E. 51 and 52). It was
the subject of further protests on the part of the Portuguese, on
18 January 1954 and II February 1954 (Annexes 39 and 40 to
Memorial). The Note of 18 January (para. 4) stated that “the
Governors of Daman, as well as the other officials of the district,
including the Europeans, had always been allowed, by custom and
tradition, to cross Indian territory between Daman and Nagar-
Aveli … without any formalities of visas or of presenting themselves
to the Indian authorities”.

On 3 February 1954, with immediate effect, trans-shipment
through India from and to the Portuguese possessions in India
of arms and ammunition of all categories was prohibited. The pro-
hibition extended also to Portuguese civil and military personnel,
excepting only the Governor-General of Goa and diplomatic and
career consular officials accredited to the Government of India
(Annex 45 to Memorial).

* *

We now come to the events which occurred at Dadra and Nagar-
Aveli.

It is, I think, important to consider those which took place at
Nagar-Aveli separately from those at Dadra. India has throughout
this case dealt with the two series of events as in substance one
occurrence. There was of course an interconnection between them
but they were quite separate occurrences.

On the evening of 21 July 1954 a band of men entered Dadra from
Indian territory for the purpose of taking over the administration
there. A mélée ensued. Two Portuguese officers were killed. Portu-
guese resistance was overcome and its control displaced.

On 13 June 1954, the transit of vehicles between Daman and
the enclaves had been interrupted by the Indian authorities.
On 17 July 1954, India ‘decided to make certain changes in the

IIO

II3 RIGHT OF PASSAGE (Diss. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

concessions hitherto granted to the Portuguese administration
at Daman and Nagar-Aveli” with immediate effect. A number
of new restrictions were imposed, the most important of which
was that “‘the transport of firearms, and ammunition and military
stores by a Portuguese officer, or intended for the Portuguese
India Government, passing through Indian territory, will be
prohibited”. On the day preceding 21 July the Governor of Daman,
proceeding to Dadra, was prevented from crossing the border.
The Indian explanation is that he had merely been asked to
submit certain clarifications regarding his return visa, that he had
refused to give them and said he would obtain separate visas for
the outward and return journeys. This he did, and he passed through
to Dadra on 21 July. At the same time, on 20 July 1954, a bus on
the regular service between Daman and Nagar-Aveli was forced to
return when it was nearing Dadra.

It is stated by India that “in April 1954 the position in regard to
travel between Portuguese possessions and India was that Goans
who were not in the service of the Portuguese Government could
enter Indian territory without formalities and freely move within
it; and that Indian nationals also could enter the Portuguese
possessions without requirement of passport and visa, but were
required to report to the police authorities within a certain time of
arrival and were subject to inspection of identity certificates.
Portuguese Europeans and Portuguese native subjects who were in
the service of the Portuguese Government were required to produce
‘Guias’ or passports having a visa for entry in or transit through
India. There was no ban on such entry or transit right up to the date of
the insurrection in Dadra. The day before the insurrection in Dadra,
that is, on 21 July 1954, the Governor of Daman had been allowed
to enter Indian territory and proceed to Dadra and to complete the
return journey on the strength of visas granted by ‘the Indian
Government. After the insurrection in Dadra, the Indian Government
ceased to grant visas to Portuguese Europeans or to native subjects in
the service of the Portuguese Government wishing to go to Dadra and
Nagar-Aveli.” (Indian Counter-Memorial, para. 211.)

On 26 July the Portuguese Government requested that delegates
of the Governor of Daman (if necessary limited to three) should be
permitted to go to Nagar-Aveli in order to enter into contact with
the population, examine the situation and take the necessary
measures on the spot. The request stated that if possible this
delegation would also visit Dadra and examine the situation there.
It mentioned that the delegation could be routed directly to Nagar-
Aveli from Daman and need not necessarily pass through Dadra.
This request was refused (Annex 52 to Memorial).



This was prior to any occurrences in Nagar-Aveli, It was not
until 20 July that the first event which led during August to the
overthrow of Portuguese authority in Nagar-Aveli occurred. Up to
29 July conditions within Nagar-Aveli were normal.

From the time of the events in Dadra and thenceforward the
passage of all Portuguese civil officials or employees to either of the
enclaves was banned. All passage was refused. In my opinion the
banning of all transit by and the stopping of all further visas to
Portuguese civil officials, whether native or European, followed by
the refusal to permit the passage of these few delegates—the refusal
of all passage to the enclaves—was in breach of India’s international
obligation in relation to Portugal's right of passage, unless it can be
excused as within the qualification to Portugal’s right which per-
mitted India to regulate and control its exercise.

*
* +

India contends that to have granted passage could have resulted
in increased tensions and could have led to undesirable conse-
quences.

It is relevant to observe that India did not purport in any way to
regulate and control any right of Portugal to passage. Her attitude
is that no such right existed.

If India had in fact purported to regulate and control Portugal’s
right of passage, it would have been relevant to enquire whether
the action taken by India was in reality a regulation or control of
the right of passage, or was directed to another and different
purpose. It would have been relevant to enquire whether it was in
fact directed to control and regulation as such, or whether it was
directed to the right of passage as such so as to render it nugatory.
India cannot be in any better position in this case than she would
have been had she purported to have regulated and controlled
Portugal’s right of passage.

In my opinion, the key to the question whether its actions were
or were not a breach of its obligation to conduct itself in consonance
with the international right acquired by Portugal, is to be found in
the conduct of India and the series of progressive restrictions on
passage imposed by it since 1953. The refusal to grant visas to any
civil officials after the incursion into Dadra and the refusal to permit
the passage to Nagar-Aveli of but a few delegates of the Governor
of Daman cannot be seen in isolation. They were part of the pattern
already formed by the past.

An examination of the evidence forces me to the conclusion that
the dominant purpose of India immediately after the events at
Dadra, to which all other considerations were subordinated, was to

II12

IIS RIGHT OF PASSAGE (DISS. OPIN. OF SIR PERCY SPENDER)

exclude the Portuguese thenceforth from any further access to the
enclaves. For reasons unconnected with any question of regulation
or control of passage as such or of any right of passage, it was not
prepared to permit civil officials or any organ of Government to -
pass to the enclaves under any circumstances and acted accordingly.
By India’s actions Nagar-Aveli became isolated from the Portuguese
authorities at Daman before the events which occurred there had
taken place, and has, in the events which have happened, continued
to be so ever since.

The qualification of Portugal's right making it in its exercise
subject to India’s control and regulation affords in the circumstances
no protection to India. Breach of its international obligation has
been established. In my opinion the Court should have so found
and should then have proceeded to consider the resulting situation,
and the contentions advanced by India to the effect that any
obligations with regard to passage binding on it in July 1954 should
be regarded as having lapsed or become unenforceable against it
as a result of events and circumstances which have since occurred.
