 1. Having already voiced my dissent to the 24 May 2007 Judgment on
e preliminary objections, I particularly wanted to start by setting out
y reservations on a question which I believe to be of undisputed legal
 nificance in international judicial law, concerning a Court practice
hich has become an established procedural principle — as consistently
nfirmed by the Court in its jurisprudence — but which was seemingly
 andoned in its 2007 Judgment in this case. I am referring to the pre-
ndition to any seisin of the Court by unilateral application : there must
, particularly for the exercise of diplomatic protection, a dispute between
e States concerned, that is, the State of origin of the individual whose
 hts are alleged to have been violated, and the receiving State, the per-
trator of the alleged internationally wrongful acts.
 2. I was concerned at the time, in a purely legal interest, that this
ould mark the start of an unjustified U-turn in the jurisprudence in this
ea ; the fact that States have since continued to adhere to this require-
ent (see, in particular, paras. 3.17-3.22 of Russia’s preliminary objec-
 ns in the case concerning Application of the International Convention
  the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v.
 ssian Federation)), is encouragement for me to recall the merits of the
 inion I expressed at that time. As I had already pointed out in my


parate opinion to the Judgment on the preliminary objections, the dip-
matic practice is well-established : all international litigation, even if it
 ates to the facts of a situation covered by a bilateral agreement, is
ways preceded by “diplomatic representations”, which are not to be
nfused with exhaustion of local remedies. On this point the jurispru-
nce has likewise been well-established since the Judgment of the Per-
anent Court in the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case, which
fines a dispute as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict
 legal views or of interests” (Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A,
o. 2, p. 11).
 A dispute develops when a conflict arises between the arguments
 vanced by the parties in respect of an act considered by one of them as
 ongful ; legally, it is this dispute, rather than the act itself, which forms
e subject-matter of the proceedings, and it is through the dispute that
e Court will take cognizance of the facts (case concerning Ahmadou
 dio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo),
 eliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), pp. 636-
 4).
 3. In fact, from the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case to that
  Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application :
02) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), in 2006, the Court’s
 sition remained unchanged, until the Judgment on the preliminary
 jections in the present case. In that Judgment, the Court found that it
 s entitled to entertain Guinea’s Application without first having esta-
 shed that the acts allegedly suffered by Mr. Diallo at the hands of the
ongo, besides being unlawful, had given rise to an inter-State dispute
tween Guinea and the Congo, the only circumstance under which any
ch act can be referred to the Court by means of an application. In so
 ing, the Court acted as though this requirement would no longer have
 be satisfied, which would have constituted a complete about-turn in a
 isprudence which had never previously been contested.

 dition, that this requirement is still a precondition to the proper refer-
  of any matter to the Court (para. 3.17) ; in the case concerning the
uclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), the Court states the following :


      “The Court, as a court of law, is called upon to resolve existing
   disputes between States. Thus the existence of a dispute is the pri-
   mary condition for the Court to exercise its judicial function ; it is
   not sufficient for one party to assert that there is a dispute, since
   ‘whether there exists an international dispute is a matter for objec-
   tive determination’ by the Court” (Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v.
   France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 476, para. 58, citing


   Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Rom-
   ania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).

adds there: :
     “Article 38 of the Court’s Statute provides that its function is ‘to
   decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are sub-
   mitted to it’ ; but not only Article 38 itself but other provisions of the
   Statute and Rules also make it clear that the Court can exercise its
   jurisdiction in contentious proceedings only when a dispute genu-
   inely exists between the parties . . .” (Ibid., p. 477, para. 60 ; emphasis
   added.)
 When the Order was made on the indication of provisional measures in
e Georgia v. Russian Federation case, seven judges expressed their
ared view in a joint dissenting opinion. In asserting that the disputed
nvention prescribes negotiated settlement ahead of any recourse to the
ourt, they confirm the requirement that there must be a dispute between
e parties relating to the interpretation or application of the said con-
ntion (case concerning Application of the International Convention on
e Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Rus-
 n Federation), Provisional Measures, Order of 15 October 2008, joint
 senting opinion of Judges Al-Khasawneh, Ranjeva, Shi, Koroma,
 mka, Bennouna and Skotnikov, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 401, para. 6).

The Judges object that :
   “[m]oreover, . . . unable to find any evidence that the acts alleged
   by Georgia fall within the provisions of CERD, [the majority] has
   been content to observe merely that a dispute appears to exist as to
   the interpretation and application of CERD because the two Parties
   have manifested their disagreement over the applicability of Arti-
   cles 2 and 5 of the Convention.” (Ibid., p. 402, para. 10.)
 ereby contesting the fact that “an argument expounded during oral
oceedings has mutated into evidence of the existence of a dispute
tween the Parties” (ibid., p. 402, para. 10).
The seven judges observe, nevertheless, that
   “[t]he Court . . . admits that the questions concerning CERD should
   have been raised between the Parties, referring specifically in this
   regard to the bilateral contacts between the Parties and certain rep-
   resentations made to the Security Council, even though nowhere in
   these has Georgia accused Russia of racial discrimination. Thus, in
   our opinion, the very substance of CERD was never debated between
   the Parties before the filing of a claim before the Court.” (Ibid.,
   p. 402, para. 12 ; emphasis added.)
Like the authors of that dissenting opinion, I myself find it “very sur-
sing that the Court has chosen to disregard this precondition to any


dicial action . . .” (I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 402, para. 13) in the present
dgment, just as it did when it considered the preliminary phase of the
 allo case, because I still consider it to be a fundamental condition upon
hich the Court should have ruled, even in the absence of an objection to
at effect, a preliminary objection or any other cumulative condition
quiring, for example, prior negotiation or arbitration.

 5. That said, in respect of the present Judgment on the merits, while I
 ted with the majority on the violations of Articles 9 and 13 of the Inter-
 tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 6 and 12 of
e African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, I still have reserva-
  ns about some of the reasoning, specifically that relating to the con-
 ct of the Congolese authorities, which amounts to little more than
ppositions and accusations that, in my view, were unnecessarily mali-
ous, being based on suspicion, or simply redundant. Furthermore, I
  s unable to subscribe to either the reasoning or the part of the opera-
 e clause which finds that the Congo violated the obligations incumbent
 on it under Article 36, paragraph 1 (b) of the Vienna Convention on
onsular Relations, while, in respect of the rejection of Guinea’s com-
aints concerning Mr. Diallo’s direct rights as associé, although I fully
bscribe to the Court’s conclusion, it is nevertheless my modest belief
at the reasoning behind that conclusion fails to take account of the
gument of principle as to why those complaints should be rejected.
 6. On the first point, I will confine myself to repeating that, just as the
 splaced reductionist reasoning which led the Court to consider it neces-
ry to imply (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic
  public of the Congo), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 601, para. 46) that the Congo acted out of
 liberate malice, cunning and calculated self-interest in issuing a notice
 refusal of entry [refoulement] rather than a notice of expulsion was, to my
 nd, gratuitous and unconvincing (ibid., opinion of Judge ad
 c Mampuya, p. 645), so too its reiteration in this Judgment pro-
 kes the same reaction on my part. The same is true of the assertion, which
 merely groundless speculation, that a link must have existed “between
r. Diallo’s expulsion and the fact that he had attempted to recover
bts . . . bringing cases for this purpose before the civil courts” (para-
aph 82 of the Judgment). While it is understandable that so serious a
arge might lie in the mouth of the Applicant, the World Court can-
 t endorse such a charge on the basis of an unfounded presumption.
 Furthermore, both of these very serious charges were unnecessary, as
 ither was required in order for the Court to reach its principal conclu-
  n on the lawfulness of the expulsion.
 7. Thus, having voted with the majority of the Court on certain vio-
 ions attributed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I also voted
  favour of point 7 of the Judgment’s operative clause relating to the
paration owing to Guinea by the Congo as a result of those violations.
owever, in my view, the Court could have usefully made it clear that the


 rely moral and non-material injury found to have been caused by the
 spondent’s purported violation of its obligation under Article 36,
 ragraph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations — a
olation which did not cause any material injury — calls only for
 eclaratory” or moral reparation. Fully in line with point 7 of the
 erative clause, which provides for reparation only in respect of the vio-
 ions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
e African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, such clarification
ould have served to demonstrate the Court’s confirmation of a matter
hich, following its established jurisprudence, has become a principle.
 us, as just one example of this, I cite the following passage from the
 rfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case — where it was in fact
e violation of a State’s sovereignty that was at issue — in which the
ourt unanimously finds that :
   “by reason of the acts of the British Navy in Albanian waters in the
   course of the Operation of November 12th and 13th, 1946, the United
   Kingdom violated the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of Alba-
   nia, and that this declaration by the Court constitutes in itself appro-
   priate satisfaction” (Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 36).
Doctrine fully supports this position, for example :
      “A purely moral injury may be redressed by purely moral ‘satis-
   faction’. The simplest form of satisfaction is a declaration by the
   court of the wrongfulness of a State’s conduct ; there is abundant
   jurisprudence in support of the proposition that, in the absence of
   material injury, a declaration by the court of the wrongful nature of
   conduct constituted sufficient reparation for the injury suffered
   (Corfu Channel, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 35).” (P. Reuter, Droit inter-
   national public, Paris, Presses universitaires de France, 1983, 6th ed.,
   p. 268.) [Translation by the Registry.]
 While J. Crawford observes that : “[o]ne of the most common modali-
 s of satisfaction provided in the case of moral or non-material injury to
e State is a declaration of the wrongfulness of the act by a competent
urt or tribunal”. (In his commentary on the International Law Com-
 ssion’s Article 37, paragraph 2, on State responsibility.)
 8. Moreover, in order to enhance the Respondent’s responsibility, the
ourt believed it indispensable to include an additional characteristic,
 d hence a condition further to those laid down in the ICCPR in order
r an expulsion to be lawful : Mr. Diallo’s expulsion was not only
nsidered unlawful, it was also “arbitrary”. In fact, Article 13 merely
pulates that the decision to expel be taken “in accordance with the law”
 d that the individual concerned be allowed to “submit the reasons
ainst his expulsion” to “the competent authority or a person or persons
pecially designated by the competent authority”. The same is true of
 ticle 12, paragraph 4, of the African Charter, which states that a
 n-national “legally admitted in a territory of a State party to the


esent Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a decision
ken in accordance with the law”. There is no mention anywhere of
rbitrary” expulsion, unless that “arbitrary” character derives from unlaw-
 ness or is implied by it. For it can only be one or the other. Either arbi-
 riness derives from unlawfulness, but manifestly this cannot be so, or
bitrariness is distinct from unlawfulness. In the latter case, in the first
ace this would impose an additional condition, not contemplated by Arti-
  13 of the Covenant. Indeed, the Court’s intent to impose this addi-
 nal, unwritten condition is clear when it states :
     “[f]irst, the applicable domestic law must itself be compatible with
   the other requirements of the Covenant and the African Charter ;
   second, an expulsion must not be arbitrary in nature . . .” (para-
   graph 65 of the Judgment ; emphasis added) ;
 when it observes that “the DRC has never been able to provide
ounds which might constitute a convincing basis for Mr. Diallo’s
pulsion”, or when it refers to “such an expulsion measure, one without
y defensible basis” (paragraph 82 of the Judgment). Secondly, this
ditional condition creates a need : a need to clarify and explain what
en, besides unlawfulness, arbitrariness would consist of.

9. There is no mention anywhere in the Judgment of any of these con-
rns, which to my mind, the Court, in introducing this further condition
 ating to arbitrariness, was not entitled to overlook. The Judgment
content to refer to the “considerable body of interpretative case law”
 the Human Rights Committee, which the Court describes as “quasi-
dicial” and to which it “believes that it should ascribe great weight”.
10. However, the two concepts are distinct and must be distinguished,
cause, while arbitrary can cover unlawful, the opposite is not true. If
  confine ourselves to the practice of that same Human Rights Com-
 ttee, as Sir N. Rodley states in his separate opinion :
      “‘Arbitrary’ in Article 9, paragraph 1, certainly covers unlawful-
   ness. It is evident from the very notion of arbitrariness and the pre-
   paratory work. But I fail to see how the opposite is also true. Nor is
   there anything in the preparatory work to justify it.” (C. v. Aus-
   tralia, 2002, Communication No. 900/1999.)

This may explain why an act, such as an arrest, which is perfectly legal,
n be arbitrary, and why every unlawful act is not necessarily arbitrary.
 is is how it is understood by the Human Rights Committee when it
 tes :
      “The drafting history of Article 9, paragraph 1, confirms that
   ‘arbitrariness’ is not to be equated with ‘against the law’, but must
   be interpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriate-
   ness, injustice and lack of predictability.” (See Communication
   No. 305/1988, Hugo van Alphen v. The Netherlands, views adopted


   on 23 July 1990, doc. CCPR/C/39/D/305/1988 of 15 August 1990,
   para. 5.8.)

11. Moreover, it should be noted that the “interpretative case law” of
e Human Rights Committee, to which this Judgment refers, relates
clusively to the interpretation of Article 9, paragraph 1, of the Cov-
ant, which makes a distinction between arbitrary arrest or detention (in
e second sentence) and the unlawful deprivation of liberty (third sen-
nce) :
     “1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No
   one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall
   be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance
   with such procedure as are established by law.”
Accordingly, it is only to arrests or detentions in the context of Arti-
   9, paragraph 1, of the Covenant that such “arbitrariness” refers. In
pport of this assertion, I cite, in particular, the following “case law” of
e Committee : Teófila Casafranca de Gómez v. Peru, 2003, Communi-
tion No. 981/2001 ; A. v. Australia, Communication No. 560/1993,
 ws adopted on 3 April 1997 ; Hugo van Alphen v. The Netherlands,
 ws adopted on 23 July 1990, doc. CCPR/C/39/D/305/1988 of 15 August
90 ; Womah Mukong v. Cameroon, views adopted on 21 July 1994,
 c. CCPR/C/51/D/458/1991 ; C. v. Australia, Communication No. 900/
99 ; Baban et al. v. Australia, Communication No. 1014/2001 ; Bakhti-
ri et al. v. Australia, Communication No. 1069/2002 ; Rafael Marques
 Morais v. Angola, 2005, Communication No. 1128/2002.
12. If, therefore, the drafters of the Covenant had wanted to lay down
  additional condition, while already using this concept of “arbitrary”
 Article 9 in respect of arrest and detention, they would have done so
  stating, in Article 13, that an expulsion has to be both in accordance
th the law and not arbitrary. Besides the fact that such a characteristic
  its nature and content — would need to be established, the unden-
ble truth is that, even then, Article 13 of the Covenant, whose alleged
olation is addressed in this Judgment, is not aimed at the arbitrariness of
 expulsion (a concept, moreover, not readily envisageable). Accordingly,
e silence of the Covenant and the African Charter in that respect should
  considered neither an omission which the Court should seek to make
 od, nor an error which it should try to correct, because the African
 arter, which postdates the Covenant by 15 years, could have incorpo-
 ed that notion of “arbitrary” had its sponsors so desired. The drafters of
e Covenant and, in turn, those of the Charter were guided by common
nse, which does not readily permit the contemplation of a condition such
 this, which would deem arbitrary a decision of so discretionary a nature
  the part of the State as whether or not to allow, under its law, the pres-
ce of foreigners on its territory.
13. As relevant jurisprudence on the subject of expulsion, in support


  the further condition that an expulsion should “not be arbitrary in
 ture”, paragraph 68 of the Judgment cites Article 1 of Protocol No. 7
  the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
  ndamental Freedoms, entitled “Procedural safeguards relating to
pulsion of aliens”. Cited without examples of specific decisions in
hich it has been interpreted in the same way as by the Court in the
esent case, this provision stipulates the following :
     “1. An alien lawfully resident in the territory of a State shall not
   be expelled therefrom except in pursuance of a decision reached in
   accordance with law and shall be allowed :
   (a) to submit reasons against his expulsion,
   (b) to have his case reviewed, and
   (c) to be represented for these purposes before the competent
       authority or a person or persons designated by that authority.”
 In this provision, we indeed not only find the same substance as in
 ticle 13 of the ICCPR, but also the same question of its interpretation,
thout, however, anything to corroborate the fact that the European
ourt has interpreted it in the same way as this Judgment.
 On the other hand, should we also wish to “make the case for the
fence”, we could find support in paragraph 2 of the same Article, which
ovides : “An alien may be expelled before the exercise of his rights under
 ragraph 1 (a), (b) and (c) of this Article, when such expulsion is neces-
ry in the interests of public order or is grounded on reasons of
 tional security.” The use here of a positive formulation (“An alien may
  expelled before the exercise of his rights under . . .” and not “cannot be
pelled before the exercise of his rights under . . . unless . . .”) shows that
 ritorial authorities are recognized to enjoy a certain latitude in the case,
ecifically, of a prerogative of a discretionary nature, which cannot be
 plicitly restricted, even by a suggestion that it is “arbitrary”.
 Finally, although there are no provisions anywhere for “material safe-
 ards”, the title of this same Article 1 of the European Protocol, “Pro-
dural safeguards relating to expulsion of aliens”, makes it clear that
en the European Convention did not intend for an expulsion measure
  be subject to material, substantive conditions, thus also letting it be
 derstood that the content of the only condition approximating to a
bstantive one, “in the interests of [the] public . . . [and for] reasons of
 tional security”, is defined at the discretion of the State authority.
  erefore, I do not believe it justified to treat, as the Court does (para-
aph 72 of the Judgment), the requirement to provide reasons for the
cision to expel laid down by Article 15 of the 1983 Legislative Order as
strictly substantive condition, when only the territorial State is in a
 sition to say what is and what is not “necessary in the interests of pub-
   order” or required for its “national security”. This argument,
pounded at length by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Counter-
emorial, paras. 1.27-1.28), was not considered by the Court.


 I will now turn to the source of my disagreement with the majority of
 e Court.

                          MY DISAGREEMENT
 The Alleged Violation of the Obligation under Article 36. para-
 aph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations :

            Content and Sense of the Obligation to Inform
 14. Article 36, paragraph 1 (b), provides :
     “[I]f he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State
   shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if,
   within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or
   committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any
   other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post
   by the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall be for-
   warded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities
   shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under
   this subparagraph.”

 The Congo is criticized in particular for failing to inform directly and
  ithout delay” the individual concerned, Mr. Diallo, of his right to
quest, through the Guinean Embassy in Kinshasa, the intervention of
 e Guinean authorities. In the Judgment, the allegation is presented, and
 e relevant provision interpreted, in a way which, in my view, fails to
ke account of all the pertinent elements as laid down by the Conven-
