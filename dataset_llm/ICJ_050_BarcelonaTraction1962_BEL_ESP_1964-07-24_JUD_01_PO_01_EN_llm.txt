Whilst the text of Article 37 of the Court’s Statute is quite different
to that of Article 36 (5), which was the subject of examination in
Israel v. Bulgaria, and its terms are, in my view, so clear as to admit
of no doubt as to their meaning, it is difficult to discern any decisive
distinction in principle between Article 36 (5) and Article 37 in relation
to the cardinal questions raised by the second Preliminary Objection.

For my part, for reasons which appear in the Joint Dissenting Opinion
in Israel v. Bulgaria, to which I continue to adhere, I would, apart
from other considerations. referred to in the Court’s Judgment, be
compelled to reject this Preliminary Objection.
