4. The counter-claim is dealt with in paragraphs 101 to 124 of the
Judgment. Subject to the following observations, which relate in particu-
lar to paragraph 123, I have no difficulty in subscribing to the Court’s
findings and to point 2 of the operative paragraph. I do, however, regret
the excessively narrow limits within which the Court confined the grounds
for its decision. As it explains in paragraph 120 of the Judgment, the
Court sets out “in chronological order” Iran’s alleged attacks and, in
relation to each of them, confines itself to examining whether the vessel
mentioned in the counter-claim was engaged in commerce or navigation
between the territories of the two High Contracting Parties (para. 120 of
the Judgment). The overall conclusion, as set out in paragraph 121, is
negative: “none of the vessels described by the United States as being
damaged by Iran’s alleged attacks was engaged in commerce or naviga-

» »

tion ‘between the territories of the two High Contracting Parties’ ”.

5. Two further grounds, either of which would have sufficed for the
counter-claim to be dismissed, were omitted by the Court.

The first concerns the attributability of the acts alleged against Iran.
That the events in question occurred was not in doubt, but it still
remained to be shown that they were attributable to an agency of the
Respondent to the counter-claim. Not only did Iran consistently dispute
that its responsibility had been established for any of the incidents set out
in the American claim, but the Court itself was not convinced by the
arguments presented by the American Government on this point (see in
particular paras. 58-59 and 71-72 of the Judgment). However, the argu-
ments relied on by the Court to dismiss the grounds of justification or
defence put forward by the Respondent to the original action are not re-
addressed when the counter-claim is considered.

6. During the war between Iran and Iraq, what became known as the
“Tanker War” consisted in the use of force against ships, mainly oil


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 365

tankers, flying the flag of States other than the two belligerents. For the
latter, the export of petroleum products, their principal economic resource,
was indispensable to the pursuit of the war, which required substantial
financial resources. This was particularly so for Iran, which, unlike Iraq,
was receiving no outside aid. Another difference between the two States
concerned the means used to transport the oil abroad: whilst a part at
. least of the Iraqi oil was exported overland, the entirety of the Iranian
oil had to be shipped by sea through the Persian Gulf.

The Tanker War has been analysed in two studies, which largely con-
cur on the facts, one by an Egyptian researcher, Ms Nadia El-Sayed El-
Shazly', the other by an American professor, George K. Walker”.
During the initial years of the war between Iran and Iraq (1981-1984),

opment and International Law (1988), p. 381. F. L. Wiswall, “Neutrality, the Rights of
Shipping and the Use of Force in the Persian Gulf”, 31 Virginia Journal of International
Law (1991), p. 620, is alone in proposing a figure of 536 attacks.


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 366

“Owners of ageing tanker fleets, registered with poorly regulated
countries, motivated them to send their old tankers to the Gulf.
They were mostly flying flags of convenience, manned by cheap and
poorly trained crews, and had structural defects.” (P. 44.)

These two statements are mutually corroborative and explain why,
during the Tanker War, the United States assumed the duty of protecting
freedom of navigation in general, including that of vessels not flying its
own flag. Thus it is no surprise to find on the successive lists produced by
the United States in this case two Panamanian vessels (Texaco Carib-
bean, Grand Wisdom), five Liberian vessels ( Lucy, Diane, Stena Explorer,
Stena Concordia, Sungari), and a Bahamian vessel (Esso Freeport).
Apart from the two Kuwaiti tankers flying an American flag of conven-
ience, to which I shall return, only the Esso Demetia bore the flag of
a State (the United Kingdom) not belonging to the category of States
notorious for the ease with which they register ships not having any
real link with them and for the laxity of the control exercised by them
over such vessels.

7. The most serious incident in the Tanker War, that which resulted in
the greatest number of victims (36 killed and 21 seriously injured), was
the destruction of the American warship USS Stark by two Iraqi Exocet
missiles on 17 May 1987. The Iraqi Government expressed its regrets to
the United States Government and in 1989 paid it compensation (Walker,
p. 60; El-Shazly, pp. 282-292). Ironically, after this attack (whose only
purpose may well have been to make it appear attributable to Iran and to
provoke the internationalization of the war), the position of the United
States continued to be favourable to Iraq. It was at the end of that same
month (29 May) that Assistant Secretary of Defense, Richard Armitage,
stated: “We can’t stand to see Iraq defeated.”* Ms El-Shazly, who
cites this statement, adds: “Thus he sealed the death certificate of US
neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war, and this myth was officially laid to
rest.” (P. 291.)


“in the circumstances of this case, a generic claim of breach of
Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty cannot be made out
independently of the specific incidents whereby, it is alleged, the
actions of Iran made the Persian Gulf unsafe for commerce and
navigation, and specifically for commerce and navigation between
the territories of the parties”.

In the second sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 123,
and in paragraph 124, the Judgment finds that for this reason it must dis-
miss the United States claim.

10. Another justification offered by the United States consists in an
attempt to identify an “American interest” in making good flag States’
failure to act. It is sufficient to point out, without addressing in detail the
arguments made in this regard, that they run directly counter to the very
firm position which the Court took more than 30 years ago in the Bar-
celona Traction case and has never repudiated, i.e., that by forming a
company under the laws of a particular State (or, as in the present case,
by registering a ship in a particular country), the shareholders in the com-
pany (or the shipowners) had sought certain advantages for which there
was a countervailing consideration, i.e., that that State alone was per-

Poulsen and Diva Navigation Corp., ECR, p. I-6019, cited by Rosalyn Higgins, “The ICT,
the ECJ and the Integrity of International Law”, 52 International and Comparative Law
Quarterly (2003), pp. 6-7. Paragraph 13 of that judgment recalls that: “under interna-
tional law a vessel in principle has only one nationality, that of the State in which it is
registered”. The judgment goes on to hold that, for purposes of an EEC Regulation,
a vessel cannot be treated as a vessel of a Member State “on the ground that it has a
genuine link with that Member State” (para. 16).


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 370

mitted to grant its diplomatic protection to the company (or to rely on
a bilateral treaty in its favour). One of the reasons given by the Court for
not “adopt[ing] . . . the theory of diplomatic protection of shareholders as
such”, that it would open “the door to competing diplomatic claims” and
“could create an atmosphere of confusion and insecurity in international
and economic relations” (case concerning Barcelona Traction, Light and
Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970,
p. 49, para. 96), applies just as strongly to the right of protection of ships,
which could potentially be exercised concurrently by the flag State, the
national State of the individual or undertaking holding a majority of the
ownership interests in the undertaking owning the vessel, by the State of
the cargo owner, etc. In respect of the counter-claim brought by the
United States, the principle deriving from the Judgment in the Barcelona
Traction case is of particularly compelling force because the freedom of
navigation protected by Article X, paragraph 1, of the 1955 Treaty is not
freedom of navigation in general, on all seas throughout the world and in
favour of all vessels whatever their flag, but freedom of navigation of
“[v]essels under the flag of either High Contracting Party” exercising that
freedom “[bJetween the territories of two High Contracting Parties”. If
both of these conditions are not satisfied and one of them remains unmet,
the claim does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court as defined in
Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the Treaty. In respect of vessels not meeting
the conditions laid down in Article X, paragraph 1, the Court lacks juris-
diction to decide whether the damage they suffered is imputable to Iran.

Three of the vessels referred to in the above-mentioned list merit
special attention. The Samuel B. Roberts is excluded as a warship
(see paragraph 9 above).

Equally, the reflagging of the two Kuwaiti tankers does not bring
the alleged damage within the scope of Article X, paragraph 1. Such
reflagging, carried out during the war between Iran and Iraq in order to
place under the aegis of the United States vessels having the nationality
of a State which supported Iraq in its war effort against Iran, cannot be
relied upon against Iran. It should be noted that by 1989 the Kuwaiti
ships which had temporarily adopted the United States flag had already
recovered their original registration (“deflagging”)'°. Moreover, since
this change occurred before the date on which the counter-claim was sub-
mitted, that claim fails to satisfy the rule requiring continuity of the
bond of nationality. Further, the terms under which these two vessels

Action: US Naval Deployment, ‘Non-Belligerency’ and ‘Defensive Reprisals’ in the Final
Year of the Iran-Iraq War”, 25 Ocean Development and International Law (1994), p. 40.


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 371

were reflagged with a United States flag of convenience prevent the
counter-claim from satisfying another condition laid down by Article X,
paragraph 1, i.e., it cannot claim the benefit of freedom of commerce
and navigation “[bletween the territories of the two High Contracting
Parties”, because under the United States own domestic law, vessels
having thus obtained United States registration are not granted access
to United States ports.

11. Several passages in the Judgment refer to the “context of the gen-
eral events that took place in the Persian Gulf between 1980 and 1988, in
particular the armed conflict that opposed Iran and Iraq” (para. 23 of the
Judgment). It is only in veiled terms that in the following sentence the
Court implies that Iraq was the aggressor State. The truth of this is gen-
erally accepted today, and I feel it would be not unhelpful to indicate
what the attitude of third States was, and in particular the United States,
in the course of the conflict.

At the start of the war, the United States and the other western Powers
adopted a wait-and-see attitude marked by a certain cynicism: after the
fall of the régime of the Shah of Iran, the alliance with whom had been
one of the key elements in America’s Middle East policy, there was a
vacuum in the region. At the start of the war, neither the United States
nor the other western Powers wished to see a total victory by either of the
two belligerents. They were waiting — and hoping — to see the two
adversaries exhaust themselves without either being able to achieve
hegemony in the region. The fact that neither of the two belligerents was
named as aggressor by the Security Council enabled the other States to
sell them arms, whereas it would have been unlawful to provide military
aid to a State defined as the aggressor. The relations between the United
States and Iran had just gone thorough a particularly severe crisis fol-
lowing the hostage-taking at the United States embassy in Tehran, and
the Court had condemned Iran for this!!. For their part, the Arab States
of the Gulf had no particular sympathy for the anti-monarchist views of
the Islamic Republic of Iran. All of these circumstances encouraged Iraq
to attack Iran.

After Iraq’s initial successes, which enabled it to occupy part of Iranian
territory, Iran succeeded in reversing the position, and it was then that
the United States began its about-turn. Compliance with the obligations
of neutrality was not incompatible with American interests in the Middle
East as long as an Iranian victory appeared out of reach. By contrast, as
soon as Iraq’s chances appeared to be fading, it became necessary to
restore the balance between the opposing forces. It was also from then on
that American aid to the Iraqi war effort increased substantially, a
phenomenon hardly compatible with the maintenance of strict neutrality

Iran), Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 3.


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 372

in relation to the two belligerents: the launching of “Operation Staunch”,
a campaign seeking to dissuade the western allies from selling arms to
Iran (El-Shazly, p. 215); the transmission to Iraq of satellite intelligence
(El-Shazly, p. 323); authorization for the sale of 60 helicopters “for agri-
cultural purposes”, and a loan of $460 million for the purchase of rice
(Walker, p. 47). In addition, there was significant diplomatic support: in
1982, Iraq was removed from the list of countries supporting interna-
tional terrorism and in November 1984 diplomatic relations were resumed
(Walker, pp. 48, 55). Ms El-Shazly summarizes American policy during
the war between Iran and Iraq in the following terms:

“Washington conducted a realpolitik strategy. It repeatedly pro-
claimed its neutrality, stated its interests and clear objectives in the
Gulf, hand in hand with a concealed agenda, the blueprint of which
combined the leaning toward Iraq with the yet undisclosed licensing
of arms sales.” (P. 207.)

While Iran may have failed to establish decisively the relationship
between the American attack on Sassan and Sirri and Iraq’s reconquest
of the al-Faw area close to Basra, the coincidence of the two events is
disturbing to say the least. The operation termed “Praying Mantis”
resulted in the destruction of the two platforms and of two Iranian
frigates and was considered by Professor Walker as “[t]he largest com-
bined air and surface engagement in war at sea for the US Navy since
World War II” (p. 69).

While it is admittedly not for the Court to rule on the support given to
the Iraqi war effort by Saudi Arabia or by Kuwait, who are absent from
the present proceedings, yet the case of Kuwait deserves special mention
because of the aid provided by the United States to that State, in par-
ticular by authorizing the American reflagging of 11 Kuwaiti tankers. On
this point, I cannot do better than quote a distinguished American inter-
national lawyer, Professor Louis Henkin:

“In the Gulf, some spokesman said recently, the United States
remain formally neutral. But even if the concept of neutrality can
apply in some cases, can the United States be neutral here? No one
would accuse us of being a friend of Iran, but there is a strong case
that Iraq is probably the aggressor. No one has mentioned that for
some years now. It is true that the Security Council refrained from
so holding, in part because the United States would not permit it, or
because the Russians would not permit it. That raises some ques-
tions, but that doesn’t change the law; in the absence of a Security
Council determination that one party was the aggressor, do the laws
of the Charter not apply? In the absence of such a finding by the


OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 373

Security Council, are States free to be neutral even if it is clear that
one side launched the war in violation of the Charter? Is Kuwait
neutral, or is it, as the first speaker suggested, perhaps a co-belliger-
ent? Is the United States supporting Kuwait, and, if so, are we also
co-belligerents? If so, we may not be only supporting the aggressor
but if the old laws of war apply — we may also be violating the law
of war.

I suggest we may not only have slipped into the war but, from the
international lawyer’s point of view, we seem to have slipped into a
particular position of international law without much thought about
it and without any thought to the long-term consequences. In fact,
we seem to be taking seriously the outdated law of war, but not the
contemporary law against war. In the process we may have eroded
both. At least it cannot be said that the law on neutrality and
belligerency is what it was before 1945.” 12

12. On 9 December 1991 the supplementary report of the United
Nations Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council
resolution 598 (1987) (doc. S/23273) expressed in unequivocal terms the
view that Iraq was responsible:

“6. The Iraqi reply to my letter of 14 August 1991 is not a substan-
tial one; therefore I am bound to rely on explanations given by Iraq
earlier. That these explanations do not appear sufficient or accept-
able to the international community is a fact. Accordingly, the out-
standing event under the violations referred to in paragraph 5 above
is the attack of 22 September 1980 against Iran, which cannot be jus-
tified under the Charter of the United Nations, any recognized rules
and principles of international law or any principles of international
morality and entails the responsibility for the conflict.

7. Even if before the outbreak of the conflict there had been some
encroachment by Iran on Iraqi territory, such encroachment did not
justify Iraq’s aggression against Iran — which was followed by
Iraq’s continuous occupation of Iranian territory during the conflict
— in violation of the prohibition of the use of force, which is
regarded as one of the rules of jus cogens.”

OIL PLATFORMS (SEP. OP. RIGAUX) 374

The supplementary report confines itself to responsibility for land
operations; it contains no observation regarding the war at sea, and in
particular the Tanker War.

13. Thus there were two grounds for dismissal of the counter-claim
that were not invoked by the Court. The first is that the claim was not
justified in terms of fact (paras. 5-7 above), the second being that it did
not satisfy the nationality requirement in respect of the vessels attacked
during the war between Iran and Iraq. Yet either of these two grounds
should logically have taken precedence over the sole ground relied on in
the Judgment, namely that none of the vessels “was engaged in commerce
or navigation ‘between the territories of the two High Contracting
Parties’ (para. 121 of the Judgment).

The choice of this ground alone is doubtless explicable by the Court’s
desire to establish an artificial parallel between the two claims, both being
rejected for the same reason.

III. OBSERVATIONS ON THE REASONING UNDERLYING DISMISSAL
OF THE ORIGINAL CLAIM

(a) The Distinction Drawn between the Defence Based on Article XX,
Paragraph 1 (d), of the 1955 Treaty and That Based on the Right of
Self-defence

14. In paragraph 78 of the Judgment the Court finds that the actions
carried out by United States forces against Iranian oil installations can-
not be justified either under Article XX, paragraph 1 (d), of the 1955
Treaty or as acts of self-defence. This is a situation analogous to that in
criminal law where one and the same act is covered by two offences, and
thus falls to be assessed by reference to the terms of each of those
offences.

Paragraph 41 of the Judgment fails to do proper justice to this dual
characterization. Thus in that paragraph the Court interprets subpara-
graph (d) in light of general international law without first addressing
the issue of the High Contracting Parties’ intention. And yet this is a pro-
vision which occurs in a number of treaties of friendship similar to that
signed in 1955 by Iran with the United States and also in Article XXI of
the GATT, and on which there exists a substantial body of comment in
the literature.

Paragraph 1 (d) reads as follows:
