The dispute upon which the Court is called on to adjudicate has
been clearly defined by the Parties in their Pleadings and oral
arguments. The Court has before it a concrete case: did the Swedish
authorities, by applying the measure of protective upbringing
(skyddsuppfostran) to the Dutch infant, Marie Elisabeth Boll, fail
to respect obligations resulting from the 1902 Convention on the
guardianship of infants? The task of the Court is thus limited. It
is not concerned with the correctness of the application of the
Swedish Law of June 6th, 1924, on the protection of children and
young persons, nor has it to pass upon the proper appreciation of
the grounds on which the challenged decisions are based, or on the
circumstances to which those grounds are related. These questions
are not within the terms of the present dispute and would raise
points which are outside the proceedings.


The Government of the Netherlands submits that these decisions
are not in conformity with the provisions of the 1902 Convention.
The institution of protective upbringing in the case of Marie
Elisabeth Boll prevents the infant from being handed over to the
guardian for the exercise of her functions. The 1902 Convention
provides that the guardianship of an infant shall be governed by
his national law, and the Government of the Netherlands draws the
conclusion that the Swedish authorities could take no measure once
the national authorities had taken decisions organizing guardianship
of the infant. The limitation on the principle of the national law
contained in Article 7 of the Convention, according to the Govern-
ment of the Netherlands, is not applicable to the present case
because Swedish protective upbringing is not a measure permitted
by that Article and because the condition of urgency required by
that provision has not been satisfied.

The Government of Sweden does not dispute the fact that pro-
tective upbringing temporarily impedes the exercise of custody to
which the guardian is entitled by virtue of guardianship under
Dutch law; this fact, however, does not constitute a breach of the
1902 Convention or a failure by Sweden to fulfil her obligations
thereunder. In support of its contentions the Government of Sweden
relies upon the following grounds:

(1) The right to custody, at the time when the infant was placed
under the regime of°protective upbringing, belonged to her father,
and it was in his case an attribute of the puissance paternelle, which
is not governed by the 1902 Convention on guardianship. In the
circumstances in which guardianship and the right to custody were
conferred on Mme Postema, the 1902 Convention is equally inappli-
cable to that right which was merely the continuation of the father’s
right to custody.

(2) The Swedish Law for the protection of children of June 6th,
1924, applies to every infant residing in Sweden, and the jurisdic-
tion which that Law confers upon the Swedish authorities remains
outside the Convention, which governs only conflicts of law and of
jurisdiction in respect of the guardianship of infants and which does
not extend to the settlement of other conflicts of law. The Law for
the protection of children being a law within the category of ordre
public, the protective upbringing decreed by the Swedish authorities
does not constitute a breach of the 1902 Convention, the Conven-



tion being incapable of affecting the right of the contracting States
to make the powers of a foreign guardian, as indeed foreign parents,
subject to the restrictions required by ordre public.

With reference to the first ground relied upon by the Swedish
Government, the Court observes that in the written and oral pro-
ceedings a distinction appears to have been made between the
period during which Johannes Boll was invested with the guardian-
ship of his daughter under Dutch law, the law applicable in accord-
ance with Article 1 of the 1902 Convention, and the period after he
had been released from guardianship when the latter was entrust-
ed to Mme Postema. That may lead to a distinction being drawn
between the original institution of the regime of protective up-
bringing in respect of the infant and her. maintenance under this
regime in face of the guardianship conferred upon Mme Postema.
The Court does not consider that it need be concerned with this
distinction. The grounds for its decision are applicable to the
whole of the dispute.

The Court has before it a measure taken in pursuance of the
Swedish Law of June 6th, 1924, on the protection of children and
young persons. It has tc consider this measure in the light of what
it was the intention of the Swedish Law to establish, to compare it
with the guardianship governed by the 1902 Convention and to
determine whether the application and the maintenance of the
measure in respect of an infant whose guardianship falls within
that Convention involve a breach of the Convention.

these decisions, i.e. according to the facts in the present case,
cannot be regarded as a rival guardianship to the guardianship
established in the Netherlands in accordance with the x902 Con-
vention.

The Swedish measure of protective upbringing, as instituted and
maintained in respect of Marie Elisabeth Boll, placed obstacles in
the way of the full exercise by the guardian of her right to custody.
Before the Supreme Administrative Court she relied, as has been
recalled, upon her intention to entrust the infant to a home of her
choice: that intention clearly corresponded to an exercise by the
guardian of her right to custody. The guardian was not, however,
asking that her intention should simply be acted upon; she relied
upon it as a reason for terminating the regime of protective up-
bringing. The Supreme Administrative Court, by its judgment of
February 21st, 1956, dismissed her claim. In dismissing it, the
Court limited itself no doubt to adjudicating upon the mainte-
nance of protective upbringing, but, at the same time, it placed an



obstacle in the way of the full exercise of the right to custody
belonging to the guardian. Does this constitute a failure to observe
the 1902 Convention, Article 6 of which provides that ‘the ad-
ministration of a guardianship extends to the person... of theinfant” ?

In order to answer this question, it is not necessary, as has
already been said, for the Court to ascertain the real or alleged
reasons which determined or influenced the decisions complained
of. It is called upon to pronounce only on the compatibility of the
measure with the obligations binding upon Sweden under the 1902
Convention. It has before it a measure instituted pursuant to a
Swedish law which impedes the exercise by the guardian of the
right to custody conferred upon her by Dutch law in accordance
with the 1902 Convention. Are the imposition and maintenance of
such a measure incompatible with the 1902 Convention?

The Court is not confronted by a situation in which it would
suffice for it to say that a national law cannot override the obliga-
tions assumed by treaty. It is asked to say whether the measure
taken and impugned is or is not compatible with the obligations
binding upon Sweden by virtue of the 1902 Convention. To do
that, it must determine what are the obligations imposed by that
Convention, how far they extend and, especially, it must deter-
mine whether, by stipulating that the guardianship of an infant is
governed by the national law of the infant, the 1902 Convention
intended to prohibit the application to a foreign infant of a law such
as the Swedish Law on the protection of children.

The 1902 Convention, as indicated by its preamble, was designed
to “lay down common provisions to govern the guardianship of
infants”. It provides for the application of the national law of the
infant for the institution and operation of guardianship by expressly
extending in Article 6 the administration of a guardianship to the
person and to all the property of the infant. It goes no farther
than that, and indeed it has been pointed out that it does not make
complete provision for guardianship, which should serve as a
warning against any construction which would extend it beyond
its true scope. In providing that guardianship and, in particular,
that the guardian’s right to custody should be governed by the
national law of the infant, the Convention was intended to deter-
mine what law should be applied to settle these points. It was
intended, in accordance with the general purpose of the Confer-
ences on Private International Law, that it should put an end tothe
divergences of view as to whether preference ought to be given in
this connection to the national law of the infant, to that of his
place of residence, etc., but it was not intended to lay down, in the
domain of guardianship, and particularly of the right to custody,
any immunity of an infant or of a guardian with respect to the
whole body of the local law. The local law with regard to guardian-
ship is in principle excluded, but not all the other provisions of the
local law.



There may be some points of contact between matters governed
by the national law of the infant which is applicable to guardian-
ship and matters falling within the ambit of the local law. It does
not follow that in such cases the national law of the infant must
always prevail over the application of the local law and that,
accordingly, the exercise of the powers of a guardian is always
beyond the reach of local laws dealing with subjects other than the
assignment of guardianship and the determination of the powers
and duties of a guardian. If, for instance, for the purposes of the
administration of guardianship in respect of the person or the
property of an infant, a guardian finds it necessary to travel to
some foreign country, he will, so far as his journey is concerned, be
subject to the laws relating to the entry and residence of foreigners.
This is something outside the scope of guardianship as regulated
by the 1902 Convention.

If, in a country in which a foreign infant, to whom the 1902
Convention applies, is living, laws relating to compulsory education
and the sanitary supervision of children, professional training or
the participation of young people in certain work, are applicable
to foreigners, in circumstances assumed to be in conformity with
the requirements of international law and of treaties governing
these matters, a guardian’s right to custody under the national
law of the infant cannot override the application of such laws to a
foreign infant. In adopting the national law of the infant as the
proper law to govern guardianship, including the guardian’s right
to custody, the 1902 Convention was not intended to decide upon
anything other than guardianship, the true purpose of which is to
make provision for the protection of the infant; it was not intended
to regulate or to restrict the scope of laws designed to meet pre-
occupations of a general character.

The same must be true of the Swedish Law on the protection of
children and young persons. Considered in its application to children
of Swedish nationality, the Law is not a law on guardianship, it
does not relate to the legal institution of guardianship. It is appli-
cable whether the infant be within the puissance paternelle of the
parents or under guardianship. Protective upbringing which con-
stitutes an application of the Law is superimposed, when that is
necessary, on either, without bringing either to an end but para-
lyzing their effects to the extent that they are in conflict with the
requirements of protective upbringing.

Is the 1902 Convention to be construed as meaning—tacitly,
for the reason that it provides that the guardianship of an infant
shall be governed by his national law—that it was intended to
prohibit the application of any legislative enactment on a different
subject-matter the indirect effect of which would be to restrict,
though not to abolish, the guardian's right to custody? So to
interpret the Convention would be to go beyond its purpose. That
purpose was to put an end, in questions of guardianship, to diffi-

=



culties arising from the conflict of laws. That was its only purpose.
It was sought to achieve it by laying down to this end common
rules which the contracting States must respect. To understand
the Convention as limiting the right of contracting States to apply
laws on a different topic would be to go beyond that purpose.

The 1902 Convention determines the domain of application of
the laws of each contracting State in the matter of guardianship.
It does this by requiring each contracting State to apply the
national law of the infant. If the 1902 Convention had intended to
‘regulate the domain of application of laws such as the Swedish Law
on the protection of children and young persons, it would follow
that that Law should be applied to Swedish infants in a foreign
country. But no one has sought to attribute such an extraterri-
torial effect to that Law. The 1902 Convention is therefore not
concerned with the determination of the domain of application of
such a law.

A comparison between the purpose of the 1902 Convention and
that of the Swedish Law on the protection of children shows that
the purpose of the latter places it outside the field of application of
the Convention.

The 1902 Convention did not seek to define what it meant by
guardianship, but there is no doubt that the legal systems, as
between which it sought to establish some harmony by prescribing
what was the proper law to govern that situation, understood and
understand by guardianship an institution the object of which is
the protection of the infant: the protection and guidance of his
person, the safeguarding of his pecuniary interests and the fulfilling
of the functions rendered necessary by his legal incapacity. Guard-
ianship and protective upbringing have certain common purposes.
The special feature of the regime of protective upbringing is that
it is put into operation only in respect of children who, for reasons
inherent in them or for causes external to them, are in an abnormal
situation—a situation which, if allowed to continue, might give
rise to danger going beyond the person of the child. Protective up-
bringing contributes to the protection of the child, but at the same
time, and above all, it is designed to protect society against dangers
resulting from improper upbringing, inadequate hygiene, or moral
corruption of young people. The 1902 Convention recognizes the
fact that guardianship, in order to achieve its aim of individual pro-
tection, needs to be governed by the national law of the infant;
to achieve the aim of the social guarantee which it is the purpose of
the Swedish Law on the protection of children and young persons
to provide, it is necessary that it should apply to all young people
living in Sweden.

Protective upbringing is not, as is guardianship, applied for a
pre-ordained period during which it is maintained. The public
service of the protection of children is much more flexible, just
because the measures taken depend upon the circumstances, and



can be modified in accordance with alterations in those circum-
stances. Its functions correspond to preoccupations of a moral and
social order. The Swedish Law being designed to provide a social
guarantee, it was presented, on behalf of the Government of
Sweden, as a law of ordre public which, as such, is binding upon all
those upon Swedish territory. The consequences to be drawn from
such a characterization were argued at length before the Court. It
was contended that a proper interpretation of the 1902 Convention
must lead to recognition that this Convention, bringing about the
unification as between the contracting States of certain rules for
the settlement of conflicts of law, must be understood as containing
an implied reservation authorizing, on the ground of ordre public,
the overruling of the application of the foreign law recognized as
normally the proper law to govern the legal relationship in question.
It has been argued that such an exception is recognized in the
systems of private international law of those countries which
joined in the partial codification of this branch of the law. The
Court does not consider it necessary to pronounce upon this con-
tention. It seeks to ascertain in a more direct manner whether,
having regard to its purpose, the 1902 Convention lays down any
rules which the Swedish authorities have disregarded.

The 1902 Convention had to meet a problem of the conflict of
private law rules. It presupposes the hesitation which was felt
in the choice of the law applicable to a given legal relationship:
the national law of an individual, the law of his place of residence,
the lex fori, etc. It gave the preference to the national law of the
infant and thereby prescribed to the courts of each contracting
State that they should apply a foreign law when the infant in-
volved was a foreigner. It is perfectly conceivable that the courts
of a State should in certain cases apply a foreign law.

Very different is the sense of the question if it be asked what
is the domain of the applicability of the Swedish Law or of the
Dutch law on the protection of children. The measures provided for
or prescribed by Swedish law are applied, at least in the first stage
as was done in the present case, by an administrative organ. Such
an organ can act only in accordance with its own law: it is incon-
ceivable that the Swedish Child Welfare Board should apply
Dutch law to a Dutch infant living in Sweden and equally incon-
ceivable that the competent Dutch organ should apply Dutch law

It thus seems to the Court that, in spite of their points of contact
and in spite, indeed, of the encroachments revealed in practice, the
1902 Convention on the guardianship of infants does not include
within its scope the matter of the protection of children and of
young persons as understood by the Swedish Law of June 6th, 1924.
The 1902 Convention cannot therefore have given rise to obliga-
tions binding upon the signatory States in a field outside the matter
with which it was concerned, and accordingly the Court does not
in the present case find any failure to observe that Convention on
the part of Sweden.

This finding makes it unnecessary to examine a further sub-
mission put forward by the Government of the Netherlands after

Judge KojeEvNIKOV states that he is unable to concur either
in the reasoning or in the operative clause of the Judgment
because, in his opinion, on the basis of the principle pacta sunt
servanda, having regard to the fact that the rights and obliga-
tions of the Parties under the 1902 Convention governing the
guardianship of infants are abundantly clear, having regard to
the character of the case and the available facts, as well as the
legitimate interests of the infant concerned—who is of Dutch
nationality—the Court ought to have held that the measures taken
by the Swedish administrative authorities in respect of the said
infant, which impede the exercise of the right of guardianship
based on the treaty, are not in conformity with the obligations
binding upon Sweden vis-à-vis the Netherlands by virtue of the
aforementioned 1902 Convention, in particular Articles I and 6
of the Convention.

Judge SpiropoULOS states that, although he shares the opinion
of the Court that Sweden cannot be held to have failed to respect
‘her obligations under the 1goz Covention in this case, he considers
that the rejection of the claim of the Government of the Nether-
lands ought rather to be based upon the character of ordre public



of the Swedish Law on the protection of children and young persons.
