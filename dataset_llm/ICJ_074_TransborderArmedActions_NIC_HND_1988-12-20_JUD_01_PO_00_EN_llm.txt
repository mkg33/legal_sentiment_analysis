11. By a letter of 12 April 1988, the Agent of Honduras requested that oral
proceedings on the questions of jurisdiction and admissibility should be held
between 23 May and 10 June 1988. Following a meeting between the President
of the Court and the Agents of the Parties on 20 April 1988, at which the Agent
of Nicaragua indicated that his Government had no objection to the dates
suggested by Honduras, the President decided that the oral proceedings should
begin on 6 June 1988.

12. At public hearings held between 6 and 15 June 1988, the Court heard oral
arguments addressed to it by the following :

For Honduras: H.E. Mr. Mario Carias,
H.E. Mr. J. R. Hernandez Alcerro,
Professor D. W. Bowett,
Professor P.-M. Dupuy.

For Nicaragua:  H.E. Mr. Carlos Argiiello Gomez,
Professor Abram Chayes,
Professor À. Pellet,
Professor I. Brownlie.

In the course of the hearings, questions were put to both Parties by Members of
the Court. Replies were given to some extent orally during the hearings; addi-


ARMED ACTIONS (JUDGMENT) 73

tional replies in writing were filed in the Registry within a time-limit fixed under
Article 72 of the Rules of Court. Honduras availed itself of the opportunity
afforded by that Article to submit to the Court comments on the written replies
of Nicaragua.

13. In the course of the written proceedings, the following submissions were
presented by the Parties:

On behalf of the Republic of Honduras,
in the Memorial:

“In view of the facts and arguments set forth in the preceding parts of

1. It is a politically-inspired, artificial request which the Court should
not entertain consistently with its judicial character.

2. The Application is vague and the allegations contained in it are not
properly particularized, so that the Court cannot entertain the Application
without substantial prejudice to Honduras.

3. Nicaragua has failed to show that, in the opinion of the Parties, the
dispute cannot be settled by direct negotiations, and thus Nicaragua fails
to satisfy an essential precondition to the use of the procedures established
by the Pact of Bogota, which include reference of disputes to the Interna-
tional Court of Justice.

4. Having accepted the Contadora process as a ‘special procedure’
within the meaning of Article II of the Pact of Bogota, Nicaragua is pre-
cluded both by Article IV of the Pact and by elementary considerations of
good faith from commencing any other procedure for pacific settlement
until such time as the Contadora process has been concluded; and that
time has not arrived.

As to Jurisdiction:

The Court is not competent to entertain the Application of Nicaragua
because:

1. The dispute as alleged by Nicaragua is excluded from the jurisdiction
of the Court by the terms of the Honduran declaration of 22 May 1986, and
such declaration applies whether the jurisdiction is alleged to exist on the
basis of Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogota or Article 36, paragraph 2, of
the Statute of the Court.

2. Alternatively, Article XXXI cannot be invoked as a basis of jurisdic-
tion independently of Article XXXII, and the latter Article precludes any
unilateral application to the Court except where:

(a) conciliation procedures have been undergone without a solution, and

(b) the parties have not agreed on an arbitral procedure.
Neither condition is satisfied in the present case.

ARMED ACTIONS (JUDGMENT) 74

3. Jurisdiction cannot be based on Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Stat-
ute of the Court because States parties to the Pact of Bogota have agreed
in Article XXXII that a unilateral Application, based on the Pact of
Bogota, can only be made when the two conditions enumerated in (a) and
(b), paragraph 2 above, have been satisfied, and such is not the case with
the Application of Nicaragua.”

On behalf of the Republic of Nicaragua,
in the Counter-Memorial :

“A. On the basis of the foregoing facts and arguments the Government
of Nicaragua respectfully asks the Court to adjudge and declare that:

1. For the reasons set forth in this Counter-Memorial the purported
modifications of the Honduran Declaration dated 20 February 1960,
contained in the ‘Declaration’ dated 22 May 1986, are invalid and con-
sequently the ‘reservations’ invoked by Honduras in its Memorial are
without legal effect.

2. Alternatively, in case the Court finds that the modifications of the
Honduran ‘Declaration’ dated 22 May 1986 are valid, such modifications
cannot be invoked as against Nicaragua because on the facts Nicaragua
did not receive reasonable notice thereof.

3. Without prejudice to the foregoing submissions, the ‘reservations’

of the present case : thus —

(a) the dispute to which the Application of Nicaragua relates is not the
subject of any agreement by the Parties to resort to other means for the
pacific settlement of disputes; and, in particular, neither the Conta-
dora process nor the provisions of the Pact of Bogota constitute the
‘other means’ to which the pertinent reservation refers;

(b) the dispute to which the Application of Nicaragua relates is not a dis-
pute ‘relating to facts or situations originating in armed conflicts or
acts of a similar nature which may affect the territory of the Republic
of Honduras, and in which it may find itself involved directly or indi-
rectly’, and, in the alternative, the ‘reservation’ in question does not
possess an exclusively preliminary character and therefore the issue
of its application is postponed for determination at the stage of the
Merits.

4. The ‘reservations’ invoked by Honduras are not applicable in any
event to the provisions of Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogota, which
provides an independent basis of jurisdiction within the framework of
Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court.

5. The application of the provisions of Article XXXI of the Pact
of Bogota is not subject either to the conciliation procedure referred to in
Article XXXII of the Pact, exhaustion of which is a condition of recourse
to the Court exclusively within the context of Article XXXII, or to the con-
dition of an agreement upon an arbitral procedure which relates exclu-
sively to Article XXXII.

entertain” that Application; the Court will however first examine the
question of jurisdiction before proceeding, if it finds that it is competent,
to examine the issues of admissibility.

+ *

16. The Parties have devoted some argument to a question defined by
them as that of the burden of proof: whether it is for Nicaragua to show
the existence of jurisdiction for the Court to deal with its claims, or for
Honduras to establish the absence of such jurisdiction. Each of them has
cited, in support of its contention, the Court’s dictum that “it is the litigant


ARMED ACTIONS (JUDGMENT) 76

seeking to establish a fact who bears the burden of proving it” (Military
and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United
States of America), 1.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101).

The existence of jurisdiction of the Court in a given case is however not
a question of fact, but a question of law to be resolved in the light of the
relevant facts. The determination of the facts may raise questions of proof.
However the facts in the present case — the existence of the Parties’ dec-
larations under Article 36 of the Statute, the signature and ratification of
the Pact of Bogota, etc. — are not in dispute ; the issue is, what are the legal
effects to be attached to them ? The question is whether in case of doubt
the Court is to be deemed to have jurisdiction or not. This question has
already been considered by the Permanent Court of International Justice
in the case concerning the Factory at Chorzôw, Jurisdiction, when it
observed:

“It has been argued repeatedly in the course of the present pro-
ceedings that in case of doubt the Court should decline jurisdiction.
It is true that the Court’s jurisdiction is always a limited one, existing
only in so far as States have accepted it; consequently, the Court will,
in the event of an objection — or when it has automatically to con-
sider the question — only affirm its jurisdiction provided that the
force of the arguments militating in favour of it is preponderant. The
fact that weighty arguments can be advanced to support the con-
tention that it has no jurisdiction cannot of itself create a doubt
calculated to upset its jurisdiction. When considering whether it has.
jurisdiction or not, the Court’s aim is always to ascertain whether
an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer jurisdiction
upon it.” (P.C.IJ., Series A, No. 9, p. 32.)

The Court will therefore in this case have to consider whether the force of
the arguments militating in favour of jurisdiction is preponderant, and to
“ascertain whether an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer
jurisdiction upon it”.

17. In its Application instituting proceedings in this case, Nicaragua
refers, as basis of the jurisdiction of the Court, to

“the provisions of Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogota and to the
Declarations made by the Republic of Nicaragua and by the Repub-
lic of Honduras respectively, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court
as provided for in Article 36, paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively of the
Statute”

of the Court. In the submissions presented by Nicaragua in the Counter-
Memorial it is contended more specifically that


ARMED ACTIONS (JUDGMENT) 77

“The competence of the Court exists: by virtue of the Honduran
Declaration dated 20 February 1960 accepting the jurisdiction of the
Court in conformity with the provisions of Article 36, paragraph 2, of
the Statute of the Court; or (in case the Declaration of 1960 has been
validly modified) the Honduran Declaration of 1960 as modified
by the Declaration dated 22 May 1986, and the Nicaraguan Declara-
tion dated 24 September 1929; and/or by virtue of the provisions of
Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogota and Article 36, paragraph 1,
of the Statute of the Court.”

18. The Pact of Bogota was drafted and adopted at the Bogota Con-
ference in 1948, at the same time as the Charter of the Organization of
American States (OAS). Among the purposes of the OAS as proclaimed
in Article 2 of the Charter was the following:

“(b) to prevent possible causes of difficulties and to ensure the
pacific settlement of disputes that may arise among the Mem-
ber States.”

One Chapter of the Charter was devoted to Pacific Settlement of Dis-
-putes, and consisted of four Articles, originally numbered 20 to 23, which
read as follows:

“Article 20

All international disputes that may arise between American States
shall be submitted to the peaceful procedures set forth in this
Charter, before being referred to the Security Council of the United
Nations.

Article 21

The following are peaceful procedures: direct negotiation, good
offices, mediation, investigation and conciliation, judicial settle-
ment, arbitration, and those which the parties to the dispute may
especially agree upon at any time.

Article 22

In the event that a dispute arises between two or more American
States which, in the opinion of one of them, cannot be settled through
the usual diplomatic channels, the parties shall agree on some other
peaceful procedure that will enable them to reach a solution.

Article 23

A special treaty will establish adequate procedures for the pacific
settlement of disputes and will determine the appropriate means for
their application, so that no dispute between American States shall
fail of definitive settlement within a reasonable period.”


ARMED ACTIONS (JUDGMENT) 78

The Charter was amended by the Protocol of Buenos Aires in 1967, and
further amended by the Protocol of Cartagena de Indias in 1988. Nicara-
gua and Honduras are parties to the Charter, as successively amended.

19. The “special treaty” referred to in Article 23 of the Charter, quoted
above, is the Pact of Bogota, which states in its Preamble that it was con-
cluded “in fulfillment of Article XXIII of the Charter”. Nicaragua and
Honduras have since 1950 been parties to the Pact, in the case of Hon-
duras without reservation; Nicaragua appended a resérvation to its
signature to the Pact, which it maintained at the time of ratification.
The purpose of the reservation was to reserve the

“position assumed by the Government of Nicaragua with respect to
arbitral decisions the validity of which it has contested on the basis
of the principles of international law, which clearly permit arbitral
decisions to be attacked when they are adjudged to be null or
invalidated”.

It has not been contended that that reservation (to be referred to in another
context below, paragraph 40) in itself deprives the Court of any jurisdic-
tion in this case which it might have by virtue of the Pact.

20. Article XXXI of the Pact, upon which Nicaragua relies to found
jurisdiction, provides as follows:

“In conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice, the High Contracting Parties declare
that they recognize, in relation to any other American State, the juris-
diction of the Court as compulsory ipso facto, without the necessity of
any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in force, in all
disputes of a juridical nature that arise among them concerning:

(a) The interpretation of a treaty;

(b) Any question of international law;

(c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
the breach of an international obligation;

(d) The nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach
of an international obligation.”

21. The other basis of jurisdiction relied on by Nicaragua is constituted
by the declarations of acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction made by the
Parties under Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.

The jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36, paragraph 2, of its
Statute has been accepted by Honduras, initially by a Declaration made
on 2 February 1948, and deposited with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations on 10 February 1948, in the following terms:

[Translation from the Spanish]

- “The Executive of the Republic of Honduras, with due authoriza-
tion from the National Congress granted by Decree Number Ten of
the nineteenth of December, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and

in conformity with paragraph two of Article thirty-six of the Statute
of the International Court of Justice,

Hereby declares :

That it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special
agreement, in relation to any other State accepting the same obliga-
tion, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in all legal
disputes concerning:
