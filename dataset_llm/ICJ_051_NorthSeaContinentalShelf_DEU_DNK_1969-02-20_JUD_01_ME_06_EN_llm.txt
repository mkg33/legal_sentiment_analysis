In fact the Court, not having faced the question directly as I have
suggested, has been unable to avoid discussing a number of its aspects,
and coming back to the point throughout its reasoning. The Court has
in fact had to consider, with a view to the delimitation which is the
subject of the present cases, whether the continental shelf is the natural
prolongation of national territory under the sea, thus justifying the
delimitation of the areas naturally appertaining to each of the coastal
States and excluding the contention for a sharing out among such States;
or whether it is dependent on the idea of contiguity, of which the corollary
would be the equidistance rule, to be compulsorily applied to the delimi-
tation in question ‘; or whether again delimitation on the equidistance
basis 1s inherent in the concept of the continental shelf, or follows
implicitly from the exclusive nature of the rights recognized as belonging
to the coastal States !.


2. Atallevents there was no ground for accepting the opinion expressed
by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that the Court is not invited to
pronounce on the question of what part of the bed of the sea and of
the subsoil of the high seas should be considered, from the legal point
of view, as constituting the continental shelf. It must be borne in mind
that the integrity of the high seas, the freedom of which is hallowed by
a general custom, is in issue, and all States, not merely the Parties to
the disputes. are directly interested therein.

3. When this has been said, the question with which the Court was
faced first of all was whether there exists a general international con-
vention, within the meaning of Article 38, paragraph 1 (a), of its Statute,
which has modified the principle of the freedom of the high seas and
sanctioned the concept of the continental shelf.

continental shelf bordering on their respective territorial seas, the Parties
rely on the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Convention on the
Continental Shelf mentioned above. The Kingdom of the Netherlands
and the Kingdom of Denmark are obviously bound by the stipulations
of that Convention. The Federal Republic of Germany, which has not
ratified it, is nonetheless bound, by virtue of the principle of good faith
in international relations, as is every State as a result of a unilateral
declaration !, by the statements made in the Memorial, affirmed in the

4. Failing a general convention, as specified above, is there an inter-
national custom, as contemplated in paragraph 1 (h) of Article 38 of
the Statute of the Court, which has modified the principle of the freedom
of the high seas and sanctioned the concept of the continental shelf?

Pa

CONTINENTAL SHELF (SEP. OP. AMMOUN) 104

argument for stating that the concept of the continental shelf as opposed
to that of the freedom of the high seas, is not yet accepted in customary
international law. Proof of the formation of custom is not to be deduced
from statements in the text of a convention; it is in the practice of
States that it must be sought. Indeed, custom, which Article 38, para-
graph 1 (h), of the Statute of the Court takes as evidence of a general
practice accepted as law, or which the teaching of publicists, following
Gentilis !, interprets rather as a practice capable of demonstrating its
existence, requires the consent, express or tacit, of the generality of
States, as was taught by Grotius with reference to the customary law
of nations of the period. It is therefore a question of enquiring whether
such a practice is observed, not indeed unanimously, but, as is quite
clear from the above-mentioned Article, by the generality of States with
actual consciousness of submitting themselves to a legal obligation.


5. The facts which constitute the custom in question are to be found
in a series of acts, internal or international, showing an intention to
adapt the law of nations to social and economic evolution and to the
progress of knowledge; this evolution and this progress have given
impetus to the exploitation of the riches of the soil and subsoil of the
sea at ever-increasing depths, and to the use of new means of communi-
cation and transport which develop unceasingly, and to the extension,
sometimes ill-considered, of deep-sea fishing, which has its dangers for
the conservation of marine species and, in general, of the biological
resources which have become more and more necessary for the feeding
of rapidly growing populations.

is not yet such as to modify by agreement the international custom
concerning the high seas, it nonetheless constitutes, by the legal act of
its ratification, and by the deliberate legal fact of its mere signature, a
group of precedents which contribute, together with State practice, judi-
cial and arbitral decisions. resolutions of legal conterences and of inter-
national bodies, as well as the positions there taken up, to the elaboration
of the material element of custom.

Today it must be admitted that these encroachments on the high seas,
these derogations from the freedom thereof, beginning with the Truman
Proclamation of 28 September 1945, are the expression of new needs of
humanity. From this it may be deduced that just as reasons of an economic
nature concerning navigation and fishing justified the freedom of the
high seas, reasons of the same nature which are no less imperative,
concerning the production of new resources with a rich future, and their
conservation and their equitable division between nations, may hence-
forward justify the limitation of that freedom. Thus the American Pro-

7. 1f the concept of the continental shelf has thus been definitively
recognized, there remains a related question, namely the extent of the
continental shelf or its outer limit. This is a question which is subject
to controversy, and which caused the representative of the Federal
Republic of Germany to say: “a crucial question has not yet been settled
—what are the outer limits of the continental shelf towards the open
sea 47”

The interest of the question lics in the fact that a judgment stating the
principles and rules applicable to the delimitation of the continental
shelf should not allow it to be understood that the Court has accepted,
without examination, the concept of the continental shelf.

It is possible to enquire whether the delimitation of the continental
shelf appearing in Article 1 of the Convention has alone passed into
customary law, or whether the latter does not imply—as in the case of
historic waters-—other outer limits of the area of the high seas subjected
to the jurisdiction of the coastal State under the title of continental
shelf or of epicontinental platform, or under some other denomination.

piscatory riches secreted by its epicontinental platform, which it was
determined to preserve in order that the production of guano should not
be prejudiced, in the interest of the national economy, which incidentally
coincided with the interest of agricultural production throughout the
world *.

“Governments are bound to ensure for their peoples access to
necessary food supplies and to furnish them with the means of
developing their economy. It is therefore the duty of each Govern-
ment to ensure the conservation and protection of its natural re-
sources and to regulate the use thereof to the greatest possible
advantage of its country, Hence it is likewise the duty of each
Government to prevent the said resources from being used outside
the area of its jurisdiction so as to endanger their existence, integrity
and conservation to the prejudice of peoples so situated geographi-
cally that their seas are irreplaceable sources of essential food and
economic materials. For the foregoing reasons the Governments of
Chile, Ecuador and Peru, being resolved to preserve for and make
available to their respective peoples the natural resources of the
areas adjacent to their coasts, . . . declare as follows:

Owing to the geological and biological factors affecting the exis-
tence, conservation and development of the marine fauna and flora,
. .. the former extent of the territorial sea and contiguous zone is
insufficient . . . [for] those resources, to which the coastal countries
are entitled ... [They] therefore proclaim as a principle of their
international maritime policy that each of them possesses sole
sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area of sea adjacent to the
coast of its own country and extending not less than 200 nautical
miles from the said coast.

cribed includes sole sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea floor

extremely varied formulae which have been employed, unless it be that
they constitute a set of methods to which States might freely have

seen whether those which have occurred since the signature of the Con-
vention on the Continental Shelf, by being added thereto, have had this
effect.

In order to resolve this question, the Court argues that a norm-
creating convention has, as such, an influence on the formation of custom.

like the Truman Proclamation, as starting a trend towards a new custom.


Thus, finally, in the course of the decade which has elapsed since the
institution of the new rule by treaty, a dozen States not parties to the
1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf can be counted which have
opted, in addition to the signatory States of that Convention, for the
equidistance method.

of the continental shelf of the south-west coast ought necessarily to
reach the median line between the continent and the British Isles, which
however is anything but proved. In fact, the question being that of
determining the lateral boundaries between the areas of continental

To sum up, I am in agreement with the majority of the Court in
declaiing that the equidistance method provided for in Article 6, para-
graph 2, of the 1958 Convention, is not opposable as a rule of treaty-law
to the Federal Republic of Germany, and that this rule has also not up
to the present time become a rule of customary law.

On the other hand, I consider that recourse may be had to the equi-
distance method, qualified by special circumstances, as a legal rule
applicable to the case and derived from a general principle of law, namely
equity praeter legem.

Since the Court has, for the reasons which it has set forth, not con-
sidered that it should go as far as I have done, I have felt that I should,
with all the consideration to which it is entitled, and while supporting
the Judgment, append thereto the present separate opinion, covering the
points on which my reasoning has been different, or on which I have
come to a different conclusion.
