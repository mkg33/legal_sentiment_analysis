of the League as an organization, and the substantive provisions of
the instrument of Mandate for South West Africa. The question now
to be considered is whether there is anything arising out of its previous
Judgment, or the terms of the jurisdictional clause of the Mandate,
which should lead the Court to modify the conclusions arrived at on
those foundations.

59. In the first place, it is contended that the question of the Applicants’
legal right or interest was settled by that Judgment and cannot now
be reopened. As regards the issue of preclusion, the Court finds it un-
necessary to pronounce on various issues which have been raised in
this connection, such as whether a decision on a preliminary objection
constitutes a res judicata in the proper sense of that term,—whether
it ranks as a “decision” for the purposes of Article 59 of the Court’s



Statute, or as “final” within the meaning of Article 60. The essential
point is that a decision on a preliminary objection can never be preclusive
of a matter appertaining to the merits, whether or not it has in fact
been dealt with in connection with the preliminary objection. When
preliminary objections are entered by the defendant party in a case,
the proceedings on the merits are, by virtue of Article 62, paragraph 3,
of the Court’s Rules, suspended. Thereafter, and until the proceedings

that negotiations had taken place; that these had not settled the dispute;
and that the Court was, by the operation of Article 37 of its Statute,
duly substituted for the Permanent Court as the competent forum
(all of which assumptions would be in accordance with the Court’s



Judgment of 1962);—then all that the Applicants had to do in order
to bring themselves under this clause and establish their capacity to
invoke it, was to show (a) ratione personae, that they were members
of the League, constructively if not actually, or must be deemed still
so to be for the purposes of this provision, notwithstanding the dissolu-
tion of the League; and (b) ratione materiae, that the dispute did relate
to the interpretation or application of one or more provisions of the
Mandate. If the Court considered that these requirements were satisfied,
it could assume jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits without
going into the question of the Applicants’ legal right or interest relative
to the subject-matter of their claim; for the jurisdictional clause did
not, according to its terms, require them to establish the existence of
such a right or interest for the purpose of founding the competence
of the Court.

61. Hence, whatever observations the Court may have made on that
matter, it remained for the Applicants, on the merits, to establish that they
had this right or interest in the carrying out of the provisions which they
invoked, such as to entitle them to the pronouncements and declarations
they were seeking from the Court. Since decisions of an interlocutory
character cannot pre-judge questions of merits, there can be no contra-
diction between a decision allowing that the Applicants had the capacity
to invoke the jurisdictional clause—this being the only question which,
so far as this point goes, the Court was then called upon to decide, or
could decide,—and a decision that the Applicants have not established
the legal basis of their claim on the merits.

62. It is next contended that this particular jurisdictional clause has an
effect which is more extensive than if it is considered as a simple juris-

as mandates. That such disputes could arise does not seem to have been
envisaged. In the same way, the original drafts of the ‘C’ mandates
which, in a different form, contained broadly all that now appears in
the first four articles of the Mandate for South West Africa, had no
jurisdictional clause and no “missionary clause” either. The one appeared
when the other did.

78. The inference to be drawn from this drafting history is confirmed
by the very fact that the question of a right of recourse to the Court arose



only at the stage of the drafting of the instruments of mandate, and that
as already mentioned, no such right figured among the “securities”
for the performance of the sacred trust embodied in the League Covenant.

79. After going through various stages, the jurisdictional clause finally
appeared in the same form in all the mandates, except that in the case
of the Mandate for Tanganyika (as it then was) a drafting caprice
caused the retention of an additional paragraph which did not appear,
or had been dropped in all the other cases. Once the principle of a juris-
dictional clause had been accepted, the clause was then introduced as
a matter of course into all the mandates. This furnishes the answer
to the contention that, in the case of the ‘C’ mandates, it must have been
intended to relate to something more than the single “missionary clause”
(Article 5 in the Mandate for South West Africa). Also, it must not
be forgotten that it was simultaneously with the missionary clause
that the jurisdictional clause was introduced ; and that at the time much
importance was attached to missionary rights. In any event, whatever
the purpose of the jurisdictional clause, it was the same for all the
mandates, and for the three categories of mandate. It is in the light
of the mandates system generally that this purpose must be assessed,
—and, so considered, the purpose is clear.

80. The Court will now consider a final contention which has been ad-
vanced in support of the Applicants’ claim of right, namely the so-called
“necessity’’ argument.

81. In order to do this, and at the risk of some unavoidable repetition, it
is necessary to review a little more closely the functioning of the mandates
system. This system, within the larger setting of the League, was an
entirely logical one. The various mandatories did not deal with the indi-
vidual members of the League over the “conduct” provisions of their
mandates, but with the appropriate League organs. If any difficulty
should arise over the interpretation of any mandate, or the character
of the mandatory’s obligations, which could not be cleared up by dis-
cussion or reference to an ad hoc committee of jurists—a frequent
practice in the League—the Council could in the last resort request the
Permanent Court for an advisory opinion. Such an opinion would not
of course be binding on the mandatory—it was not intended that it
should be—but it would assist the work of the Council.

82. In the Council, which the mandatory was entitled to attend as a
member for the purposes of any mandate entrusted to it, if not otherwise
a member—(Article 4, paragraph 5, of the Covenant), the vote of the
mandatory, if present at the meeting, was necessary for any actual
“decision” of the Council, since unanimity of those attending was the
basic voting rule on matters of substance in the main League organs—
(Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Covenant). Thus there could never be
any formal clash between the mandatory and the Council as such.
In practice, the unanimity rule was frequently not insisted upon, or its



impact was mitigated by a process of give-and-take, and by various
procedural devices to which both the Council and the mandatories lent
themselves. So far as the Court’s information goes, there never occurred
any case in which a mandatory “vetoed” what would otherwise have
been a Council decision. Equally, however, much trouble was taken
to avoid situations in which the mandatory would have been forced
to acquiesce in the views of the rest of the Council short of casting an
adverse vote. The occasional deliberate absence of the mandatory
from a meeting, enabled decisions to be taken that the mandatory might
have felt obliged to vote against if it had been present. This was part
of the above-mentioned process for arriving at generally acceptable
conclusions.

83. Such were the methods, broadly speaking, adopted in the relations
between the various mandatories and the League over the conduct of the
mandates, and it can be seen how out of place in the context would
have been the existence of substantive rights for individual members
of the League in the conduct of the mandates (particularly if backed up
by a right of recourse to the Court) exercisable independently of the
Council at the will of the member State. On the other hand—and here
again the concept was entirely logical—by the combined effect of the
“special interests” provisions and the jurisdictional clause—(the latter
alone could not have sufficed)—a right of recourse was given to the
individual League members in respect of such interests, since the League

was remote, the event proved. Acceptance of the Applicants’ contention
on the other hand, would involve acceptance of the proposition that
even if the Council of the League should be perfectly satisfied with the
way in which a mandatory was carrying out its mandate, any individual



member of the League could independently invoke the jurisdiction of
the Court in order to have the same conduct declared illegal, although,
as mentioned earlier, no provision for recourse to the Court was included
amongst the “securities” provided for by the Covenant itself. Here
again the difference is evident between this case and that of the minorities,
where it was the members of the Council itself who had that right.
The potential existence of such a situation as would have arisen from
investing all the members of the League with the right in question is
not reconcilable with the processes described above for the supervision
of the mandates. According to the methods and procedures of the League
as applied to the operation of the mandates system, it was by argument,
discussion, negotiation and co-operative effort that matters were to be,
and were, carried forward.

88. For these reasons the Court, bearing in mind that the rights of the
Applicants must be determined by reference to the character of the
system said to give rise to them, considers that the “necessity” argument
falls to the ground for lack of verisimilitude in the context of the economy
and philosophy of that system. Looked at in another way moreover,
the argument amounts to a plea that the Court should allow the equiva-
lent of an “actio popularis”, or right resident in any member of a com-
munity to take legal action in vindication of a public interest. But
although a right of this kind may be known to certain municipal systems
of law, it is not known to international law as it stands at present:
nor is the Court able to regard it as imported by the “general principles
of law” referred to in Article 38, paragraph 1 (c), of its Statute.

Applicants cannot be considered to have established any legal right or
interest appertaining to them in the subject-matter of the present claims,
and that, accordingly, the Court must decline to give effect to them.

100. For these reasons,

THE COURT,
by the President’s casting vote—the votes being equally divided,

decides to reject the claims of the Empire of Ethiopia and the Republic
of Liberia.
