       1. In the present case, the Court considers that Venezuela’s preliminary objection that the
United Kingdom is an indispensable third party is not barred by the force of res judicata of the
2020 Judgment on jurisdiction and concludes that it is admissible (Judgment, paras. 70 and 74). The
Court explains that its jurisprudence on the Monetary Gold principle is premised on a distinction
between the existence and the exercise of its jurisdiction, and that Venezuela’s objection is an
objection to the exercise of its jurisdiction and does not constitute an objection to jurisdiction
(para. 64).

       2. Venezuela contends that its objection is an objection to the admissibility of the Application
and not to the Court’s jurisdiction (Preliminary Objections of Venezuela, para. 12; CR 2022/21,
pp. 24-25, paras. 16-18 (Zimmermann); CR 2022/23, pp. 21-26, paras. 2-28 (Zimmermann)). By
contrast, Guyana argues that it is an objection to jurisdiction and not to admissibility. The Court
rejects this argument of Guyana.

       3. The Court has considered objections based on the Monetary Gold principle as concerned
with admissibility and not the Court’s jurisdiction. In the Monetary Gold case, the Court found that
although the parties had conferred jurisdiction upon the Court, it could not “exercise this jurisdiction”
(Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, and United States of America), Preliminary Question, Judgment, I.C.J.
Reports 1954, p. 33; emphasis added). In the Nauru case, the Court first examined Australia’s
objection to jurisdiction and only subsequently considered its objection based on the Monetary Gold
principle. The Court rejected the latter objection, stating that it could not decline to “exercise its
jurisdiction” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 262, para. 55; emphasis added). In the East Timor case, after
determining that it had jurisdiction, the Court concluded that it could not “exercise the jurisdiction it
has” (East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 105, para. 35; emphasis
added).

      4. The Court has elucidated the character of objections to admissibility in the following terms:

             “Objections to admissibility normally take the form of an assertion that, even if
      the Court has jurisdiction and the facts stated by the applicant State are assumed to be
      correct, nonetheless there are reasons why the Court should not proceed to an
      examination of the merits.” (Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), Preliminary Objections,
      Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 456, para. 120, citing Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic
      of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 177, para. 29.)

An objection based on the Monetary Gold principle is one such objection calling for the Court not to
exercise its jurisdiction and not to proceed to an examination of the merits. In the Military
and Paramilitary Activities case, the Court expressly described the objection of the United States
based on the Monetary Gold principle as one concerning the admissibility of the application (Military
and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America),
Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 429, para. 84, and p. 431,

                                                           -2-

para. 88) 1. In discussing an objection based on the Monetary Gold principle before the Court, parties
have likewise treated it as one concerned with admissibility 2. Venezuela’s objection that the
United Kingdom is an indispensable third party is not an objection to the Court’s jurisdiction but an
objection to admissibility.
