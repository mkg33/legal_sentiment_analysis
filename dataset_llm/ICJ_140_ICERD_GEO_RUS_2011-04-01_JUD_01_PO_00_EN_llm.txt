                   OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION
                    ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS





                 Article 22 of CERD invoked by Georgia as a basis for the jurisdiction of the
               Court — Four preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court raised by the
               Russian Federation.

                                                        *
                  First preliminary objection – Existence of a dispute.
                  Contention by the Russian Federation that there is no dispute between the Par-
               ties with respect to the interpretation or application of CERD — Meaning of the
               word “dispute” in Article 22 of CERD — Evidence as to the existence of a “dispute”
               — The Court limits itself to official documents and statements — Distinction
               between documents and statements issued before and after CERD entered into
               force between the Parties — Primary attention given by the Court to statements
               made or endorsed by the Executives — Agreements and the Security Council reso-
               lutions relating to the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

                  Documents and statements from the period before CERD entered into force
               between the Parties — No legal significance given by the Court to these documents
               and statements for the purposes of the case — No basis for a finding that there was
               a dispute between the Parties about racial discrimination by July 1999 — Even if
               there had been such a dispute prior to 2 July 1999, it could not have been a dispute
               with respect to the interpretation or application of CERD.



72 	        convention on racial discrimination (judgment)

   Documents and statements from the period after CERD entered into force
between the Parties and before August 2008 — Reports made after 1999 to human
rights treaty monitoring committees — No allegations of non-compliance by the
Russian Federation with its obligations under CERD — Reports to the committees
not significant in determining the existence of a dispute — Documents and state-
ments issued by the Parties during this period — No legal significance for the
purposes of the case — No legal dispute between Georgia and the Russian Federa-
tion during that period with respect to the interpretation or application of CERD.


  Events in August 2008 — Documents and statements issued in the period
between the beginning of armed hostilities and the filing of the Application —
Georgia’s claims expressly referred to alleged ethnic cleansing by Russian forces —
Claims made against the Russian Federation directly and rejected by the latter —
Existence of a dispute between the Parties about the Russian Federation’s
compliance with its obligations under CERD.

    First preliminary objection dismissed.

                                             *
    Second preliminary objection — Procedural conditions in Article 22 of CERD.

   Contention by the Russian Federation that two procedural preconditions in Arti-
cle 22 of CERD were not met — Question of whether Article 22 establishes pre-
conditions for the seisin of the Court — Ordinary meaning of Article 22 of
CERD — The Court’s Order on Provisional Measures without prejudice to the
definitive decision as to its jurisdiction to deal with the merits — Functions of the
requirement for prior resort to negotiations — Reference in Article 22 of CERD to
“negotiation or [to] the procedures expressly provided for” in CERD — Words
“dispute . . . which is not settled” by the means of peaceful resolution specified in
Article 22 must be given effect — Express choice of two modes of dispute settle-
ment, namely negotiations or resort to special procedures under CERD, suggests
an affirmative duty to resort to them prior to the seisin of the Court — Use of
future perfect tense in the French version of the expression “which is not settled”
reinforces the idea that an attempt to settle the dispute must have taken place
