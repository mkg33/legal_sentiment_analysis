                       1. I am not persuaded that the Court has jurisdiction ratione temporis
                    to adjudicate facts or events which took place after 27 November 2013,
                    the date on which the Pact of Bogotá ceased to be in force with respect to
                    Colombia. I therefore voted against subparagraphs 1 to 4 of the operative
                    clause of the Judgment by which the Court recognizes and exercises juris-
                    diction with regard to such facts or events (Judgment, para. 261).
                       2. The jurisdiction of the Court with respect to events which occurred
                    after 27 November 2013 turns on the interpretation of Articles XXXI and
                    LVI of the Pact of Bogotá. Pursuant to Article XXXI, the States parties
                    recognize the jurisdiction of the Court in “all disputes of a juridical
                    nature” “so long as the present Treaty is in force”. Article LVI provides
                    that the Pact “may be denounced upon one year’s notice, at the end of
                    which period it shall cease to be in force with respect to the State denounc-
                    ing it”.
                       3. The Court has repeatedly emphasized “that its jurisdiction is based
                    on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by
                    them” 1. Thus, the Court does not, as a general rule, have jurisdiction
                    over events occurring after the lapse of a treaty that is the basis of its
                    jurisdiction. In the present case, however, the majority finds that this does
                    not apply to such subsequent events if they “ar[i]se directly out of the
                    question which is the subject-­matter of the Application” and if they “are
                    connected to the alleged incidents that have already been found to fall
                    within the Court’s jurisdiction”, as long as “consideration of those alleged
                    incidents does not transform the nature of the dispute between the Parties
                    in the present case” (ibid., para. 47). To reach this conclusion, the major-
                    ity finds that “considerations that have been brought to bear on the adju-
                    dication of a claim or submission made after the filing of an application
                    can be instructive in the present case” and that
                          “the criteria that it has considered relevant in its jurisprudence to
                          determine the limits ratione temporis of its jurisdiction with respect to
                          such a claim or submission, or the admissibility thereof, should apply
                          to the Court’s examination of the scope of its jurisdiction ratione tem‑
                          poris in the present case” (ibid., para. 43).
                     4. I do not find this reasoning convincing. The criteria to which the
                    majority refers are not apposite in the present case. All but one of the

                    decisions cited in support concern the admissibility of late claims, not the
                    jurisdiction of the Court ratione temporis, while the one remaining deci-
                    sion offers an obiter dictum which only nominally addresses jurisdiction
                    ratione temporis.
                       5. In its judgments regarding the admissibility of late claims, the Court
                    indeed examined whether the claims in question “arose directly out of the
                    question which is the subject-­     matter of the application” (Judgment,
                    para. 47). In those cases, however, the applicant State would have been
                    entitled to submit a new application in respect of the late claims, because
                    the basis for the jurisdiction of the Court was still in force. The Court could
                    thus accept the addition of those claims simply for reasons of judicial econ-
                    omy 2. It is quite a different matter to extend the jurisdiction of the Court
                    on the basis of this criterion. The Court, after all, regularly emphasizes the
                    importance of the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility:
                             “When . . . consent [to jurisdiction] is expressed in a compromissory
                          clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such
                          consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon.
                          The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such condi-
                          tions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the appli-
                          cation” 3.
                       6. In addition to the jurisprudence of the Court on the admissibility of
                    late claims, the majority refers to Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in
                    Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France) (hereinafter “Djibouti v. France”)
                    (Judgment, para. 44). This case turned on an extraordinary basis of juris-
                    diction, forum prorogatum, and therefore did not involve the interpretation
                    of either a compromissory clause or a declaration under Article 36, para-
                    graph 2, of the Statute of the Court. Djibouti v. France concerned, inter alia,
                    facts which occurred after the filing of the Application, which were then
                    examined by the Court to determine whether they had a “connect[ion] to
                    the facts or events already falling within the Court’s jurisdiction” and
                    “whether consideration of those later facts or events would transform the
                    ‘nature of the dispute’” 4. However, as the majority acknowledges (ibid.),
                    Djibouti v. France did not concern a limitation of the Court’s jurisdiction
                    ratione temporis, but rather the question of its jurisdiction ratione mat­
                    eriae 5. The element from Djibouti v. France on which the majority relies in
                    the present case is in fact an obiter dictum, which purports to summarize

                       7. For these reasons, I do not think that the conclusion of the majority
                    regarding jurisdiction ratione temporis finds significant support in the
                    jurisprudence of the Court 7. As the majority recognizes, the present case
                    raises a question which has not previously been presented to the Court
                    (Judgment, para. 43). Under these circumstances, it is not sufficient, in
                    my view, for the Court to simply state that “the criteria that it has consid-
                    ered relevant in its jurisprudence” “can be instructive” and “should
                    apply” in the present case (ibid.).
                       8. A better reason for the Court to assume jurisdiction in the present
                    case with respect to events occurring after 27 November 2013 could be that
                    the term “dispute” should be interpreted as necessarily including all events
                    which take place before the opening of the oral proceedings, and which are
                    encompassed by the legal claim submitted to the Court. Such an interpreta-
                    tion of the term “dispute” is conceivable, based on the assumption that,
                    once a dispute is brought before the Court, it acquires an existence which is
                    independent of temporal restrictions. However, it is also clear that the par-
                    ties may limit such a temporal effect of the term “dispute”.
                       9. Thus, the question in the present case is whether the parties to the
                    Pact of Bogotá intended to limit the temporal scope of the jurisdiction
                    conferred on the Court by excluding facts or events which occur after the
                    treaty ceases to be in force for a State party. This question should, in my
                    view, be answered by way of a specific interpretation of Articles XXXI
                    and LVI of the Pact of Bogotá, and not by applying certain elements of
                    the Court’s jurisprudence which concern other legal questions.

                       10. The customary rules on the interpretation of treaties, which are
                    reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
                    Treaties, provide the means and a methodology for identifying the inten-

                       7 Moreover, the Court has only recognized the possibility to present additional facts to

                    a claim in situations in which it had jurisdiction ratione temporis with respect to such facts,

                    tion of the parties to a treaty 8. In the present case, an application of the
                    general rule of interpretation (Art. 31) to Article XXXI of the Pact of
                    Bogotá does not lead to a clear conclusion: the ordinary meaning of the
                    term “dispute” may be broad; but the ordinary meaning of the phrase “so
                    long as the present Treaty is in force” is also broad. Being each a part of
                    the context of the other, both terms must be taken into account when
                    determining their respective meaning. The object and purpose of the
                    treaty, which is the pacific “settlement of controversies” (Art. I), may
                    speak in favour of a broad understanding of the term “dispute”, but this
                    should not override the weight to be given to a specific limitation to the
                    jurisdiction of the Court which the States parties have chosen to include
                    in Article XXXI, and the object and purpose of that limitation.

                       11. Supplementary means of interpretation (Art. 32) include, but are
                    not limited to, the travaux préparatoires 9. It is not entirely clear why,
                    when negotiating and concluding the Pact of Bogotá, the parties opted to
                    include in Article XXXI the phrase “so long as the present Treaty is in
                    force” or exactly how this phrase was intended to operate as a temporal
                    limitation 10. The travaux of the Ninth International Conference of Amer-
                    ican States held in Bogotá from 30 March to 2 May 1948, notably the
                    debate of 27 April 1948, nevertheless suggest that a cautious approach
                    should be taken by the Court. The travaux indicate that Article XXXI,
                    which contains elements of Article 36, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Court’s
                    Statute, has a hybrid character 11. They also suggest that the formulation
                    “so long as the present Treaty is in force” resulted from an attempt to
                    convince reluctant OAS Member States to agree on the far-­reaching step
                    of establishing “a co‑ordinated system of dispute settlement procedures” 12
                    on the basis of a multilateral treaty with the compulsory jurisdiction of
                    the ICJ over all their legal disputes at its core. It is also noteworthy that
                    the formulation “so long as the present treaty is in force” is contained
                    neither in Article 36 of the Court’s Statute nor in other important and
                    well‑known compromissory clauses which were adopted shortly after
                    Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá, notably Article 17 of the 1949 Revised

                    ­ rticle 1 of the 1957 European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of
                    A
                    Disputes 13. Even if this observation does not lead to a clear conclusion
                    either, it highlights the specific character of Article XXXI. This context
                    should inform the Court’s determination of the parties’ presumed inten-
                    tion 14. The context does not, for example, suggest that the Court held, or
                    intended to hold, in Border and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v.
                    Honduras), that the significance of the phrase “so long as the present
                    treaty is in force” is confined to “limit[ing] the period within which such a
                    dispute must have arisen” (see Judgment, para. 40).

                       12. In my view, the preceding considerations and a good faith assess-
                    ment of the parties’ presumed intentions indicate that, in principle, a ter-
                    mination under Article XXXI has the effect of precluding the Court’s
                    consideration of facts or events which occur after the treaty has expired
                    for a party, including events which would have been part of a dispute had
                    the jurisdictional basis not expired. This conclusion is justified because
                    the parties cannot be presumed to have intended to extend the jurisdic-
                    tion of the Court to what are severable factual elements which could not
                    have been submitted independently after the expiration of the Court’s
                    jurisdictional basis.

                      13. The specific role of the Court in the peaceful settlement of disputes
                    and the distinct judicial character of its proceedings do not, in my view,
                    require that a dispute over which the Court has jurisdiction cover all facts
                    or events which occur before the opening of the oral proceedings. Facts
                    or events which occur prior to the lapse of the Court’s jurisdiction usually
                    are an independent and sufficient basis for the adjudication of a claim by
                    the Court. Moreover, applying the general effect of a lapse of jurisdiction
                    to subsequent events does not risk a denial of justice 15.

                      14. This may not be the case if acts which occur before the lapse of
                    jurisdiction are so closely connected to acts which occur after the lapse of
                    jurisdiction that their legal significance is affected by the latter. Acts, or

                    Article 15 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State
                    Responsibility may fall in this category. In the present case, however, the
                    legal significance of the incidents alleged by Nicaragua to have taken
                    place before 27 November 2013 is not affected by the incidents which
                    allegedly took place after the lapse of the jurisdictional basis. The latter
                    are merely additional incidents.

                                                           *
                       15. Nicaragua has not proven any of the incidents alleged to have
                    occurred before 27 November 2013. The Miss Sofia incident of 17 Novem-
                    ber 2013 is the only one of 13 incidents alleged to have taken place before
                    27 November 2013 which the Court considers to be worthy of a closer
                    examination and not subject to an implicit dismissal.
                       16. The Court finds it to be established that the alleged Miss Sofia inci-
                    dent was one of those in which Colombian frigates were operating at the
                    locations indicated by Nicaragua and that “Colombia’s own naval reports
                    and navigation logs . . . corroborate the specific geographic co‑ordinates
                    presented by Nicaragua, which lie within . . . the maritime area that was
                    declared by the Court to appertain to Nicaragua” (Judgment, para. 91).
                    Significantly, however, the Court does not list the alleged Miss Sofia inci-
                    dent among those incidents with respect to which it considers it to be
                    established that “Colombian naval vessels purported to exercise enforce-
                    ment jurisdiction in Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone” (ibid.,
                    para. 92). The mere fact that a Colombian naval vessel was operating
                    within the exclusive economic zone of Nicaragua does not, as such, con-
                    stitute a violation of Nicaragua’s rights. Such conduct may have been a
                    lawful exercise of its freedom of navigation. Thus, by — correctly —
                    drawing only a very limited conclusion from the evidence presented by
                    the Parties with respect to the alleged Miss Sofia incident, the Court in
                    effect acknowledges that Nicaragua has not proven any of the incidents
                    which allegedly took place before 27 November 2013, the date on which
                    the Pact of Bogotá expired for Colombia.


                       17. I do not disregard the fact that Colombia, through various statements
                    of high-­ranking officials and communications from its naval vessels, did not
                    recognize the 2012 Judgment of the Court, including the delimitation of
                    Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone resulting therefrom, for at least one
                    year. Such conduct is deeply regrettable and has even given rise to a plausi-
                    ble suspicion that its naval vessels have violated Nicaragua’s sovereign rights
                    and jurisdiction. Nevertheless, an initial public criticism of a judgment of the
                    Court does not, as such, constitute a violation of the other party’s rights,
                    and a plausible suspicion is not sufficient to prove an incident.
