In that judgment the Court decided that it had jurisdiction
to assess the amount of compensation but stated that it
could not do so in the same judgment, as the Albanian Govern-
ment had not yet stated which items, if any, of the various sums
claimed it contested, and as the United Kingdom Government
had not submitted its evidence with regard thereto. The Court
therefore stated that further proceedings on this subject were
necessary and that the order and time-limits of these proceedings
would bc fixed by an order of the same date.

As has bcen said above, the Albanian Government dis-
puted the jurisdiction of the Court with regard to the assess-
ment of damages. The Court may confine itself to stating
that this jurisdiction was established by its Judgment of
April gth, 1949 ; that, in accordance with the Statute (Article 60),
which, for the settlement of the present dispute, is binding upon
the Albanian Government, that Judgment is final and without
appeal, and that therefore the matter is res judicata.

The position adopted bv the Albanian Government brings
into operation Article 53 of the Statute, which applies to procedure
in default of appearance. This Article entitles the United Kingdom
Government to call upon the Court to decide in favour of its
claim, and, on the other hand, obliges the Court to satisfy itself
that the claim is well founded in fact and law. While Article 53
thus obliges the Court to consider the submissions of the Party
which appears, it does not compel the Court to examine their
accuracy in all their details ; for this might in certain unopposed
cases prove impossible in practice. It is sufficient for the Court
to convince itself by such methods as it considers suitable that
the submissions are well founded.

It was in view of these considerations and on account of the
technical nature of the questions involved in the assessment of
compensation in the present case that the Court ordered the expert
enquiry mentioned above.

The Court considers the true measure of compensation in
the present case to be the replacement cost of the Saurmarez
at the time of its loss. The Court is of the opinion that the
amount of compensation claimed by the United Kingdom Govern-
ment has been justified. It cannot award more than the amount
claimed in the submissions of the United Kingdom Government.

The Court considers that the figures submitted by the United
Kingdom Government are reasonable and that its claim is well
founded. In this matter it takes note of the following conclusion
in the experts’ Report : ‘During their enquiry and calculations,
and as a result of their experience and of the information placed
before them, the experts have become convinced that the claim
of £ 703,809 submitted by the United Kingdom Government may
be taken as a fair and accurate estimate of the damage sustained.”

This expenditure has been proved to the satisfaction of the
Court by the documents produced by the United Kingdom Govern-
ment as Annexes 12 and 13 to its Memorial, and by the supple-
mentary information and corrections made thereto in Appendices I,
IT and III of that Government’s Observations of July 28th, 1949.

FOR THESE REASONS,
THE COURT,
by twelve votes to two,

Gives judgment in favour of the claim of the Government of
the United Kingdom, and

Fixes the amount of compensation due from the People’s
Republic of Albania to the United Kingdom at £ 843,947.

Judge KrYyLov declares that he is unable to agree either with
the operative clause or with the reasons for the Judgment.

Judge ECER, judge ad hoc, declaring that he is unable to
concur in the Judgment of the Court, has availed himself of the

right conferred on him by Article 57 of the Statute and appended
to the Judgment a statement of his dissenting opinion.
