                   Disagreement with the parts of the Judgment relating to jurisdiction ratione
                temporis and the “integral contiguous zone” — Question of the Court’s jurisdiction
                over facts subsequent to 27 November 2013 not settled by the 2016 Judgment —
                Lack of relevance of the precedents invoked because of the novel character of the
                question — Difficulty in reconciling Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá with the
                idea that the Court can exercise jurisdiction over facts subsequent to the
                denunciation of the Pact — Precedents to which the Court refers relate to
                admissibility rather than jurisdiction — Relative flexibility of the jurisprudence on
                the admissibility of new claims filed in the course of proceedings — Rigour required
                in respect of jurisdiction — Situation in which the facts form an indivisible whole —
                Dissociable character in this instance of the facts subsequent and prior to the
                critical date — Too abstract an approach to the problem of the “integral contiguous
                zone” — Nicaragua’s claim limited to alleged violations of its rights in its exclusive
                economic zone — Questions of the conformity with international law of the
                “integral contiguous zone” and of respect for the rights invoked by Nicaragua do
                not fully coincide — “Sovereign rights” and “jurisdiction” of the coastal State
                deriving from the customary rule reflected in Article 56, paragraph 1 (a) and (b),
                of UNCLOS should serve as reference points for the examination to be
                undertaken — Colombia’s promulgation of Decree 1946 cannot in itself be
                regarded as constituting an internationally wrongful act — Possibility to interpret
                the Decree, at the implementation stage, in a manner consistent with Nicaragua’s
                rights.

                  1. I disagree with the present Judgment on two points: the Court’s
                jurisdiction ratione temporis and Colombia’s “integral contiguous zone”.
                Because of my disagreement on these two points, I had to vote against
                most of the subparagraphs of the operative clause.

                             I. The Court’s Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis

                   2. Some of the actions which Nicaragua attributes to Colombia, and
                which, according to the Applicant, constitute violations of its rights in the
                maritime areas that fall under its jurisdiction by virtue of the 2012 Judg-
                ment whereby the Court fixed the maritime boundary between the two
                Parties, took place after 27 November 2013. On that date, the title of
                jurisdiction enabling the Court to entertain the present dispute ceased to
                have effect, since Colombia had given notice of its denunciation of the
                Pact of Bogotá on 27 November 2012. The Respondent contested the
                Court’s jurisdiction to examine and rule on the lawfulness of events that
                occurred after 27 November 2013, and the Court rejected that objection
                in its Judgment and agreed to extend its examination to all the facts
                alleged by Nicaragua, irrespective of whether they occurred before or

                after the date on which its jurisdictional title ceased to have effect. It is on
                this point that I disagree.
                   3. I shall start by making two preliminary observations.
                   First, the Judgment on the preliminary objections raised by Colombia
                rendered in 2016 in the present case failed to resolve the question of juris-
                diction ratione temporis either explicitly or implicitly. It did not resolve it
                explicitly because the question was not raised by the Respondent, which
                argued that the Court had no jurisdiction at all over the dispute, since, in
                its view, its denunciation of the Pact of Bogotá had taken effect immedi-
                ately as far as the jurisdictional clause was concerned (an argument which
                the Court rejected). Nor did the 2016 Judgment resolve the matter implic-
                itly. It would be going too far to maintain that in finding that it had
                jurisdiction over the dispute concerning Colombia’s alleged violations of
                Nicaragua’s rights in the maritime areas claimed by the Applicant (rightly,
                moreover) to have been adjudged to appertain to it in the 2012 Judgment,
                the Court had implicitly settled the question of the scope ratione temporis
                of its jurisdiction, a matter which the Parties did not discuss before the
                Court at all. Besides, Nicaragua made no attempt to claim that there was
                a res judicata deriving from the 2016 Judgment that would prevent the
                Court, at the current stage of the proceedings, from adopting a position
                consistent with Colombia’s argument in respect of jurisdiction ratione tem­
                poris.
                   4. Secondly, none of the precedents to which the Parties may have
                referred directly settles the point of law submitted to the Court in the
                present case. This is because the Court has never, in practice, found itself
                in a situation where it has had to determine the effects of the lapse of its
                jurisdictional title on its ability to examine facts subsequent to that lapse,
                in the context of a case already pending before it on the date when the
                jurisdictional title ceased to have effect. The Court, moreover, acknowl-
                edges this in the present Judgment, in paragraph 43. It was therefore
                incumbent on it to establish its jurisprudence in this regard. It does so,
                but in a way that I find open to criticism.
                   5. The jurisdictional basis for the Court to entertain the part of the
                dispute concerning the various actions that Nicaragua attributes to
                Colombia, which, according to the Applicant, took place in its exclusive
                economic zone, and each one of which it claims to be a violation of its
                rights, is Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá. The provisions of that arti-
                cle that are relevant to the question before us read as follows:
                             “[T]he High Contracting Parties declare that they recognize in rela-
                         tion to any other American State, the jurisdiction of the Court as
                         compulsory ipso facto, without the necessity of any special agreement
                         so long as the present Treaty is in force, in all disputes of a juridical
                         nature that arise among them concerning:
                         �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                         (c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute
                               the breach of an international obligation”.





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 241                                                                                                                        10/09/23 09:40

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)        385

                   6. It is understood that those provisions, which in substance reproduce
                those of Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, do not allow
                a State to institute contentious proceedings against another State after the
                date on which the treaty — the Pact of Bogotá — ceased to be in force
                between them, whether the “fact” alleged to “constitute the breach of an
                international obligation” itself occurred before or after that date. But that
                does not answer our question, since in this case Nicaragua instituted pro-
                ceedings the day before the treaty ceased to be in force between itself and
                Colombia.
                   7. In my view, it is hard to reconcile the aforementioned provisions,
                which circumscribe the consent given by Colombia to the Court’s juris-
                diction, with the idea that the Court is competent to examine the facts
                attributed to the Respondent and to decide whether they constitute a
                breach of an international obligation, when those facts occurred after the
                date on which Colombia ceased to be a party to the Pact of Bogotá and
                its consent to the jurisdiction of the Court thus came to an end.
                   That those facts were brought to the attention of the Court and sub-
                mitted for its examination as part of a case which was already pending,
                rather than through the institution of new proceedings by Nicaragua
                (which would obviously be impossible), does not appear to me to require
                a fundamentally different answer to the question of jurisdiction ratione
                temporis.
                   8. To justify the solution it adopts, the Court refers in paragraph 44 of
                the present Judgment to precedents which are, in my view, irrelevant.

                   Most of them concern the question of whether and to what extent a
                party can file a new claim in the course of proceedings. The Court has
                found such an additional claim to be possible, on condition that either it
                is implicit in the application instituting proceedings or it arises directly
                out of the question which is the subject-­         matter of the application
                (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the
                Congo), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (II), p. 657, para. 41,
                referring to Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Pre‑
                liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992).
                   Yet this line of jurisprudence, which must be considered well estab-
                lished, is irrelevant in the present case, for several reasons.
                   First, it does not concern the jurisdiction of the Court, but is intended
                to settle what is purely a question of admissibility: that is, whether an
                applicant can add a claim during proceedings or whether they must file
                that claim in the form of a new application instituting proceedings instead.
                In all those precedents, the title of jurisdiction had not lapsed. That is
                why that jurisprudence applies irrespective of whether the new claim
                relates to facts which occurred before the application was made (as hap-
                pened in the Diallo case) or afterwards. The date of the facts is imma­
                terial, since the title of jurisdiction continues to exist.
                   There is no doubt, in my view, that the Court should have referred to
                that jurisprudence, and that it would have been entirely relevant, had





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 243                                                                          10/09/23 09:40

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)          386

                Nicaragua introduced in the course of the proceedings, after the filing of
                the Application or even after the lapse of the jurisdictional title, one or
                more new claims relating to actions carried out by Colombia before
                27 November 2013. Yet that is not the question which arises in this case.

                  Furthermore, the relatively flexible approach adopted by the Court in
                the context of the jurisprudence cited above (whose flexibility is not
                boundless, however: in the Diallo case, the new claim was declared inad-
                missible) can easily be explained by a desire to avoid excessive formalism
                and concerns of procedural economy and efficiency.

                   Such considerations have no role to play in the present case, since the
                question put to the Court is of an entirely different nature: the question
                pertains to the Court’s jurisdiction — which calls for a degree of rigour —
                and not to the conduct of proceedings — which would justify a degree of
                flexibility.
                   9. The Judgment also refers to the Djibouti v. France case, in which the
                Court explored whether it could adjudicate the claims made by the Appli-
                cant in the course of the proceedings from the standpoint of jurisdiction
                rather than admissibility. However, the question arose in very particular
                circumstances, since the Court’s jurisdiction was founded on the consent
                given by the Respondent after the filing of the Application, under Arti-
                cle 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court, and it was a matter of inter-
                preting the terms and determining the scope of that consent.

                   Since France had given its consent “for the dispute forming the subject
                of the Application”, the Court had to establish what that wording cov-
                ered, and it is not surprising that, to do so, it referred to its jurisprudence
                on new claims (Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Mat‑
                ters (Djibouti v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, pp. 211‑212,
                paras. 87-88). However, the title of jurisdiction had not lapsed, and the
                question that the Court had to decide was one of jurisdiction ratione
                materiae, not jurisdiction ratione temporis. In my opinion, no conclusion
                can be drawn from that Judgment that is of relevance to the question
                before the Court in the present case.
                   10. In short, I fail to see any convincing argument for extending the
                Court’s jurisdiction to cover facts occurring after 27 November 2013. I
                would certainly have no difficulty in accepting that account must be taken
                of facts or conduct that occurred after the date on which the jurisdictional
                title lapsed, if there were a link between those facts and the ones occurring
                before that date, causing them to form an indivisible whole. In such a case,
                it would only be possible to assess the scope of the facts occurring before
                the critical date, and to judge their lawfulness, by taking into consider-
                ation certain later developments from which they were indissociable.
                   Yet nothing of the sort applies in the present case. The facts alleged by
                Nicaragua to have occurred after 27 November 2013 are entirely disso-
                ciable from the earlier facts (because to my mind it does not suffice for





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 245                                                                            10/09/23 09:40

                them to be more or less of the same nature), and each of them requires
                separate examination, which is what the Judgment undertakes.
                   11. It is for the above reasons that I have had to vote against subpara-

                           II. The Question of the “Integral Contiguous Zone”

                   13. I also disagree with the way in which the Judgment addresses the
                question of the “integral contiguous zone” established by Colombia’s
                Decree 1946 of 9 September 2013.
                   14. In brief, the Court carried out an abstract examination of whether
                the Decree at issue (or the contiguous zone as provided for by the Decree,
                which amounts to the same thing) complies with “international law”. To
                that end, the Judgment begins by defining the content of the customary
                international law applicable to the creation of contiguous zones by States
                (paragraphs 147 to 155); it then examines Decree 1946 in order to identify
                which of its provisions are incompatible with international law (para-
                graphs 164 to 187), before considering whether, by its very promulgation,
                the Decree — several provisions of which the Court has already found to
                be contrary to the applicable law — could engage Colombia’s interna-
                tional responsibility (paragraphs 188 to 194). That leads the Court
                towards an operative clause in which, first, it finds that the contiguous
                zone “is not in conformity with customary international law” (subpara-
                graph 5 of the operative clause) and, secondly, it rules that Colombia
                must bring the Decree into conformity with that law (subparagraph 6).
                   15. To my mind, this is too abstract an approach to the issue, which
                does not correspond to the examination that the Court was called upon
                to carry out in this case. Nicaragua’s complaint was that, by creating this
                “integral contiguous zone”, Colombia had violated the rights of
                the ­Applicant in the maritime areas adjudged by the 2012 Judgment to
                appertain to the latter, inasmuch as that Judgment fixed the maritime
                boundary separating the exclusive economic zones of Nicaragua and
                Colombia. Rather than examining in abstracto whether Decree 1946 (or the
                contiguous zone established by it, which amounts to the same thing) was in
                conformity with international law, the Court should have asked whether

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)          388

                and to what extent the contiguous zone violated — or was capable of
                violating, when the Decree was implemented — the rights claimed by
                Nicaragua, the rights that the Applicant alleged Colombia failed to
                ­
                respect, in breach of the 2012 Judgment. Such an approach — the only
                correct one, in my view — would not have led the Court to the same
                ­conclusions.
                   16. As a general rule, when a State comes before the Court to invoke
                 the international responsibility of another State, it is not acting in defence
                 of international law but to protect its own rights which, in its view, have
                 been violated by the respondent as a result of the latter’s failure to com-
                 ply with an obligation owed to the applicant. The only exception is when
                 there are erga omnes or erga omnes partes obligations at issue: in such
                 cases, the applicant acts to ensure protection of the collective interest
                 which those obligations are specifically intended to guarantee.

                    17. It may happen, and often happens, that the question of whether a
                given act of the respondent is in conformity with international law and
                the question of whether that same act respects the applicant’s rights coin-
                cide in practice, even if they remain distinct in theory. Thus, in this case,
                if Nicaragua’s Decree of 27 August 2013 establishing a system of straight
                baselines to measure the breadth of the territorial sea is contrary to
                ­international law (as the Judgment finds, and I agree on this point), the
                 result must be a violation of Colombia’s rights, once it is accepted that
                 the latter is specially affected by the consequences of this wrongful act.
                 That is why I voted in favour of subparagraph 7 of the operative clause,
                 without dwelling on the wording, which, in my view, is not the most felic-
                 itous.
                    18. The situation is different as regards the question of whether Colom-
                 bia’s contiguous zone is in conformity with international law and that of
                 whether the rights invoked by Nicaragua have been respected, questions
                 which do not fully coincide.
                    19. Nicaragua did not ask the Court to conduct an abstract examina-
                 tion of Decree 1946 in the light of international law, but to find that the
                 Decree — and the contiguous zone defined therein —violated its rights in
                 its exclusive economic zone. Of course, in order to answer the question
                 thus submitted to it, the Court had to address the issue of the applicable
                 law and examine — to some extent — whether the provisions of
                 Decree 1946 were compatible with that law. But it should not have lost
                 sight — which, in my opinion, it tended to do — of the fact that such an
                 examination was only relevant in so far as it enabled the Court to decide
                 whether Nicaragua’s rights had been violated, rather than whether
                 Colombia had complied with international law as such.

                  20. The rights alleged by Nicaragua to have been violated are those
                which the Applicant, as a coastal State, can claim in its exclusive eco-
                nomic zone. Those rights are not a direct result of the 2012 Judgment but
                are derived from it, since that Judgment fixed the limits of the exclusive





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 249                                                                            10/09/23 09:40

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)      389

                economic zone. In short, Nicaragua alleged that Colombia failed to
                respect the maritime boundary as drawn by the Court in 2012, by seeking
                to exercise, on Nicaragua’s side of the boundary, powers incompatible
                with the rights belonging to the Applicant in its exclusive economic zone.
                The rights in question are the “sovereign rights” and “jurisdiction” con-
                ferred on the coastal State in its exclusive economic zone by Article 56 of
                the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter
                “UNCLOS”), which reflects customary international law; they are enu-
                merated in Article 56, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), of that Convention. Note
                that Nicaragua did not include among the rights whose violation it alleged
                before the Court its right of freedom of navigation, which it (together
                with third States) unquestionably possesses in its exclusive economic
                zone, but which was in no way affected, either in its scope or in its exis-
                tence, by the maritime boundary fixed by the 2012 Judgment.

                   In my view, it is thus the provisions of Article 56, paragraph 1 (a) and
                (b), of UNCLOS which should have served as a reference point for the
                Court’s examination of Decree 1946, rather than the provisions of Arti-
                cle 33, paragraph 1, of the same Convention, which defines the powers
                that the coastal State may exercise in its contiguous zone.
                   21. I am therefore of the opinion that the Court should have addressed
                two questions. It should first have considered whether the provisions of
                Decree 1946 violate — or are capable of violating — the sovereign rights
                and jurisdiction of Nicaragua in its exclusive economic zone, as defined
                by Article 56, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), of UNCLOS. If the answer to
                that question were in the affirmative, or partially in the affirmative, the
                Court should then have considered whether, by its mere existence, the
                Decree at issue constituted an internationally wrongful act engaging
                Colombia’s international responsibility.
                   22. As regards the first question, I note that the Judgment deals at
                quite considerable length with a point which, under my approach, is of
                rather limited relevance, namely the breadth of the contiguous zone. Hav-
                ing found that the rule set out in Article 33, paragraph 2, of UNCLOS —
                which states that the breadth of the contiguous zone may not exceed
                24 nautical miles — reflected customary law, the Court declares that
                Decree 1946 fails to comply with the applicable law because it extends the
                contiguous zone that it establishes beyond 24 nautical miles in some
                areas. That may be so, but it is hardly relevant in the present case. There
                are two possibilities here: either the powers conferred on the Colombian
                authorities by Decree 1946 are compatible with the “sovereign rights”
                and “jurisdiction” of Nicaragua, as defined in Article 56, paragraph 1 (a)
                and (b), of UNCLOS, in which case the fact that the Colombian contigu-
                ous zone is wider than 24 nautical miles does not per se violate Nicara-
                gua’s rights in its exclusive economic zone; or, the powers in question are
                incompatible with Nicaragua’s rights, in which case there would have
                been a violation of those rights even if the limits of the contiguous zone
                had complied with the 24-nautical-mile rule, since, in any event, part of





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 251                                                                        10/09/23 09:40

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)         390

                the contiguous zone would inevitably overlap with Nicaragua’s exclusive
                economic zone. If there were a violation of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights
                and jurisdiction, the fact that the Colombian contiguous zone extends
                beyond 24 nautical miles could, at the very most, be considered an aggra-
                vating circumstance, since that violation would produce geographically
                more extensive effects.

                   23. The crucial question, in fact, is whether the powers which
                Decree 1946 confers on the Colombian authorities are incompatible with
                the “sovereign rights” and “jurisdiction” of Nicaragua, as a coastal State,
                in its exclusive economic zone.
                   24. In this regard, the Court identifies several provisions in the Decree
                which it deems to go beyond the powers that international law — namely
                Article 33, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS, inasmuch as it reflects customary
                law — allows a State to exercise in its contiguous zone. This is the case
                for the provisions of Article 5 of the Decree which cover the prevention
                of infringements and control over compliance with laws and regulations
                regarding the “security of the State, including piracy, trafficking of drugs
                and psychotropic substances, as well as conduct contrary to the security
                in the sea”. It is also the case for the provision covering “the preservation
                of the maritime environment”.
                   25. As regards the first category of provisions, it is quite possible that
                “[t]he inclusion of security in the material scope of Colombia’s powers
                within the ‘integral contiguous zone’ is . . . not in conformity with the
                relevant customary rule”, as the Court states in paragraph 177, and that
                the Decree is therefore contrary to international law in this respect. But,
                as I explained earlier, that was not the question submitted to the Court.
                The question was whether the powers conferred on the Colombian
                authorities by the Decree violated the “sovereign rights” and “jurisdic-
                tion” of Nicaragua in its exclusive economic zone. No evidence has been
                provided to show that this is the case as far as the provisions of the Decree
                relating to security are concerned; doing so would involve identifying the
                provisions of Article 56, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), which had been — or
                might be — violated by the provisions so criticized.

                   26. As for the provision in the Decree referring to “the preservation of
                the maritime environment”, I fully accept that it raises a serious difficulty
                in respect of the “sovereign rights” and “jurisdiction” of Nicaragua in its
                exclusive economic zone. Customary law does indeed grant the State to
                which the exclusive economic zone belongs “jurisdiction . . . with regard
                to . . . the protection and preservation of the marine environment” (Arti-
                cle 56, paragraph 1 (b) (iii), reflecting customary law). That jurisdiction
                is exclusive as regards the adoption of laws and regulations pertaining to
                the conservation of biological resources and preservation of the marine
                environment. However, when it comes to the application of those laws
                and regulations, the jurisdiction of the coastal State is not exclusive: third
                States thus have the power to take the necessary measures to ensure that





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 253                                                                           10/09/23 09:40

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)         391

                vessels flying their flag comply with the laws and regulations enacted by
                the coastal State, as mentioned in the Judgment (paragraph 179, referring
                to an Advisory Opinion of the International Tribunal for the Law of the
                Sea: Request for an Advisory Opinion submitted by the Sub‑Regional Fish‑
                eries Commission, Advisory Opinion, 2 April 2015, ITLOS Reports 2015,
                p. 37, para. 120). Consequently, there would be a violation of Nicara-
                gua’s jurisdiction if that particular provision of Article 5 of Decree 1946
                was applied in such a way as to empower the Colombian authorities to
                enact rules on the “preservation of the maritime environment” in the part
                of the contiguous zone overlapping with Nicaragua’s exclusive economic
                zone, or to exercise measures of constraint against vessels flying the flag
                of a third State.

                    27. It remains to be determined whether by its mere existence — that is
                to say, in the absence of any specific measure implementing the provision
                at issue — Decree 1946, inasmuch as it gives Colombia jurisdiction in
                relation to the “preservation of the maritime environment”, engages
                Colombia’s responsibility v­ is-à-vis Nicaragua.
                    28. I do not think it necessary to adopt a position on the general ques-
                tion of whether a State engages its international responsibility simply by
                adopting national legislation, a question in respect of which the Interna-
                tional Law Commission rightly stated that there was no general and
                unequivocal answer.
                    It seems to me that, at the very least, for a law or regulation, by its
                mere adoption or its mere promulgation, to constitute an internationally
                wrongful act, one condition must be met, which is necessary but may not
                be sufficient. The condition is that the law or regulation, by virtue of
                its content, is such that its application cannot fail to lead to the violation
                of an international obligation. If the text in question is open to a number
                of interpretations, one or more of which would be compatible with
                the State’s international obligations, I find it hard to regard it as
                ­constituting a wrongful act per se, even before its practical implementa-
                 tion brings to light a violation of an international obligation, if such
                 there be.
                    29. I am not convinced that the above condition is met in the present
                 case. It would be possible for Decree 1946 to be interpreted by the Colom-
                 bian authorities (if need be, by the judicial authorities) in a restrictive
                 fashion, precluding the provision referring to “the preservation of the
                 maritime environment” from being implemented in such a way as to
                 allow Colombia to exercise legislative power in Nicaragua’s exclusive eco-
                 nomic zone. This is even more apparent in respect of the provision of the
                 Decree referring to the protection of “national maritime interests”, which,
                 the Court notes, “through its broad wording alone, appears to encroach
                 on the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Nicaragua as set forth in Arti-
                 cle 56, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS” (para. 178). It too could be interpreted
                 in a restrictive fashion so as to render it compatible with Nicaragua’s
                 rights.

                         sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. abraham)         392

                   30. The important point, to my mind, is not whether such an interpre-
                tation reflects the intentions of the Decree’s drafters (which is highly
                debatable). Nor am I unduly influenced by the presence in Article 5 of the
                Decree of the clause added in 2014, according to which “[t]he Application
                of this article will be carried out in conformity with international law”. A
                State is always bound to apply its legislation in conformity with interna-
                tional law in so far as this is possible and, if it is not, to amend it. The
                aforementioned clause therefore adds nothing, in terms of the interna-
                tional obligations of the State. The decisive point is that if, in its Judg-
                ment, the Court had provided guidance on how the provisions of
                Decree 1946 should be applied (and the limits within which they may be
                applied) in order to ensure the compatibility of the contiguous zone with
                Nicaragua’s rights, Colombia would have been obliged to comply with
                that guidance when implementing the Decree. That is how, in my opin-
                ion, the Court should have proceeded, rather than finding the contiguous
                zone contrary to international law and ordering Colombia to bring the
                Decree into conformity with that law, which requires it to be amended.
                   31. For the foregoing reasons, I have been compelled to vote against
                subparagraphs 5 and 6 of the operative clause. This does not mean that I
                consider that Colombia’s “integral contiguous zone” does not give rise to
                serious difficulties in respect of Nicaragua’s rights. But I address the ques-
                tion from a different perspective than that chosen by most of my col-
                leagues, and I regret that I cannot reach the same conclusions as they do.
