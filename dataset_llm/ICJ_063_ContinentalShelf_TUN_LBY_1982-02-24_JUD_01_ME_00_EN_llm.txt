Mr. Henri-Xavier Ortoli,

as Counsel.


composed as above,
after deliberation,

delivers the following Judgment:




24. The Court is thus authorized by the Special Agreement to take into
account “new accepted trends” which can be considered, as the term

has run considerably further to the east than the area relevant to the
delimitation (see further paragraph 75 below). Nor does any geographical
evidence as to the direction of any “natural prolongation” assist in deter-
mining the boundaries thereof, however relevant it may be as a circum-

above), that is to say, the perpendicular to the coast. The 26° line therefore
reflects all appropriate factors; as the line extends further seawards,
however, certain other relevant factors come into play, and it is to con-
sideration of such factors, and of their effect in determining how far the
26° line should extend, and what should be the method of delimitation

of smail inlets, creeks and lagoons, is approximately 185 kilometres ; the
length of the coast of Tunisia from Ras Ajdir to Ras Kaboudia, measured
in a similar way, and treating the island of Jerba as though it were a
promontory, is approximately 420 kilometres. Thus the relevant coastline
of Libya stands in the proportion of approximately 31:69 to the relevant

(1) the delimitation is to be effected in accordance with equitable princi-
ples, and taking account of all relevant circumstances ;

(2) the area relevant for the delimitation constitutes a single continental
shelf as the natural prolongation of the land territory of both Parties,
so that in the present case, no criterion for delimitation of shelf areas
can be derived from the principle of natural prolongation as such ;

(3) in the particular geographical circumstances of the present case, the

physical structure of the continental shelf areas is not such as to de-
termine an equitable line of delimitation.



B. The relevant circumstances referred to in paragraph A, subpara-
graph (1), above, to be taken into account in achieving an equitable.
delimitation include the following :

(1) the fact that the area relevant to the delimitation in the present case is
bounded by the Tunisian coast from Ras Ajdir to Ras Kaboudia and
the Libyan coast from Ras Ajdir to Ras Tajoura and by the parallel of
latitude passing through Ras Kaboudia and the meridian passing
through Ras Tajoura, the rights of third States being reserved ;

(2) the general configuration of the coasts of the Parties, and in particular
the marked change in direction of the Tunisian coastline between Ras
Ajdir and Ras Kaboudia ;

(3) the existence and position of the Kerkennah Islands ;

(4) the land frontier between the Parties, and their conduct prior to 1974 in
the grant of petroleum concessions, resulting in the employment of a
line seawards from Ras Ajdir at an angle of approximately 26° east of
the meridian, which line corresponds to the line perpendicular to the
coast at the frontier point which had in the past been observed as a de
facto maritime limit ;

(5) the element of a reasonable degree of proportionality, which a delimi-
tation carried out in accordance with equitable principles ought to
bring about between the extent of the continental shelf areas apper-
taining to the coastal State and the length of the relevant part of its
coast, measured in the general direction of the coastlines, account
being taken for this purpose of the effects, actual or prospective, of any
other continental shelf delimitation between States in the same region.

C. The practical method for the application of the aforesaid principles
and rules of international law in the particular situation of the present case
is the following :

(1) the taking into account of the relevant circumstances which charac-
terize the area defined in paragraph B, subparagraph (1), above,
including its extent, calls for it to be treated, for the purpose of its
delimitation between the Parties to the present case, as made up of two
sectors, each requiring the application of a specific method of delimi-
tation in order to achieve an overall equitable solution ;

(2) in the first sector, namely in the sector closer to the coast of the Parties,
the starting point for the line of delimitation is the point where the
outer limit of the territorial sea of the Parties is intersected by a straight
line drawn from the land frontier point of Ras Ajdir through the point
33° 55’ N, 12° E, which line runs at a bearing of approximately 26° east
of north, corresponding to the angle followed by the north-western
boundary of Libyan petroleum concessions numbers NC 76, 137,
NC 41 and NC 53, which was aligned on the south-eastern boundary
of Tunisian petroleum concession “Permis complémentaire offshore
du Golfe de Gabès” (21 October 1966) ; from the intersection point so
determined, the line of delimitation between the two continental




shelves is to run north-east through the point 33° 55’ N, 12° E, thus on
that same bearing, to the point of intersection with the parallel passing
through the most westerly point of the Tunisian coastline between Ras
Kaboudia and Ras Ajdir, that is to say, the most westerly point on the
shoreline (low-water mark) of the Gulf of Gabes ;

(3) in the second sector, namely in the area which extends seawards

beyond the parallel of the most westerly point of the Gulf of Gabes, the
line of delimitation of the two continental shelves is to veer to the east
in such a way as to take account of the Kerkennah Islands ; that is to
say, the delimitation line is to run parallel to a line drawn from the
most westerly point of the Gulf of Gabes bisecting the angle formed by
a line from that point to Ras Kaboudia and a line drawn from that
same point along the seaward coast of the Kerkennah Islands, the
bearing of the delimitation line parallel to such bisector being 52° to
the meridian ; the extension of this line northeastwards is a matter
falling outside the jurisdiction of the Court in the present case, as it
will depend on the delimitation to be agreed with third States.
