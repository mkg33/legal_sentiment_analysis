with particular circumspection and has taken special care, being faced
with the absence of the respondent State.

19. Accordingly, for the purposes of Article 53 of the Statute, and
subject to the matters mentioned in paragraphs 71 to 76 below, the Court
considers that it has before it the elements necessary to enable it to



determine whether the Applicant’s claim is, or is not, well founded in

against these Regulations, which came into effect on 15 May 1952, was
made by the Federal Republic of Germany.

23. In 1958, as a result of the discussion by the United Nations General
Assembly of the Report of the International Law Commission on the
Law of the Sea, the First United Nations Conference on the Law of the
Sea was convened at Geneva. This Conference however failed to reach
agreement either on the limit of the territorial sea or on the zone of
exclusive fisheries; it adopted a resolution requesting the General Assem-
bly to study the advisability of convening a second Law of the Sea Con-
ference specifically to deal with these questions. After the conclusion of
the 1958 Conference, Iceland made on 1 June 1958 a preliminary an-
nouncement of its intention to reserve the right of fishing within an area
of 12 miles from the baselines exclusively to Icelandic fishermen, and to
extend the fishing zone also by modification of the baselines, and then
on 30 June 1958 issued new “Regulations concerning the Fisheries
Limits off Iceland”. Article 1 of these proclaimed a new 12-mile fishery
limit around Iceland drawn from new baselines defined in that Article,
and Article 2 prohibited all fishing activities by foreign vessels within the
new fishery limit. Article 7 of the Regulations expressly stated that they
were promulgated in accordance with the Law of 1948 concerning Scien-
tific Conservation of the Continental Shelf Fisheries.

24. The Federal Republic of Germany did not accept the validity of
the new Regulations, and made its position known to the Government of
Iceland by a note-verbale dated 9 June 1958. However, it issued a
recommendation to the German Trawler Owners’ Association that
fishing vessels should abstain from fishing inside the 12-mile limit, in order
to prevent incidents occurring on the fishing grounds, and this recom-



mendation was in fact followed by the vessels of the Federal Republic.
Various attempts were made to settle the dispute by negotiation but the
dispute remained unresolved. On 5 May 1959 the Althing passed a
Resolution on the matter in which, inter alia, it said:

... the Althing declares that it considers that Iceland has an
indisputable right to a 12-mile fishery limit, that a recognition
should be obtained of Iceland’s right to the entire continental shelf
area in conformity with the policy adopted by the Law of 1948, con-
cerning the Scientific Conservation of the Continental Shelf Fisheries
and that fishery limits of less than 12 miles from base-lines around
the country are out of the question” (emphasis added).

The Resolution thus stressed that the 12-mile limit asserted in the 1958
Regulations was merely a further step in Iceland’s progress towards its
objective of a fishery zone extending over the whole of the continental
shelf area.

25. In the same year, the Federal Republic of Germany and Iceland
embarked on a series of negotiations with a view to the settlement of
their dispute regarding the 1958 Regulations. These negotiations were
preceded by a Note from the Government of Iceland of 5 August 1959 in
which, after explaining in some detail the position it had taken at the
1958 Conference on the Law of the Sea, it stated that it would greatly
appreciate it “if the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany
would consider the special situation and wishes of Iceland”. The Ice-
landic Government added that “where a nation is overwhelmingly
dependent upon fisheries it should be lawful to take special measures, and
decide a further extension of the fishing zone for meeting the needs of
such a nation”. The Note referred to the Resolution adopted at the 1958
Conference on Special Situations relating to Coastal Fisheries. In its
reply of 7 October 1959 the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany pointed out that it was prepared to recognize the special
dependence of Iceland on its fisheries, but could not accept the view that
the coastal State had a right to include an adjacent area in its fishing zone
unilaterally. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany
pointed out that the 1958 Resolution would not justify unilateral Ice-
landic measures since it merely provided for the elaboration of agreed
measures, and explicitly laid down that consideration must be given to
the interests of other States. The negotiations came to a halt pending the
Second United Nations Conference on the|Law of the Sea in 1960, and
did not re-open thereafter. On 13 March 1961, the Government of Iceland
notified the Federal Republic of the conclusion of an Exchange of Notes
with the United Kingdom settling the dispute with that country re-
garding the 12-mile fishery limits and baselines claimed by Iceland in
its 1958 Regulations. Thereupon further negotiations were commenced,
and on 19 July 1961 an agreement in the form of an Exchange of



Notes was concluded for the settlement of the dispute.

26. The substantive provisions of the settlement, which were set out
in the principal Note addressed by the Government of Iceland to the
Government of the Federal Republic, were as follows:

(1) The Federal Republic would no longer object to a 12-mile fishery zone
around Iceland measured from the baselines accepted solely for the
purpose of the delimitation of that zone.

(2) The Federal Republic accepted for that purpose the baselines set out
in the 1958 Regulations subject to the modification of four specified
points.

(3) For a period expiring on 10 March 1964, Iceland would not object to
fishing by vessels of the Federal Republic within certain specified
areas and during certain stated months of the year.

(4) During the same period, however, vessels of the Federal Republic
would not fish within the outer 6 miles of the 12-mile zone in seven
specified areas.

(5) Iceland would “continue to work for the implementation of the
Althing Resolution of 5 May 1959, regarding the extension of the
fishery jurisdiction of Iceland. However it shall give the Government
of the Federal Republic of Germany six months’ notice of any such
extension; in case of a dispute relating to such an extension, the
matter shall, at the request of either Party, be referred to the Inter-
national Court of Justice”.

In its Note in reply the Federal Republic of Germany emphasized that,
being “mindful of the exceptional importance of coastal fisheries to the
Icelandic economy”, it “agrees to the arrangement set forth in your note,
and that your note and this reply thereto constitute an agreement
between our two Governments which shall enter into force immediately,
subject to the stipulation by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany that this agreement is without prejudice to its rights under
international law towards third States”.

27. On 14 July 1971 the Government of Iceland issued a policy state-
ment in which, inter alia, it was said :

“That the agreements on fisheries jurisdiction with the British
and the West Germans be terminated and that a decision be taken
on the extension of fisheries jurisdiction to 50 nautical miles from
base-lines, and that this extension become effective not later than
September 1st, 1972.”

This led the Government of the Federal Republic, during talks in Bonn
in August 1971, to remind the Government of Iceland of the terms of the
1961 Exchange of Notes, and to express the view that the Icelandic



fisheries zone could not be extended unilaterally, that the Exchange of
Notes was not open to unilateral denunciation or termination, and to
state that the Government of the Federal Republic would have to reserve
their rights thereunder. No agreement was reached during these talks, and
in an aide-mémoire of 31 August 1971 Iceland stated that it considered
the object and purpose of the provision for recourse to judicial settlement
to have been fully achieved; and that it now found it essential to extend
further the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around its coasts to
include the areas of the sea covering the continental shelf. Iceland further
added that the new limits, the precise boundaries of which would be
furnished at a later date, would enter into force not later than 1 Sep-
tember 1972; and that it was prepared to hold further meetings “for the
purpose of achieving a practical solution of the problems involved”.

28. The Federal Republic replied on 27 September 1971 and reaffirmed
its view that “the unilateral assumption of sovereign power by a coastal
State over zones of the high seas is inadmissible under international law”.
It then controverted Iceland’s proposition that the object and purpose
of the provision for recourse to judicial settlement of disputes relating to
an extension of fisheries jurisdiction had been fully achieved, and again
reserved all its rights under that provision. At the same time, however,
the Federal Republic expressed its willingness, without prejudice to its
legal position, to enter into further exploratory discussions. In November
1971 the Federal Republic and Iceland held discussions in which the
Federal Republic of Germany expressed its understanding for the concern
of the Government of Iceland about the possibility of injury to fish stocks
in the area in question if fishing remained unregulated, and therefore
proposed practical measures to meet the Icelandic concern. In their
proposal the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany expressed
the conviction that, taking into account the special situation of Iceland
as far as fisheries are concerned, it should be possible, within the frame-
work of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, to come to an
arrangement whereby all nations engaged in fishing around Iceland would
limit their catches. The Federal Republic of Germany further made the
offer that pending the elaboration of a muitilateral arrangement within
the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission the total catch of demersal
species by vessels of the Federal Republic of Germany would be limited
to the average taken by such vessels during the years 1960 to 1969. These
proposals did not lead to any result, and the negotiations which took
place in February 1972 also failed to resolve the dispute.

29. On 15 February 1972 the Althing adopted a Resolution reitera-
ting the fundamental policy of the Icelandic people that the continental
shelf of Iceland and the superjacent waters were within the jurisdiction
of Iceland. While reiterating that the Exchange of Notes of 1961 no


longer constituted an obligation for Iceland, it resolved, inter alia:

“1, That the fishery limits will be extended to 50 miles from baselines
around the country, to become effective not later than 1 Sep-
tember 1972.

the extension be continued through discussions with the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of
Germany.

4. That effective supervision of the fish stocks in the Iceland area be
continued in consultation with marine biologists and that the
necessary measures be taken for the protection of the fish stocks
and specified areas in order to prevent over-fishing . . .”

In an aide-mémoire of 24 February 1972 Iceland’s Minister for Foreign
Affairs formally notified the Ambassador of the Federal Republic in
Reykjavik of his Government’s intention to proceed in accordance with
this Resolution.

30. On 4 March 1972 the Ambassador of the Federal Republic in-
formed the Prime Minister of Iceland of his Government’s decision to
bring the question before the Court. On 14 March 1972, the Federal
Republic in an aide-mémoire formally took note of the decision of Iceland
to issue new Regulations, and reaffirmed its position that ‘a unilateral
extension of the fishery zone of Iceland to 50 miles is incompatible with
the general rules of international law”, and that ‘‘the Exchange of Notes
of 1961 continues to be in force and cannot be denounced unilaterally”.
Moreover, formal notice was also given by the Federal Republic that it
would submit the dispute to the Court in accordance with the Exchange
of Notes; the Government of the Federal Republic was however willing
to continue discussions with Iceland “in order to agree upon satisfactory
practical arrangements at least for the period while the case is before the
International Court of Justice”. On 5 June 1972, the Federal Republic
of Germany filed in the Registry its Application bringing the present case
before the Court.

31. A series of negotiations between representatives of the two coun-
tries soon followed and continued throughout May, June and July 1972,
at which various proposals for catch-limitation, fishing-effort limitation,
area or seasonal restrictions for vessels of the Federal Republic were
discussed, in the hope of arriving at practical arrangements for an interim
régime pending the settlement of the dispute. At the meeting of 15 May,
the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany explained his
Government’s concept of an interim arrangement on the basis of limiting
the annual catches of fishing vessels from the Federal Republic of Ger-
many to the average of the years 1960 to 1969. On 2 June 1972 the Ice-
landic Foreign Minister presented counter-proposals for an interim



agreement. In presenting these the Icelandic Foreign Minister, according
to the Applicant, stated:

“The British and German proposals for catch limitation and the
closure of certain areas for all trawling (Icelandic and foreign)
although they are helpful as far as they go, do not take the basic
principle of preferential treatment sufficiently into account because
if you continue to fish up to the 12-mile limit more or less as you
have done, our preferential position is not recognized. It would
rather mean the freezing of the status-quo ... What we are really
talking about is the reduction of your fishing in Icelandic waters in a
tangible, visible manner.”

Thus, while Iceland invoked preferential rights and the Applicant was
prepared to recognize them, basic differences remained as to the extent
and scope of those rights and as to the methods for their implementation
and their enforcement. There can be little doubt that these divergences of
views were some of the “problems connected with the extension” in
respect of which the Althing Resolution of 15 February 1972 had in-
structed the Icelandic Government to make “efforts to reach a solution”.
By 14 July there was still no agreement on an interim régime, and on that
date new Regulations were issued extending Iceland’s fishery limits to
50 miles as from 1 September 1972 and, by Article 2, prohibiting all
fishing activities by foreign vessels inside those limits. Consequently, on
21 July 1972, the Federal Republic filed in the Registry of the Court its
request for the indication of interim measures of protection.

32. On 17 August 1972 the Court made an Order for provisional
measures in which, inter alia, it indicated that, pending the Court’s final
decision in the proceedings, Iceland should refrain from taking any
measures to enforce the Regulations of 14 July 1972 against vessels
registered in the Federal Republic and engaging in fishing outside the
12-mile fishery zone; and that the Federal Republic should limit the
annual catch of its vessels in the “Sea Area of Iceland” to 119,000 tons.
That the Federal Republic has complied with the terms of the catch-
limitation measure indicated in the Court’s Order has not been questioned
or disputed. Iceland, on the other hand, notwithstanding the measures
indicated by the Court, began to enforce the new Regulations against
vessels of the Federal Republic soon after they came into effect on 1
September 1972. Negotiations for an interim arrangement were, however,
resumed between the two countries, and were carried on intermittently
during 1972 and 1973; but they have not led to any agreement.

, 33- By its Judgment of 2 February 1973, the Court found that it had
jurisdiction to entertain the Application and to deal with the merits of the
dispute. However, even after the handing down of that Judgment, Iceland



persisted in its efforts to enforce the 50-mile limit against vessels of the
Federal Republic and, as appears from the letter of 11 January 1974
addressed to the Court by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland,
mentioned above, it has continued to deny the Court’s competence to
entertain the dispute.

* *

34. The question has been raised whether the Court has jurisdiction to
pronounce upon certain matters referred to the Court in paragraph 3
of the Applicant’s final submissions (paragraphs 12-13 above) concerning
the taking of conservation measures on the basis of agreement between
the Parties, concluded either bilaterally or within a multilateral frame-
work, with due regard to the special dependence of Iceland on its fisheries
and to the traditional fisheries of the Federal Republic of Germany in the
waters concerned.

35. In its Judgment of 2 February 1973, pronouncing on the juris-
diction of the Court in the present case, the Court found “that it has juris-
diction to entertain the Application filed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Germany on 5 June 1972 and to deal with the merits
of the dispute” (I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 66, para. 46). The Application
which the Court found it had jurisdiction to entertain contained a sub-
mission under letter (b) (cf. paragraph 12 above) which raised the issue
of conservation measures. These questions, among others, had previously
been discussed in the negotiations between the Parties referred to in
paragraphs 27 to 31 above and were also extensively examined in the
pleadings and hearings on the merits.

36. The Order of the Court indicating interim measures of protection
(Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Interim
Protection Order of 17 August 1972, T.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 30) implied
that the case before the Court involved questions of fishery conservation
and of preferential fishing rights since, in indicating a catch-limitation
figure for the Applicant’s fishing, the Court stated that this measure was
based on ‘‘the exceptional importance of coastal fisheries to the Icelandic
economy” and on “the need for the conservation of fish stocks in the
Iceland area” (loc. cit., p. 34, paras. 24 and 25).

37. In its Judgment of 2 February 1973, pronouncing on its juris-
diction in the case, the Court, after taking into account the aforesaid
contentions of the Applicant concerning fishery conservation and pref-
erential rights, referred again to “the exceptional dependence of Iceland
on its fisheries and the principle of conservation of fish stocks” (Z.C.J.
Reports 1973, p. 65, para. 42). The judicial notice taken therein of the
recognition given by the Parties to the exceptional dependence of Iceland
on its fisheries and to the need of conservation of fish stocks in the area
clearly implies that such questions are before the Court.



38. The Order of the Court of 12 July 1973 on the continuance of in-

terim measures of protection referred again to catch-limitation figures
and also to the question of ‘‘related restrictions concerning areas closed
to fishing, number and type of vessels allowed and forms of control of
the agreed provisions” (I.C.J. Reports 1973, p. 314, para. 7). Thus the
Court took the view that those questions were within its competence. As
the Court stated in its Order of 17 August 1972, there must be a connec-
tion “under Article 61, paragraph 1, of the Rules between a request for
interim measures of protection and the original Application filed with
the Court” (I.C.J. Reports 1972, p. 33, para. 12).
* 39. As to the compromissory clause in the 1961 Exchange of Notes,
this gives the Court jurisdiction with respect to “a dispute relating to such
an extension”, i.e., “the extension of the fishery jurisdiction of Iceland”.
The present dispute was occasioned by Iceland’s unilateral extension of
its fisheries jurisdiction. However, it would be too narrow an interpreta-
tion of the compromissory clause to conclude that the Court’s juris-
diction is limited to giving an affirmative or negative answer to the


50. State practice on the subject of fisheries reveals an increasing and
widespread acceptance of the concept of preferential rights for coastal
States, particularly in favour of countries or territories in a situation of
special dependence on coastal fisheries. Both the 1958 Resolution and the
1960 joint amendment concerning preferential rights were approved by
a large majority of the Conferences, thus showing overwhelming support
for the idea that in certain special situations it was fair to recognize that
the coastal State had preferential fishing rights. After these Conferences,
the preferential rights of the coastal State were recognized in various
bilateral and multilateral international agreements. The Court’s attention
has been drawn to the practice in this regard of the North-West and North-
East Atlantic Fisheries Commissions, of which 19 maritime States
altogether, including both Parties, are members; its attention has also
been drawn to the Arrangement Relating to Fisheries in Waters Sur-
rounding the Faroe Islands, signed at Copenhagen on 18 December 1973
on behalf of the Governments of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom, and
to the Agreement on the Regulation of the Fishing of North-East Arctic
(Arcto-Norwegian) Cod, signed on 15 March 1974 on behalf of the
Governments of the United Kingdom, Norway and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. Both the aforesaid agreements, in allocating the
annual shares on the basis of the past performance of the parties in the
area, assign an additional share to the coastal State on the ground of its
preferential right in the fisheries in its adjacent waters. The Faroese
agreement takes expressly into account in its preamble “the exceptional
dependence of the Faroese economy on fisheries” and recognizes “that
the Faroe Islands should enjoy preference in waters surrounding the
Faroe Islands”.

51. There can be no doubt of the exceptional importance of coastal
fisheries to the Icelandic economy. That exceptional importance was
explicitly recognized by the Applicant in the Exchange of Notes of 19
July 1961, and the Court has also taken judicial notice of such recognition
by declaring that it is “necessary to bear in mind the exceptional impor-
tance of coastal fisheries to the Icelandic economy” (I.C.J. Reports 1972,
p. 34, para. 24).

52. The preferential rights of the coastal State come into play only at
the moment when an intensification in the exploitation of fishery resources
makes it imperative to introduce some system of catch-limitation and
sharing of those resources to preserve the fish stocks in the interests of
their rational and economic exploitation. This situation appears to have
been reached in the present case. In regard to two demersal species—cod
and haddock—the Applicant has shown itself aware of the need for a
catch-limitation, which has become indispensable in view of the establish-
ment of catch-limitations in other regions of the North Atlantic. With
respect to other species fished by vessels of the Federal Republic of



Germany—redfish and saithe—it has been recognized by the Applicant
that the setting up of a catch-limitation scheme for certain species also
requires the establishment of overall quotas for other species, in order to
prevent the fishing effort displaced from one stock being transferred to
other stocks. For this reason it is for instance provided in the aforesaid
Arrangement Relating to Fisheries in Waters Surrounding the Faroe
Islands (Art. II) that the annual catches of demersal species other than
cod and haddock shall not exceed by more than an agreed percentage the
highest figure achieved in the years 1968 to 1972.

*

53. The Icelandic regulations challenged before the Court have been
issued and applied by the Icelandic authorities as a claim to exclusive
rights thus going beyond the concept of preferential rights. Article 2 of
the Icelandic Regulations of 14 July 1972 states:

“Within the fishery limits all fishing activities by foreign vessels
shall be prohibited in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 33
of 19 June 1922, concerning fishing inside the Fishery Limits.”

Article 1 of the 1922 Law provides: “Only Icelandic citizens may engage
in fishing in the territorial waters of iceland, and only Icelandic boats or
ships may be used for such fishing.” The language of the relevant govern-
ment regulations indicates that their object is to establish an exclusive
fishery zone, in which all fishing by vessels registered in other States, in-
cluding the Federal Republic of Germany, would be prohibited. The
mode of implementation of the regulations, carried out by Icelandic
governmental authorities vis-à-vis fishing vessels of the Federal Republic,
despite the Court’s interim measures, confirms this interpretation.

54. The concept of preferential rights is not compatible with the
exclusion of all fishing activities of other States. À coastal State entitled
to preferential rights is not free, unilaterally and according to its own
uncontrolled discretion, to determine the extent of those rights. The

Judge DILLARD makes the following declaration:

I concur in the findings of the Court indicated in the first four subpara-
graphs of the dispositif. My reasons for concurrence are set out in my
separate opinion in the companion case of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland v. Iceland. I consider these reasons applicable
mutatis mutandis to the present case.

While I concurred in the finding in the fifth subparagraph that the Court
“is unable to accede to the fourth submission of the Federal Republic
of Germany”, I am impelled to add the following reservation !.

The Court has held, in paragraph 72, that it is competent to entertain
this particular submission. Although, for obvious reasons, the sub-
mission was not included in the Application filed on 5 June 1972 since
the acts of harassment and interference occurred thereafter, it was
included in the Memorial on the merits and in the final submissions. The
delay therefore should not be a bar. The Court’s construction of the
nature and scope of the Exchange of Notes of 1961, revealed in its
analysis of the other submissions, is clearly consistent with its finding
that the compromissory clause is broad enough to cover this submission
as well. In my view the conclusion that the Court is competent to entertain
it, is thus amply justified.

The Court, however, has interpreted this submission as one asking the
Court to adjudicate with definitive effect that Iceland is under an obli-
gation to pay full compensation for all the damages suffered by the
Applicant as a consequence of the acts of interference specified in the
proceedings (para. 74). In keeping with this interpretation it considers
the submission to fall outside its province under Article 53 of its Statute
since it considers there is insufficient evidence to satisfy itself that each
concrete claim is well founded in fact and law (para. 76). If the Court’s
interpretation of the submission were the only permissible one, I would
concur without reservation in its conclusion.

But, in my view, it is not the only permissible one and it may not be
the most desirable one. The Applicant both in its Memorial on the
merits and in the oral proceedings has stressed the point that it is not at
present submitting any claim for the payment of a certain amount of
money. The submission itself only requests that the Court should declare
that the acts of harassment and interference were unlawful and in
consequence Iceland, as a matter of principle, is under a duty to make
compensation. True the submission is couched in a form that is abstract
but the question is whether this should deter the Court from passing
upon it. I am not altogether persuaded that it is.

That Iceland’s acts of harassment and interference (indicated in con-
siderable detail in the proceedings) were unlawful hardly admits of doubt.

I All of the Applicant's submissions are set out in para. 12 of the Judgment and the
fourth submission is also set out in para. 71.



They were committed pendente lite despite the obligations assumed by
Iceland in the Exchange of Notes of 1961 which the Court had declared
to be a treaty in force. That their unlawful character engaged the
international responsibility of Iceland is also clear. In the Phosphates in
Morocco case (P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 74, p. 28) the Court linked the
creation of international responsibility with the existence of an “act being
attributable to the State and described as contrary to the treaty right of
another State”. It is hardly necessary to marshal authority for so
elementary a proposition. It follows that, in effect, the Court was merely
asked to indicate the unlawful character of the acts and to take note of
the consequential liability of Iceland to make reparation. It was not
asked to assess damages.

The Court recognized this point in paragraph 74 of the Judgment but
instead of stressing the limited nature of the submission it preferred to
attribute to it a more extensive character. As indicated above, its inter-
pretation led naturally to the conclusion that it could not accede to the
submission in the absence of detailed evidence bearing on each concrete
claim. While conceding the force of the Court’s reasoning, I would have
preferred the more restrictive interpretation.

I wish to add that on this matter L associate myself with the views
expressed by Judge Sir Humphrey Waldock in his separate opinion.

Judge IGNACIO-PINTO makes the following declaration:

To my regret, I have been obliged to vote against the Court’s Judgment.
However, to my mind my negative vote does not, strictly speaking, signify
opposition, since in a different context I would certainly have voted in
favour of the process which the Court considered it should follow to
arrive at its decision. In my view that decision is devoted to fixing the
conditions for exercise of preferential rights, for conservation of fish
species, and historic rights, rather than to responding to the primary claim
of the Appiicant, which is for a statement of the law on a specific point.

I would have all the more willingly endorsed the concept of preferential
rights inasmuch as the Court has merely followed its own decision in the
Fisheries case.

It should be observed that the Applicant has nowhere sought a decision
from the Court on a dispute between itself and Iceland on the subject of
the preferential rights of the coastal State, the conservation of fish
species, or historic rights—this is apparent throughout the elaborate
reasoning of the Judgment. It is obvious that considerations relating to
these various needs, dealt with at length in the Judgment, are not subject
to any dispute between the Parties. There is no doubt that, after setting



out the facts and the grounds relied on in support of its case, the Applicant
has asked the Court only for a decision on the dispute between itself and
Iceland, and to adjudge and declare:

“That the unilateral extension by Iceland of its zone of exclusive
fisheries jurisdiction to 50 nautical miles from the present baselines,
... has, as against the Federal Republic of Germany, no basis in
international law . . .”” (Judgment, para. 12 (1)).

This is clear and precise, and all the other points in the submissions
are only ancillary or consequential to this primary claim. But in response
to this basic claim, which was extensively argued by the Applicant both
in its Memorial and orally, and which was retained in its final sub-
missions, the Court, by means of a line of reasoning which it has
endeavoured at some length to justify, has finally failed to give any
positive answer.

The Court has deliberately evaded the question which was placed
squarely before it in this case, namely whether Iceland’s claims are in
accordance with the rules of international law. Having put this question
on one side, it constructs a whole system of reasoning in order ultimately
to declare that the Regulations issued by the Government of Iceland
on 14 July 1972 and ‘‘constituting a unilateral extension of the exclusive
fishing rights of Iceland to 50 nautical miles from the baselines specified
therein are not opposable to the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany”.

In my view, the whole problem turns on this, since this claim is based
upon facts which, at least under present-day law and in the practice of
the majority of States, are flagrant violations of existing international
conventions. It should be noted that Iceland does not deny them. Now
the facts complained of are evident, they undoubtedly relate to the
treaty which binds the States which are Parties, for the Exchange of Notes
of 19 July 1961 amounts to such an instrument. For the Court to consider
after having dealt with the Applicant’s fundamental claim in relation to
international law, that account should be taken of Iceland’s exceptional
situation and the vital interests of its population, with a view to drawing
inspiration from equity and to devising a solution for the dispute, would
have been the normal course to be followed, the more so since the Appli-
cant supports it in its final submissions. But it cannot be admitted that
because of its special situation Iceland can ipso facto be exempted from
the obligation to respect the international commitments into which it has
entered. By not giving an unequivocal answer on that principal claim, the
Court has failed to perform the act of justice requested of it.

For what is one to say of the actions and behaviour of Iceland which
have resulted in its being called upon to appear before the Court? Its
refusal to respect the commitment it accepted in the Exchange of Notes of
19 July 1961, to refer to the International Court of Justice any dispute
which might arise on an extension of its exclusive fisheries zone, which



was in fact foreseen by the Parties, beyond 12 nautical miles, is not this
unjustified refusal a breach of international law?

In the same way, when—contrary to what is generally recognized by
the majority of States in the 1958 Geneva Convention, in Article 2, where
it is clearly specified that there is a zone of high seas which is res com-
munis—Iceland unilaterally decides, by means of its Regulations of 14
July 1972, to extend its exclusive jurisdiction from 12 to 50 nautical miles
from the baselines, does it not in this way also commit a breach of inter-
national law? Thus the Court would in no way be open to criticism if it
upheld the claim as well founded.

For my part, I believe that the Court would certainly have strengthened
its judicial authority if it had given a positive reply to the claim laid
before it by the Federal Republic of Germany, instead of embarking on
the construction of a thesis on preferential rights, zones of conservation of
fish species, or historic rights, on which there has never been any dispute,
nor even the slightest shadow of a controversy on the part either of the
Applicant or of the Respondent.

Furthermore, it causes me some concern also that the majority of the
Court seems to have adopted the position which is apparent in the present
Judgment with the intention of pointing the way for the participants in
the Conference on the Law of the Sea now sitting in Caracas.

The Court here gives the impression of being anxious to indicate the
principles on the basis of which it would be desirable that a general inter-
national regulation of rights of fishing should be adopted.

I do not discount the value of the reasons which guided the thinking
of the majority of the Court, and the Court was right to take account of
the special situation of Iceland and its inhabitants, which is deserving of
being treated with special concern. In this connection, the same treatment
should be contemplated for all developing countries in the same position,
which cherish the hope of seeing all these fisheries problems settled, since
it is at present such countries which suffer from the anarchy and lack of
organization of international fishing. But that is not the question which
has been laid before the Court, and the reply given can only be described
as evasive.

In taking this viewpoint I am not unaware of the risk that I may be
accused of not being in tune with the modern trend for the Court to
arrogate a creative power which does not pertain to it under either the
United Nations Charter or its Statute. Perhaps some might even say that
the classic conception of international law to which I declare allegiance
is out-dated; but for myself, 1 do not fear to continue to respect the
classic norms of that law. Perhaps from the Third Conference on the
Law of the Sea some positive principles accepted by all States will emerge.
I hope that this will be so, and shall be the first to applaud—and further-
more I shall be pleased to see the good use to which they can be put, in
particular for the benefit of the developing countries. But since | am
above all faithful to judicial practice, 1 continue fervently to urge the



need for the Court to confine itself to its obligation to state the law as
it is at present in relation to the facts of the case brought before it.

I consider it entirely proper that, in international law as in every other
system of law, the existing law should be questioned from time to time
—this is the surest way of furthering its progressive development—but
it cannot be concluded from this that the Court should, for this reason
and on the occasion of the present dispute between Iceland and the
Federal Republic of Germany emerge as the begetter of certain ideas
which are more and more current today, and are even shared by a
respectable number of States, with regard to the law of the sea, and which
are in the minds, it would seem, of most of those attending the Conference
now sitting in Caracas. It is advisable, in my opinion, to avoid entering
upon anything which would anticipate a settlement of problems of the
kind implicit in preferential and other rights.

To conclude this declaration, I think I may draw inspiration from the
conclusion expressed by the Deputy Secretary of the United Nations
Sea-Bed Committee, Mr. Jean-Pierre Lévy, in the hope that the idea it
expresses may be an inspiration to States, and Iceland in particular
which, while refraining from following the course of law, prefers to
await from political gatherings a justification of its rights.

I agree with Mr. Jean-Pierre Lévy in thinking that:

““., . it is to be hoped that States will make use of the next four or
five years to endeavour to prove to themselves and particularly to
their nationals that the general interest of the international community
and the well-being of the peoples of the world can be preserved by
moderation, mutual understanding, and the spirit of compromise;
only these will enable the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea
to be held and to succeed in codifying a new legal order for the sea
and its resources” (‘“La troisième Conférence sur le droit de la mer”,
Annuaire français de droit international, 1971, p. 828).

In the expectation of the opening of the new era which is so much
hoped for, I am honoured at finding myself in agreement with certain
Members of the Court like Judges Gros, Petrén and Onyeama for whom
the golden rule for the Court is that, in such a case, it should confine
itself strictly within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred on it.

Judge NAGENDRA SINGH makes the following declaration:

There are certain valid reasons which weigh with me to the extent that
they enable me to support the Judgment of the Court in this case and



hence I consider them of such importance as to be appropriately em-
phasized to convey the true significance of the Jud gment—its extent as
well as its depth. These reasons, as well as those aspects of the Judgment
which have that importance from my viewpoint are briefly stated as
follows:

While basing its findings on the bilateral law, namely the Exchange of
Notes of 1961 which has primacy in this case, the Court has pronounced
upon the first and second submissions of the Applicant's Memorial on
the merits, in terms of non-opposability to the Federal Republic of
Germany as requested by the Applicant. This suffices for the purpose of
that part of the Judgment. It was, therefore, not necessary for the Court
to adjudicate on that aspect of the first submission which relates to the
general law.

In the special circumstances of this case the Court has, therefore, not
proceeded to pronounce upon that particular request of the Applicant
which asks the Court to declare that Iceland's extension of its exclusive
fishery limit to 50 nautical miles has no basis in international law which
amounts to asking the Court to find that such extension is ipso jure
illegal and invalid erga omnes. Having refrained from pronouncing on
that aspect it was, consequently, unnecessary for the Court to pro-
nounce on the Applicant’s legal contention in support of its first
submission, namely, that a customary rule of international law exists
today imposing a general prohibition on extension by States of their
fisheries jurisdiction beyond 12 miles.

There is still a lingering feature of development associated with the
general law. The rules of customary maritime law relating to the limit of
fisheries jurisdiction have still been evolving and confronted by a widely
divergent and, discordant State practice, have not so far crystallized.
Again, the conventional maritime law though substantially codified by
the Geneva Conferences on the Law of the Sea of 1958 and 1960 has
certain aspects admittedly left over to be settled and these now constitute,
among others, the subject of subsequent efforts at codification. The
question of the extent of fisheries jurisdiction which is still one of the
unsettled aspects could not, therefore, be settled by the Court since it
could not “render judgment sub specie legis ferendae, or anticipate the
law before the legislator has laid it down”.

This is of importance to me but I do not have to elaborate this point
any further since I have subscribed to the views expressed by my col-
leagues in the joint separate opinion of the five Judges wherein this
aspect has been more fully dealt with.




The contribution which the Judgment makes towards the development
of the Law of the Sea lies in the recognition which it gives to the concept
of preferential rights of a coastal State in the fisheries of the adjacent
waters particularly if that State is in a special situation with its population
dependent on those fisheries. Moreover, the Court proceeds further to
recognize that the law pertaining to fisheries must accept the primacy for
the need of conservation based on scientific data. This aspect has been
properly emphasized to the extent needed to establish that the exercise
of preferential rights of the coastal State as well as the historic rights of
other States dependent on the same fishing grounds, have all to be
subject to the over-riding consideration of proper conservation of the
fishery resources for the benefit of all concerned. This conclusion would
appear warranted if this vital source of man’s nutrition is to be preserved
and developed for the community.

In addition there has always been the need for accepting clearly in
maritime matters the existence of the duty to “have reasonable regard to
the interests of other States’ —a principle enshrined in Article 2 of the
Geneva Convention of the High Seas 1958 which applies even to the
four freedoms of the seas and has weighed with the Court in this case.
Thus the rights of the coastal State which must have preference over the
rights of other States in the coastal fisheries of the adjacent waters have
nevertheless to be exercised with due regard to the rights of other States
and the claims and counter-claims in this respect have to be resolved on
the basis of considerations of equity. There is, as yet, no specific con-
ventional law governing this aspect and it is the evolution of customary
law which has furnished the basis of the Court’s Judgment in this case.


The Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, taking
into consideration the special field in which it operates, has a distinct
role to play in the administration of justice. In that context the resolving
of a dispute brought before it by sovereign States constitutes an element
which the Court ought not to ignore in its adjudicatory function. This
aspect relating to the settlement of a dispute has been emphasized in more
than one article of the Charter of the United Nations. There is Article 2,
paragraph 3, as well as Article |, which both use words like “adjustment
or settlement of international disputes or situations”, whereas Article 33
directs Members to “seek a solution” of their disputes by peaceful means.

Furthermore, this approach is very much in accordance with the
jurisprudence of the Court. On 19 August 1929 the Permanent Court of



International Justice in its Order in the case of the Free Zones of Upper
Savoy and the District of Gex (P.C.1.J., Series A, No. 22, at p. 13) observed
that the judicial settlement of international disputes is simply an alter-
native to the direct and friendly settlement of such disputes between the
parties. Thus if negotiations become necessary in the special circumstances
of a particular case the Court ought not to hesitate to direct negotiations
in the best interests of resolving the dispute. Defining the content of the
obligation to negotiate, the Permanent Court in its Advisory Opinion
of 1931 in the case of Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland
(P.C.1.J., Series A] B, No. 42, 1931, at p. 116) observed that the obligation
was ‘“‘not only to enter into negotiations, but also to pursue them as far
as possible, with a view to concluding agreements” even if ‘‘an obligation
to negotiate does not imply an obligation to reach an agreement”. This
does clearly imply that everything possible should be done not only to
promote but also to help to conclude successfully the process of negotia-
tions once directed for the settlement of a dispute. In addition we have
also the North Sea Continental Shelf cases (1.C.J. Reports 1969) citing
Article 33 of the United Nations Charter and where the Parties were to
negotiate in good faith on the basis of the Judgment to resolve the
dispute.

Though it would not only be improper but quite out of the question
for a court of law to direct negotiations in every case or even to con-
template such a step when the circumstances did not justify the same, it
