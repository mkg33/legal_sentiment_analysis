                       1. I have voted in favour of the adoption of the present Judgment in
                    the case of Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic
                    Republic of the Congo), whereby the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
                    has ordered reparations for the damages suffered by Mr. A. S. Diallo
                    (established in the previous Judgment on the merits, of 30 November
                    2010), as an individual, under the UN Covenant on Civil and Political
                    Rights (Art. 13), and under the African Charter on Human and Peoples’
                    Rights (Article 12 (4)), as well as under the Vienna Convention on
                    Consular Relations (his right to information on consular assistance,
                    ­
                    under Article 36 (1) (b)). In the present Judgment, in determining the
                    reparations due ultimately to Mr. A. S. Diallo, as a result of the damages
                    he suffered (para. 57), the ICJ has rightly taken into account the experi-
                    ence of other contemporary international tribunals in the matter of repa-
                    rations for damages.

                       2. Amongst those tribunals, of particular importance is the case law of
                    the international tribunals of human rights (in particular that of the Inter-
                    American and the European Courts of Human Rights), as I shall seek to
                    demonstrate in the present separate opinion. Although I have agreed with
                    the Court’s majority as to the determination of reparations in the present
                    Judgment, there are some points, not fully reflected in the reasoning of
                    the Court, that I feel obliged to dwell upon in the present separate opin-
                    ion, so as to clarify the matter dealt with by the Court, and the founda-
                    tions of my personal position thereon. One of the key points concerns the
                    position of individuals as subjects of contemporary international law,
                    and, accordingly, as titulaires of the right to reparation for the damages
                    they have suffered.

                         3. My reflections, developed in the present separate opinion, pertain to
                      other points as well, at conceptual and epistemological levels, namely :
                      (a) the subject of the rights breached and the subject of the right to repa-
                      rations ; (b) neminem laedere : insights on reparations from the “founding
                    fathers” of the law of nations (droit des gens) ; (c) the dawn of State
                    responsibility and the rationale of duty of reparations ; (d) an indissolu-
                      ble whole : breach of international law and compliance with the duty of
                      reparation for damages ; (e) the centrality of the victims in human rights
                      protection, and its implications for reparations, and the distinct forms of
                      these latter ; (f) assessment of the contribution of the case law of the
                      international human rights tribunals (in particular that of the Inter‑­
                      American and the European Courts of Human Rights) ; (g) neminem
                    ­laedere and reparation for moral damage to individuals ; and (h) the
                     ­relevance of the rehabilitation of victims. The way will then be paved, in
                      the epilogue, for the presentation of my concluding reflections on the
                      matter.

                       4. In its Judgment on the merits (of 30 November 2010) in the present
                    case, the Court established the violations of the rights of Mr. Diallo “as
                    an individual” (I.C.J. Reports 2010 (II), p. 655, para. 34), namely, his
                    rights under Article 13 of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
                    and under Article 12 (4) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’
                    Rights, in addition to his right to information on consular assistance
                    under Article 36 (1) (b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Rela-
                    tions 1. This was the first time in its history that the Court established
                    violations of human rights, under two human rights treaties, in addition
                    to the relevant provision of the 1963 Vienna Convention.


                       5. The subject of the rights violated in the cas d’espèce was a human
                    being, Mr. A. S. Diallo, not a State. Likewise, the subject of the corre-
                    sponding right to reparation is a human being, Mr. A. S. Diallo, not a
                    State. He is the titulaire of such right to reparation, and the beneficiary of
                    the reparations ordered by the Court in the present Judgment. In the pre-
                    vious Judgment on the merits (of 30 November 2010) the Court referred
                    to the reparation — in the form of compensation — “due to Guinea for
                    the injury suffered by Mr. Diallo” (ibid., p. 691, para. 161). The Court
                    further referred to the compensation owed by the Democratic Republic of
                    the Congo to Guinea “for the injury flowing from the wrongful deten-
                    tions and expulsion of Mr. Diallo in 1995‑1996, including the resulting
                    loss of his personal belongings” (ibid., p. 691, para. 163).
                       6. In the subsequent proceedings as to reparations (written phase
                    only), Guinea referred repeatedly, in its Memorial of 6 December 2011, to
                    the damages 2 or injuries 3 or harms 4 suffered by Mr. Diallo, to the dis-
                    crimination 5 and arbitrariness 6 inflicted against him. It also referred to
                    the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s breaches of human rights obli-
                    gations 7. For its part, in its Counter‑Memorial of 21 February 2012, the
                    Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) acknowledged the injuries 8 or
                    damages 9 suffered by Mr. Diallo. The two contending Parties thus agreed
                    that reparations were here due to the victim, for the human rights viola-
                    tions he suffered. The titulaire of the rights breached, and the beneficiary
                    of the reparations due, was the individual concerned, Mr. A. S. Diallo.

                    inter‑American system of human rights, concerning Haiti 10. And, for its
                    part, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in its Counter‑Memorial,
                    invoked a series of decisions from the European and the Inter‑American
                    Courts of Human Rights and surveyed them 11, stressing their importance
                    for the determination of “compensation for non‑pecuniary damage suf-
                    fered by individuals” 12. The Democratic Republic of the Congo made a
                    point of stressing that it deemed it fit to draw on the case law of the
                    Inter‑American and European Courts of Human Rights as the corre-
                    sponding two regional systems of human rights protection

                              “are the oldest and best developed in the world and which have abun-
                              dant practice in fixing compensation to make good the non‑pecuniary
                              damage resulting from wrongful and prolonged detentions of physical
                              persons by certain States. In the light of the jurisprudence of these
                              two international courts, the Respondent will submit its own proposal
                              to the Court regarding the amount of compensation which it consid-
                              ers reasonable and proportionate in relation to the non‑pecuniary
                              damage suffered by Mr. Diallo.” 13
                       8. In its present Judgment on reparations the Court has recalled its
                    finding in its previous Judgment on the merits (I.C.J. Reports 2010 (II),
                    p. 691, para. 163) in the cas d’espèce, whereby the amount of compensa-
                    tion due to Mr. A. S. Diallo is based on the damage suffered resulting
                    from his “wrongful detentions and expulsion” in 1995‑1996 and the con-
                    sequent “loss of his personal belongings” (Judgment, para. 11). The whole
                    reasoning of the Court is developed on the basis of the damages suffered
                    by Mr. A. S. Diallo, as established by it in its earlier Judgment on the
                    merits (of 30 November 2010). In the present Judgment, the Court reiter-
                    ates its position that the damages were done to Mr. A. S. Diallo, the
                    individual victim (ibid., para. 57), not to his State of nationality or origin.
                    
                       9. The fact that the mechanism for dispute‑settlement by the ICJ is, as
                    disclosed by its interna corporis, an inter‑State one, does not mean that
                    the Court’s findings, and its corresponding reasoning, ought to be invari-
                    ably limited to a strict inter-State approach. Not at all ; in their contents,
                    cases vary considerably, and, throughout the last decades, some of them
                    have directly concerned the condition of individuals. I have had the occa-
                    sion to point this out in my separate opinion in the Court’s recent Advi-
                    sory Opinion on Judgment No. 2867 of the International Labour
                    Organization Administrative Tribunal upon a Complaint Filed against the

                    in the Diallo case (Judgment on Reparations).


                       10. Notorious examples in that sense are provided, e.g., by the Notte‑
                    bohm case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) (1955, on double nationality) ; the
                    case concerning the Application of the Convention of 1902 Governing the
                    Guardianship of Infants (Netherlands v. Sweden) (1958) ; the case of the

                    (1995) ; the case of the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
                    Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia‑Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia)
                    (1996) ; the case of Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and
                    Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria) (1996) ; the case of Armed Activities on the
                    Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda)
                    (2000) ; the three successive cases concerning consular assistance — namely,
                    the cases “Breard” (Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Paraguay v.
                    United States) (1998)) ; LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America)
                    (2001) ; and Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States
                    of America) (2004) ; the case on Questions relating to the Obligation to
                    Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal) (Order of 2009) ; the case of
                    Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of
                    the Congo) (2010) ; the case of the Application of the International Conven‑
                    tion on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v.
                    Russian Federation) (2011) ; the case of the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cam‑
                    bodia v. Thailand) (Order of 2011) ; and the case of the Jurisdictional
                    Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy) (2010-2012).
                       11. The insufficiency, if not artificiality, of the exclusively inter‑State
                    outlook of the procedures before the ICJ has become manifest, in the
                    light of the very nature of some of the contentious cases submitted to it.
                    The same has been disclosed by the exercise of its advisory function, as
                    illustrated by its last two Advisory Opinions, on the Accordance with
                    International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Respect
                    of Kosovo (2010), and on Judgment No. 2867 of the International Labour
                    Organization Administrative Tribunal upon a Complaint Filed against the
                    International Fund for Agricultural Development (2012). Despite the limi-
                    tations of the inter‑State conception of its mechanism of operation, the
                    Court can at least disclose its preparedness to reason in the light of the
                    progressive development of international law, thus contributing to it,
                    beyond the outdated inter‑State outlook.
                       12. In effect, in the present Diallo case, the Court’s Judgments on the
                    merits (2010) and now on reparations clearly show that its findings and
                    reasoning have rightly gone well beyond the straight‑jacket of the strict
                    inter-State dimension. There are circumstances wherein the Court is
                    bound to do so, in the faithful exercise of its judicial function, in cases
                    concerning distinct aspects of the condition of individuals. After all,

                    breaches of international law are perpetrated not only to the detriment of
                    States, but also to the detriment of human beings, subjects of rights —
                    and bearers of obligations — emanating directly from international law
                    itself. States have lost the monopoly of international legal personality a
                    long time ago.

                       13. Individuals — like States and international organizations — are
                    likewise subjects of international law. A breach of their rights entails the
                    obligation to provide reparations to them. This is precisely the case of
                    Mr. A. S. Diallo ; the present case bears eloquent witness of that, and of
                    the limits imposed by contemporary international law upon State volun-
                    tarism. States cannot dispose of human beings the way they want, irre-
                    spective of their rights acknowledged in the corpus juris of the international
                    law of human rights ; if they breach their rights enshrined therein, they
                    are to bear the consequences thereof, in particular the ineluctable obliga-
                    tion to provide reparation to the individual victims.


                                 III. Neminem Laedere : Insights on Reparations
                                           from the “Founding Fathers”
                                     of the Law of Nations (Droit des Gens)

                      14. This duty of reparation has deep historical roots, going back to the
                    origins of the law of nations : such duty was in fact in the minds of the
                    “founding fathers” of our discipline, as disclosed by their classical writ-
                    ings which have survived the onslaught of time. The present Diallo case,
                    unique in the history of this Court — as I pointed out in my separate
                    opinion in its earlier Judgment on the merits (of 30 November 2010) —
                    seems to provide an invitation to embark on the rescue of the earlier
                    thinking on such duty of reparation. In effect, in his celebrated Second
                    Relectio de Indis (1538‑1539), Francisco de Vitoria made a proposition to
                    the effect that “the enemy who has done the wrong is bound to give all
                    this redress” 14; there is a duty, even amidst armed hostilities, to make
                    restitution (of losses) and to provide reparation for “all damages” 15.

                      15. One was here in the realm of jus gentium, the law of nations, of all
                    peoples, wherein the right to redress was reckoned 16. The rules of that
                    emerging law of nations were to be “just and fitting for all persons” ; the

                    damages caused by wrongful acts were to be assessed, in order to provide
                    redress to those who suffered them, and restitution of the losses 17. In
                    de Vitoria’s understanding, redress of wrongs was to take place in dis-
                    putes between States, or between groups, or between individuals, i.e., in
                    all sorts of disputes. He viewed the international community of (emerg-
                    ing) States as “co-extensive with humanity” ; such redress corresponded,
                    in his conception, to “an international need” 18.
                       16. Hugo Grotius, for his part, dedicated a whole chapter of his De
                    Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625) to the obligation of reparation for damages
                    (Book II, Chap. XVII) 19. In his outlook, the “injured party” was not nec-
                    essarily a State ; he referred to distinct kinds of damage caused by breaches
                    of “rights resulting to us”, or from “losses suffered by negligence” ; such
                    damages or losses create an obligation of reparation 20. In his conception
                    of the jus gentium, the (emerging) law of nations, H. Grotius focused on
                    the reasonable, on the dictates of the right reason, bearing in mind also
                    the common needs and, ultimately, the universal human society.

                      17. Samuel Pufendorf, likewise, in his Elementorum Jurisprudentiae
                    Universalis — Libri Duo (1672), asserted that whoever has caused damage
                    by a wrongful act is bound “to make good” and “to restore as much as
                    he contributed to the damage” 21. In this duty of restitution, each one
                    was bound to provide reparation for the damage he caused, “to restore
                    the whole”, on the basis of natural law 22. In his work On the Duty of
                    Man and Citizen (1673), Pufendorf pondered that one who has suffered
                    loss or damage cannot live in peace with the wrongdoer, without com­
                    pensation ; hence the need of restitution. Natural law, attentive to the
                    sociable (sociabilis), condemned vengeance 23. “Natural equity” set forth
                    the “obligation to make restitution” for loss or harm done with malice or
                    negligence 24.

                       18. For his part, Christian Wolff held, in his Jus Gentium Methodo
                    ­Scientifica Pertractatum (1764), that whoever caused a loss or wrong
                     “to a citizen or subject of another State” is “bound to repair it” ; the same
                     applies in the relations among nations, wherein “the loss caused should
                     be repaired” 25. Any international wrong — he added — entails the duty
                    of reparation, or of restoration of the loss 26. In his Principes du droit de la
                    nature et des gens (1758), Wolff situated the duty to provide reparation
                    for the damage caused in the realm of natural law thinking 27.

                       19. To the writings, on the subject-matter at issue, of Vitoria, Gro-
                    tius, Pufendorf and Wolff, others could be added, such as the ponder-
                    ation of Alberico Gentili (De Jure Belli, 1598) and of Francisco Suárez
                    (De Legibus ac Deo Legislatore, 1612), as to the need of a legal system
                    that would regulate the relations of the members of the universal societas
                    gentium, and the approach pursued by Cornelius van Bynkershoek (De
                    Foro Legatorum, 1721 ; Questiones Juris Publici — Libri Duo, 1737), in
                    keeping on upholding a multiplicity of subjects of jus gentium (nations,
                    peoples, persons). By and large, the attention to the common condition of
                    humankind was proper to natural law, which, with the recta ratio, pro-
                    vided the basis for the regulation of human relations with the due respect
                    for each other’s rights 28. The duty of reparation responded to an interna‑
                    tional need, in conformity with the recta ratio — whether the beneficiaries
                    were States (emerging in their days), peoples, or individuals.

                       20. Subsequent to the works of Pufendorf and Wolff (supra), interna-
                    tional legal thinking embarked on the reductionist path of the jus inter
                    gentes pursuant to a much stricter inter‑State outlook. The juxtaposition
                    of absolute State sovereignties led to the exclusion from that legal order
                    of the individuals as subjects of rights (titulaires de droits). At interna-
                    tional level, the States assumed the monopoly of the condition of subjects
                    of rights ; the individuals, for their protection, were left entirely at the
                    mercy of the discretionary intermediation of their nation-States. The
                    international legal order thus erected — which the excesses of legal posi-
                    tivism attempted in vain to justify — excluded therefrom precisely the
                    ultimate addressee of the juridical norms : the human being.

                       21. The teachings of the “founding fathers” of the law of nations, how-
                    ever, never faded away. Successive grave violations of the rights of the
                    human person (some on a massive scale) awakened human conscience to
                    the need to restore to the human being the central position from where he
                    had been unduly displaced by the exclusive inter‑State thinking which
                    prevailed in the nineteenth century. The reconstruction, on human foun-
                    dations, as from the mid‑twentieth century onwards, took, as conceptual
                    basis, the canons of the human being as subject of rights (titulaire de
                    droits), of the collective guarantee of the realization of these latter, and of
                    the objective character of the obligations of protection, and of the realiza-
                    tion of superior common values. The individual came again to be per-
                    ceived as subject of the right to reparation for damages suffered.



                                      IV. The Dawn of State Responsibility
                                    and the Rationale of Duty of Reparation

                       22. In effect, as from the late nineteenth century, some jurists had the
                    intuition to dwell upon reparation for international wrongs, even before
                    the advent of the era of (contemporary) international tribunals. They
                    wrote within distinct theoretical frameworks. One of the earlier jurists to
                    do so was Dionisio Anzilotti. On the one hand, his views on the legal
                    standing of individuals (acknowledged by him only in positive domestic
                    law) 29 became promptly and wholly unacceptable, even in the emerging
                    legal doctrine of his times ; this was largely due to the gradual establish-
                    ment of the direct contacts between individuals and the international
                    legal order (as from, e.g., the pioneering case law of the Central American
                    Court of Justice, 1907‑1917, followed by the Advisory Opinion of 1928 of
                    the Permanent Court of International Justice [PCIJ] on the Jurisdiction of
                    the Courts of Danzig, 1928) and the gradual recognition of the access of
                    individuals to international justice 30.


                       23. On the other hand, another concern expressed by Anzilotti, as to
                    the duty of reparation of damages resulting from breaches of interna-
                    tional law so as to preserve the integrity of the international legal order,
                    seems to retain its contemporaneity, over a century later. In fact, already
                    in 1902, in his book Teoria Generale della Responsabilità dello Stato nel
                    Diritto Internazionale, he pondered, in his conceptualization, that a viola‑

                    tion of international law (ensuing from an anti‑juridical fact, a factum
                    contra jus) generates responsibility 31; hence the need to cease that viola-
                    tion (in its effects) and to provide reparation for the damage 32. And Anzi-
                    lotti added that “il neminem laedere è norma giuridica fondamentale nei
                    rapporti degli Stati come in quelli degl’individui [the neminem laedere is a
                    fundamental juridical norm in the relations of States as in those of
                    individuals]” 33.

                       24. Four years later, Anzilotti stressed that any “act contrary to inter-
                    national law” engages international responsibility 34. To him, an “interna-
                    tional illicit act” is an act which is “in opposition with the objective
                    international law” ; thus, “le caractère illicite d’un acte dérive toujours de
                    son opposition avec le droit objectif” 35. To him, the damage is always
                    encompassed implicitly in the “anti‑juridical character of the act” 36. And
                    he added, with insight, that

                         “any act committed by a subject contrary to the rule [of law] entails
                         an obligation to restore, in one form or another, the juridical posi-
                         tion which that subject has disturbed.
                            [A] violation of international juridical standards by a State bound
                         by those standards thus gives rise to a duty to make reparation,
                         which generally consists in the restoration of the juridical position
                         that has been disturbed.” 37
                       25. In the following years, it became generally accepted that the duty
                    of reparation was one of general or customary international law. Another
                    international law theorist, Hans Kelsen, endeavoured in vain to challenge
                    that. In 1932, dwelling upon reparation, he built his conceptualization
                    within the straight‑jacket of the exclusive inter‑State dimension. He took
                    an isolated position (already in those days) to the effect that the duty of
                    reparation (compliance with which would in his view avoid recourse to
                    force and retaliation or reprisals) would necessarily require a prior agree‑
                    ment between the States concerned 38. Kelsen overlooked the general
                    acknowledgement, discernible already in his times, that that duty was one
                    of general or customary international law, and could not be entirely sub-

                    nis stood above the will of each State.

                       26. Yet, just as it happened with the theory of Anzilotti, in that of
                    Kelsen there is a concern which seems to have subsisted to date, retaining
                    its contemporaneity : reparation cannot “efface” the breach of interna-
                    tional law already committed, but it can rather avoid the negative conse-
                    quences of the wrongful act (i.e., recourse to force and reprisals on
                    the part of the affected State). In Kelsen’s own words, in dwelling upon
                    reparation,

                                 “Ihr Sinn liegt nicht darin, dass durch sie — wie ihr Name sagt —
                              ein begangenes Unrecht wieder ‘gut’ gemacht wird, denn dies ist
                              unmöglich. Der einmal gesetzte Unrechtstatbestand kann nicht aus
                              der Welt geschafft werden. Sondern ihr Sinn liegt darin, dass durch
                              sie kraft Rechtens der Eintritt der Unrechtsfolge ausgeschaltet wird.”
                              [Its significance does not lie with the fact that through such repara-
                              tion — as its name implies — a wrong that has already happened will
                              be repaired, as this is impossible. The wrongful behaviour cannot be
                              made to disappear from the world. Its significance lies with the fact
                              that through it, pursuant to a rule, the onset of the consequences of
                              the wrong is made impossible.] 39
                       27. Reparation, in Kelsen’s outlook, would thus contribute not only to
                    justice, but also to peace (a topic which was, later on, towards the end of
                    the Second World War, to attract his attention 40). In addition, he admit-
                    ted that reparation (for material and immaterial damage) might take dis-
                    tinct forms 41. On the obligation of reparation, the celebrated dictum of
                    the PCIJ in the Chorzów Factory case (Judgment of 26 July 1927) did not
                    escape his attention 42. Without abandoning his inter‑State approach, in
                    his Hague Academy lectures of 1953 he conceded, as to the obligation of
                    reparation, that “an international court must confine itself to finding that
                    an international obligation has been breached and to ordering reparation
                    for the injury caused” 43.


                      28. Despite the constraints of the traditional inter‑State outlook, the
                    rationale of reparation began to attract growing attention, and its con-

                    ceptual framework was gradually to take place. The PCIJ much contrib-
                    uted to that, in referring, in the aforementioned Chorzów Factory case, to
                    the obligation of reparation as corresponding to a principle of interna‑
                    tional law, and as conforming an “indispensable complement” to the
                    wrongful act, so as to efface all the consequences of this latter (i.e., the
                    provision of full reparation). In effect, support to the duty of reparation
                    came from distinct trends of opinion.

                      29. There were those who held, in the early twentieth century, that that
                    duty originated in the postulates of natural law. Amongst those was
                    Paul Fauchille, who, in 1922, lucidly pondered that the rules governing
                    the international responsibility of States, as to reparations,
                          “can be summed up in the natural law idea that any act causing injury
                          to others obliges whoever is responsible for that injury to make rep-
                          aration for it. This idea is applied in private law in the relations
                          between individuals ; there is no reason why it should not also be
                          applied in the relations between nations and between nations and
                          individuals.” 44
                    Depending on the circumstances of the cases, the duty of reparation for
                    damages may thus be performed to the benefit of States, or else of indi-
                    viduals, whoever has been injured. Parallel to the trend of jusnaturalist
                    thinking on the matter, there were also those who beheld the duty of
                    reparation in all legal systems of (positive) law, without which those sys-
                    tems would simply not exist 45.
                       30. In any case, attention began to be turned to the situation of the
                    victim, as beneficiary of reparation, and if there were treaties which pro-
                    vided for reparation, this was so — unlike what Kelsen had assumed —
                    because such treaties acknowledged a pre-existing and well‑established
                    principle of customary international law to the same effect 46. At the basis
                    of this principle, found in all national legal systems, was the “philosophi-
                    cal idea” which “translates the natural law precept ‘neminem laedere’” 47.
                    Be that as it may, reparation was already widely acknowledged as a pos-
                    tulate of customary international law, whereby a “prestation” is owed by
                    the wrongdoer to the victim, as a reparation for the harm done, and the
                    victim has the corresponding right to claim it 48. By the mid‑twentieth cen-
                    tury, it was possible to state, as Hildebrando Accioly did, that . . .“[t]he

                    general principle of the duty of reparation for injury is accepted through-
                    out the international order” 49.
                       31. Yet, there was a long way to go, in the progressive development of
                    reparation for injuries resulting from international wrongs. The matter
                    continued to be studied — as, in the era of the United Nations, in the
                    long‑standing work of the International Law Commission (mainly in the
                    period 1956-2001) —, largely in the framework of the relations among
                    States. With the gradual expansion of international legal personality (and
                    capacity), ineluctably accompanied by the corresponding expansion of
                    international responsibility, the need was felt to consider reparation for
                    damages in other and distinct contexts, beyond that of the strict inter‑State
                    framework of dispute‑settlement, which became conceptually unsatisfac-
                    tory.


                                            V. An Indissoluble Whole :
                                   Breach of International Law and Compliance
                                    with the Duty of Reparation for Damages

                       32. The domain of international responsibility is central to interna-
                    tional law, as without international responsibility the international legal
                    system would not exist. The duty of full reparation is the prompt and
                    indispensable complement of an internationally wrongful act, so as to
                    cease all the consequences ensuing therefrom, and to secure respect for
                    the international legal order 50. The duty of reparation within the realm of
                    international responsibility is attached to subjectivity in international law,
                    ensuing from the condition of being subject of rights and bearer of duties
                    in the law of nations (droit des gens) 51. The advent of the international
                    law of human rights and of contemporary international criminal law has
                    had the impact of clarifying this whole matter, leaving no doubts that
                    individuals — no longer only States — are also subjects of rights and
                    bearers of duties emanating directly from international law (the droit des
                    gens) 52.
                       33. The treatment to be dispensed to reparations was only to evolve,
                    and considerably so, with the advent of the international law of human
                    rights, being ineluctably victim‑oriented as it is. The imperative of compli-
                    ance with the duty of reparation was not to be limited to the avoidance of
                    sanctions or reprisals (as propounded by Kelsen, supra) at inter‑State
                    level. Beyond that advantage stood, in the domain of juridical epistemol-

                    ogy, the imperative of the realization of justice. The original breach or
                    violation of international law (irrespective of who committed it) came to
                    be regarded as forming an indissoluble whole with the compliance with the
                    duty of reparation (irrespective of who is its beneficiary).
                       34. This is so, irrespective of the circumstances of the case, as that
                    imperative, in my understanding, touches on the foundations of interna-
                    tional law. It was soon to meet with judicial recognition of the
                    Hague Court (both the PCIJ and the ICJ). Thus, as early as in 1927‑1928,
                    in the [aforementioned] Chorzów Factory case, the PCIJ invoked a pre-
