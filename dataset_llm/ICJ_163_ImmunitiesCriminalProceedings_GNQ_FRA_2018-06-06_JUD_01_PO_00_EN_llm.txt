                        of Justice by request in accordance with the Statute of the Court.”

                      45. Article I of the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention pro-
                    vides:
                          “Disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the
                        Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-
                        national Court of Justice and may accordingly be brought before the
                        Court by an application made by any party to the dispute being a
                        Party to the present Protocol.”
                       46. The Court recalls that, in order for it to determine whether a dispute
                    is one concerning the interpretation or application of a given treaty, it
                        “cannot limit itself to noting that one of the Parties maintains that
                        such a dispute exists, and the other denies it. It must ascertain
                        whether the violations [alleged] . . . do or do not fall within the pro-
                        visions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is
                        one which the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to entertain.”
                        (Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),
                        Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 810,
                        para. 16.)
                      47. Before addressing the preliminary objections of France, it is neces-
                    sary for the Court to determine the subject‑matter of the dispute.


                                      III. Subject-­Matter of the Dispute

                       48. Article 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute and Article 38, paragraph 1,
                    of the Rules of Court require an applicant to indicate the “subject of
                    the dispute” in the application. Furthermore, the Rules of Court require
                    that the application “specify the precise nature of the claim, together with
                    a succinct statement of the facts and grounds on which the claim is based”
                    (Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Rules) and that the memorial include a
                    statement of the “relevant facts” (Article 49, paragraph 1, of the Rules).
                    However, it is for the Court itself to determine on an objective basis the
                    subject‑matter of the dispute between the parties, by isolating the
                    real issue in the case and identifying the object of the claim. In doing so,
                    the Court examines the application as well as the written and oral plead-
                    ings of the parties, while giving particular attention to the formulation of
                    the dispute chosen by the applicant (Obligation to Negotiate Access to the
                    Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile), Preliminary Objection, Judgment,

                    of form.

                      49. The Court recalls that, in its Application filed on 13 June 2016,
                    Equatorial Guinea states that the dispute between the Parties arises from
                    certain ongoing criminal proceedings in France and concerns
                        “the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-­President
                        of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in charge of Defence and State
                        Security, and the legal status of the building which houses the Embassy
                        of Equatorial Guinea [in France], both as premises of the diplomatic
                        mission and as State property.
                           The criminal proceedings against the Second Vice-­President consti-
                        tute a violation of the immunity to which he is entitled under inter-
                        national law and interfere with the exercise of his official functions as
                        a holder of high-ranking office in the State of Equatorial Guinea. To
                        date, these proceedings have also resulted, inter alia, in the attachment
                        of the building located at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris, which is the prop-
                        erty of Equatorial Guinea and used for the purposes of its diplomatic
                        mission in France. These proceedings violate the Vienna Convention
                        on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961, the United Nations Con-
                        vention against Transnational Organized Crime of 15 November
                        2000, and general international law.”
                      50. The Application also states that
                        “the French Republic has breached its obligation to respect the prin-
                        ciples of the sovereign equality of States and non‑interference in the
                        internal affairs of another State, owed to the Republic of Equato-
                        rial Guinea in accordance with international law, by permitting its
                        courts to initiate criminal legal proceedings against the Second Vice-­
                        President of Equatorial Guinea for alleged offences which, even if
                        they were established, quod non, would fall solely within the jurisdic-
                        tion of the courts of Equatorial Guinea”.
                      51. Furthermore, Equatorial Guinea states in its Memorial that

                        “[t]he dispute between Equatorial Guinea and France arose from cer-
                        tain criminal proceedings initiated in France against Mr. Teo-
                        doro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Vice-­President of Equatorial Guinea
                        in charge of National Defence and State Security. In these proceed-
                        ings, the French courts have seen fit to ignore a number of acts and
                        decisions falling within the sole sovereignty and exclusive purview of
                        Equatorial Guinea, extend their criminal jurisdiction to its territory,
                        deny immunity from foreign criminal jurisdiction to the Vice-­President
                        in charge of National Defence and State Security, and disregard the

                        as the property of the State of Equatorial Guinea and as premises of
                        its diplomatic mission in France.”

                       52. Equatorial Guinea’s claims based on the Palermo Convention con-
                    cern, first, France’s alleged violation of the immunity from foreign crimi-
                    nal jurisdiction of Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, who is
                    currently Vice-­President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in charge
                    of National Defence and State Security. Secondly, the claims relate to
                    France’s alleged overextension of its criminal jurisdiction over predicate
                    offences associated with the crime of money laundering. Thirdly, the
                    claims pertain to France’s alleged failure to respect the immunity of the
                    building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris as State property of Equatorial
                    Guinea.

                       53. Equatorial Guinea’s claim based on the Vienna Convention con-
                    cerns France’s alleged failure to respect the inviolability of the building at
                    42 Avenue Foch in Paris as premises of Equatorial Guinea’s diplomatic
                    mission. Equatorial Guinea makes the following arguments in support of
                    its claims.

                                                          *
                       54. Regarding Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Equatorial
                    Guinea states that, although he was that country’s Ministre d’Etat for
                    Agriculture and Forestry when criminal proceedings were first initiated
                    before the French courts, he has assumed new responsibilities since his
                    appointment to the high‑ranking office of Second Vice-President of Equa-
                    torial Guinea in charge of Defence and State Security on 21 May 2012,
                    and of Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea in charge of National
                    Defence and State Security on 21 June 2016. According to Equatorial
                    Guinea, the nature of his new functions requires France to respect his
                    personal immunity in conformity with customary international law, in
                    particular as he is called upon to travel abroad on behalf of his
                    Government in order to perform those functions effectively. Equato-
                    ­
                    rial Guinea argues that the conduct of criminal proceedings against
                    Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue in France “constitute[s] a viola-
                    tion of the immunity [ratione personae] to which he is entitled under
                    international law and interfere[s] with the exercise of his official functions
                    as a holder of high‑ranking office in the State of Equatorial Guinea”. It
                    further contends that France’s conduct in this regard amounts to a
                    ­violation of “the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity
                     of States and that of non‑intervention in the domestic affairs of other
                     States” to which Article 4 of the Palermo Convention refers.

                      55. Regarding its claim that the Respondent has overextended its crim-
                    inal jurisdiction, Equatorial Guinea argues that France has

                        “unilaterally gone beyond the bounds of its criminal jurisdiction to
                        entertain and characterize alleged criminal offences (the predicate
                        offences associated with money laundering) which are said to have
                        been committed in the territory of Equatorial Guinea, by nationals
                        of Equatorial Guinea, and whose victims are Equatorial Guineans or
                        the State of Equatorial Guinea”.
                    The Applicant considers that the predicate offences in question are, by
                    their nature, offences whose sole victim would be the State of Equato-
                    rial Guinea, and that consequently, “only the State of Equatorial Guinea
                    is competent to take cognizance of them and in a position to determine
                    whether they have been committed”. Equatorial Guinea states further
                    that its Public Prosecutor investigated the alleged predicate offences and
                    found that there were no such offences committed in the territory of
                    Equatorial Guinea. According to Equatorial Guinea, Article 4 of the Pal-
                    ermo Convention requires that any characterization of predicate offences
                    must be carried out in a manner consistent with the principles of sover-
                    eign equality and non‑intervention in the internal affairs of another State.
                    Consequently, it contends, France’s unilateral determination that the
                    alleged predicate offences of misuse of corporate assets, misappropriation
                    of public funds, breach of trust and corruption were in fact committed in
                    Equatorial Guinea amounts to a violation of the principles of sovereign
                    equality and non‑intervention in the internal affairs of another State
                    reflected in Article 4 of the Palermo Convention.
                       56. Regarding its claim concerning the status of the building at 42 Ave-
                    nue Foch in Paris as State property, Equatorial Guinea asserts that
                    Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue previously owned that building in
                    his private capacity, having been since 18 December 2004 the sole share-
                    holder of the five Swiss companies that owned the building. However,
                    according to Equatorial Guinea, the building became State property on
                    15 September 2011, when Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue trans-
                    ferred all his shareholder rights therein to the State of Equatorial Guinea.
                    The Applicant further states that the transfer of the building to the State
                    of Equatorial Guinea was duly recorded and registered by the relevant
                    French authorities on 17 October 2011. Equatorial Guinea argues that
                    France, by failing to recognize the building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris as

                    Relying on this interpretation of Article 4, Equatorial Guinea asserts that
                    France has failed to carry out various obligations pursuant to the Pal-
                    ermo Convention in a manner that is consistent with Article 4, by failing
                    to respect the immunity to which the Vice-­President is entitled and the
                    immunity of the building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris from measures of
                    constraint as State property.

                       82. Second, Equatorial Guinea relies on the principles expressly
                    referred to in Article 4, asserting that France has failed to carry out vari-





5 CIJ1142.indb 57                                                                                   21/02/19 15:44

                               immunities and criminal proceedings (judgment)                 319

                    ous obligations under the Palermo Convention in a manner consistent
                    with those principles. In particular, Equatorial Guinea argues that France
                    has violated Article 4 by asserting jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 6
                    and 15 of the Palermo Convention over alleged offences which fall exclu-
                    sively within the jurisdiction of Equatorial Guinea’s courts.
                       83. Equatorial Guinea concedes that Article 4 does not require respect
                    for the principles of sovereign equality and non‑intervention (including the
                    rules on immunities of States and State officials which it claims flow from
                    those principles) in a general sense. It does not seek to dissociate Article 4
                    from the Convention’s other provisions. Rather, it argues that respect for
                    those principles becomes a treaty obligation for a State party when it is
                    applying the other provisions of the Convention. Equatorial Guinea
                    alleges that France has violated Article 4 in the implementation of Arti-
                    cle 6 (Criminalization of the laundering of proceeds of crime), Article 11
