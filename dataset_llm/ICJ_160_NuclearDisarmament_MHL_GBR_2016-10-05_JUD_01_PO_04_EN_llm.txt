   Jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36 (2) of Statute — Existence of a
dispute — No prior negotiations or notice necessary before seising Court —
Existence of a dispute a condition for exercise of jurisdiction — Dispute in principle
to exist at date of Application — Court has applied condition flexibly and taken
into account subsequent events — Proceedings clarified that a dispute between the
Marshall Islands and the United Kingdom exists — Court should have considered
other objections to jurisdiction.

   Admissibility — Article VI of 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons — Nature of obligations thereunder — Disarmament requires
co-operation between all States, in particular nuclear States — Court cannot
consider position of one nuclear State without considering and understanding
positions of other nuclear States — Absence of other nuclear powers before Court
prevents consideration of claims in proper multilateral context — Application
inadmissible.

   1. For the ﬁrst time in almost a century of adjudication of inter-State
disputes in the Peace Palace, the “World” Court (the Permanent Court of
International Justice and the International Court of Justice) has dismissed
a case on the ground that no dispute existed between the Applicant and
the Respondent prior to the ﬁling of the Application instituting proceed-
ings 1. The Court seems not to be interested in knowing whether a dispute
between them exists now.
   2. I am not convinced by the approach taken by the Court, despite
many references to its case law. In my view, other decisions of the Court,
and its predecessor, point in a diﬀerent direction. Therefore, to my regret,
I am unable to support the Court’s upholding of the objection based on
the absence of a dispute.

  3. Is it really the case that the Marshall Islands and the United King-
dom did not, by April 2014, have a dispute relating to the latter’s compli-
ance with Article VI of the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (hereinafter the “NPT”), and that they do not have
such a dispute now? Do the positions of the Marshall Islands and the
United Kingdom on the latter’s performance of its obligations under the
provisions of the NPT coincide?
  4. The Marshall Islands in its Application alleges, inter alia, that
         “[t]he United Kingdom has not pursued in good faith negotiations to
         cease the nuclear arms race at an early date through comprehensive
         nuclear disarmament or other measures, and instead is taking actions
         to improve its nuclear weapons system and to maintain it for the
         indeﬁnite future.
            Similarly, the UK has not fulﬁlled its obligation to pursue in good
         faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects
         under strict and eﬀective international control and instead has
         opposed the eﬀorts of the great majority of States to initiate such
         negotiations.” (Application instituting proceedings, pp. 12 and 14,
         paras. 15-16.)
On the basis of these allegations, the Marshall Islands requests the Court
to issue a declaratory judgment ﬁnding “that the United Kingdom has
violated and continues to violate its international obligations under the
NPT, more speciﬁcally under Article VI of the Treaty” through various
acts and omissions (emphasis added) 2. The Marshall Islands further
requests the Court
         “to order the United Kingdom to take all steps necessary to comply
         with its obligations under Article VI of the [NPT] and under custom-
         ary international law within one year of the Judgment, including the
         pursuit, by initiation if necessary, of negotiations in good faith aimed
         at the conclusion of a convention on nuclear disarmament in all its
         aspects under strict and eﬀective international control.” (Ibid., p. 60,
         para. 116.)

   5. The same submissions have been made by the Marshall Islands in its
Memorial ﬁled on 16 March 2015.
   6. There can be no doubt that the United Kingdom denies that it is in
breach of its obligations under the NPT. In its written pleading on prelimi-
nary objections, it made clear that “[t]he United Kingdom considers the
allegations to be manifestly unfounded on the merits.” Indeed, it was not
only in the pleadings that the United Kingdom rejected the views of the
Marshall Islands. While the Court was deliberating in this case, Her
Majesty’s Government took a decision to modernize the country’s nuclear
arsenal, through the replacement of four nuclear submarines, the
     2   For the full text of the request, see paragraph 11 of the Judgment.

decision having been approved by the Parliament at Westminster 3. Such
modernization appears to have been envisaged as being undertaken at great
expense, with an apparent intention that the system be used for several
decades to come 4. While it is not appropriate at this stage for me to take a
position on whether such a decision is in conformity with the United King-
dom’s obligations under the NPT, there cannot, in my mind, be any doubt
that it is in opposition to the view of the Marshall Islands, which is critical
of the United Kingdom “taking actions to improve its nuclear weapons
system and to maintain it for the indeﬁnite future” (see paragraph 4 above).

                                  I. Jurisdiction

  7. The United Kingdom has raised ﬁve preliminary objections. Accord-
ing to the ﬁrst one,
      “there is no justiciable ‘dispute’ between the Marshall Islands and the
      United Kingdom . . . within the meaning of this term in Articles 36 (2),
      38 (1) and 40 (1) of the Court’s Statute, Article 38 (1) of the Rules,
      and relevant applicable customary international law and jurispru-
      dence”.


The Respondent emphasizes that
      “[i]n particular, relying inter alia on the principle set out in Article 43
      of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsi-
      bility . . . and addressed in the Court’s recent judgments in Georgia v.
      Russia and Belgium v. Senegal, the United Kingdom contends that
      the failure by the Marshall Islands to give the United Kingdom any
      notice whatever of its claim renders the asserted dispute non-justicia-
      ble, with the eﬀect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to decide on
      the claims related thereto and/or making them inadmissible” (refer-
      ence omitted).
  8. The Court has concluded that it “does not have jurisdiction under
Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute” (Judgment, para. 58).

   9. It is to be recalled that the basis of jurisdiction relied upon by the
Marshall Islands is two declarations under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the
Statute of the Court, one deposited by the Marshall Islands on
24 April 2013 and the other by the United Kingdom on 5 July 2004.
   10. When analysing issues of jurisdiction, caution has to be taken in
relying on diﬀerent pronouncements of the Court, in particular, depend-
ing upon whether the basis invoked is Article 36 (2) declarations or a
compromissory clause contained in a treaty. Both declarations and com-
promissory clauses may set certain preconditions for the seising of the
Court. The Court’s jurisprudence has to be viewed in light of the relevant
provisions underpinning its jurisdiction in any given case.

   11. The Court in the present Judgment (see paragraph 38) recalls its
previous view, that when “[i]t has been seised on the basis of declarations
made . . . which . . . do not contain any condition relating to prior nego-
tiations to be conducted within a reasonable time” (Land and Maritime
Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Prelimi-
nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 322, para. 109), no
such negotiations are required prior to the ﬁling of the Application. In
the same Judgment, the Court clariﬁed that a State is “not bound to
inform [the other State] of its intention to bring proceedings before the
Court” (ibid., p. 297, para. 39).
   12. The United Kingdom’s reliance on the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility for its argument that the Marshall Islands’ failure to give
it any notice of its claims “renders the asserted dispute non-justiciable,
with the eﬀect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction” (see paragraph 7
above), is of no assistance to the Respondent. As the Court notes (see
paragraph 45 of the Judgment) the commentaries adopted by the Com-
mission state expressis verbis that “[t]he present articles are not concerned
with questions of the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, or
in general with the conditions for the admissibility of cases brought before
such courts or tribunals” 5.

   13. The United Kingdom also argues that “the existence of a legal dis-
pute” is one of “the conditions for the Court’s jurisdiction” and “must be
satisﬁed at the time of the Application”. It presents the argument also in
a modiﬁed form, stating that “[t]he existence of a dispute — a necessary
condition for the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction in terms of Arti-
cle 36 (2) of the Statute of the Court — must also be determined on [the]
date [on which the act instituting proceedings is ﬁled]” (emphasis added).

   14. Although the Court has, on a number of occasions, stated that the
existence of a dispute is a condition for its jurisdiction, in my view, it is
more properly characterized as a condition for the exercise of the Court’s
jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of this Court is based on the consent of
States. If States make declarations under Article 36 (2) of the Statute
“they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement,
in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation, the jurisdic-
tion of the Court in all legal disputes concerning [the matters speciﬁed in
letters (a) to (d) of that paragraph]”. The Court’s jurisdiction in relation
to a State which has made a declaration is established from the moment
the declaration is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, and remains in force as long as it is either not withdrawn or has
not lapsed if it has been made for a speciﬁed period of time. The Court
has explained that
      “by the deposit of its Declaration of Acceptance [of the Court’s juris-
      diction under Article 36 (2) of the Statute] with the Secretary-General,
      the accepting State becomes a Party to the system of the Optional
      Clause in relation to the other declarant States, with all the rights and
      obligations deriving from Article 36. The contractual relation between
      the Parties and the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court resulting
      therefrom are established, ‘ipso facto and without special agreement’,
      by the fact of the making of the Declaration.” (Right of Passage over
      Indian Territory (Portugal v. India), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
      ment, I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 146; emphasis added.)
The Court further speciﬁed that it is on the date when the second declar-
ant State deposits its Declaration of Acceptance “that the consensual
bond, which is the basis of the Optional Clause, comes into being between
the States concerned” (ibid.).
   15. Thus, it is not the emergence of a dispute which establishes the
Court’s jurisdiction or perfects it. The emergence of a dispute is a necessary
condition, in the event that one of the disputing parties which has accepted
