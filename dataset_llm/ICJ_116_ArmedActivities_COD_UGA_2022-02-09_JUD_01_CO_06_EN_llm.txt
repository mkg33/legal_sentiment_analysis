                   2. Following the failure of negotiations between the two States to
                determine the amount of reparation, it fell to the Court to establish that
                sum, in accordance with the operative part of the 2005 Judgment (ibid.,
                p. 281, para. 345 (6)). The total amount owed by Uganda has thus been
                fixed by the Court in today’s Judgment at US$325 million, which equates
                to less than 3 per cent of the amount sought by the DRC, of which it falls
                far short.
                   3. To my very great regret, I was unable to support the majority opin-
                ion as regards both the way in which the compensation was calculated
                and the amounts awarded for the human damage caused, be it loss of life,
                bodily harm or damage to personal property. Indeed, these are violations
                of the most basic human rights, resulting in sometimes indefensible harm
                (torture, rape, large-scale massacres) to thousands of Congolese, which,
                in my view, has been neither adequately taken into account nor suffi-
                ciently compensated.

                   4. I was, however, able to support the majority position with regard to
                natural resources. Although well below the sum claimed by the DRC,
                the amount awarded was in my view justified. In any event, I am not
                convinced that this form of damage greatly affected the day‑to‑day lives
                of the Congolese people, since the mining economy is not particularly
                distributive and profits are predominantly enjoyed by foreign States and
                groups. Moreover, these mineral resources, which the DRC has in abun-
                dance, have largely been a source of misery for its people: first, during
                colonization; then, at the time of independence, when Moïse Tshombé’s
                secession of Katanga, backed by foreign interests, plunged the country
                into chaos and required the intervention of the United Nations; not to
                mention the endemic unrest and various political upheavals that subse-
                quently afflicted the country and its people.

                   5. With the help of experts whose services were of varying assistance,
                the Court made a considerable — and commendable — effort to do its
                very best to fix what it considered to be the fairest possible compensation
                for the various heads of damage. I am therefore certainly not for one
                moment questioning either the quality of the Court’s work or its acute
                awareness of the seriousness of the issues at stake; I am simply express-
                ing, with all due respect to the Court, my disagreement with the result
                that it reached. To explain my position in this regard, it is necessary to
                examine the overall context of the DRC’s claims for compensation and to
                return first to the source, i.e. the 2005 Judgment.

                   6. In 2005, the Court declared Uganda responsible for various catego-
                ries of damage caused to the DRC. It did so in clear and unequivocal
                terms, which can be found throughout the Judgment. The Court notes
                “the magnitude of the military events and the attendant suffering” (2005
                Judgment, p. 224, para. 150), as well as the “unlawful” nature of those
                actions (ibid., para. 152). It finds that “[t]he unlawful military interven-
                tion by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court
                considers it to be a grave violation of the prohibition on the use of force
                expressed in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter” (ibid., p. 227,
                para. 165). The Court also speaks of “acts of killing, torture and other
                forms of inhumane treatment of the civilian population” (ibid., p. 241,
                para. 211), confirmed by “sufficient” “credible evidence” (ibid.). It refers
                to the “immense suffering” and the “many atrocities . . . committed”
                (ibid., p. 245, para. 221). It finds that the UPDF, which “failed to protect
                the civilian population” (ibid., p. 240, para. 208), “incited ethnic conflicts”
                in Ituri (ibid., para. 209) and “failed to take action to put an end to the
                violence” (ibid.). Several of these excerpts were recalled in the present
                Judgment (see paras. 51-57).
                   7. Given the need for consistency between the present Judgment and
                that delivered in 2005 — which I consider essential — I find it strange
                that, having so clearly established responsibilities in 2005, the Court has
                not today awarded compensation more in keeping with the resoluteness
                of that decision. In my view, the approach taken by the Court is flawed
                precisely because it is not consistent with the 2005 Judgment; in spite of
                the Court’s assertions (see Judgment, para. 68), it gives too much cre-
                dence to the punctilious formalism of Uganda’s lawyers with regard to
                evidence of damage and shows what I consider to be sometimes undue
                rigour given the context of this case. As a result, the present Judgment
                lacks the momentum of the 2005 decision.
                   8. In my opinion, there is also an obvious inconsistency — this time an
                internal one — between Parts II (paras. 60-131) and III (paras. 132-384)
                of the Judgment. Part II sets out “general considerations”, with which I
                readily agree. I understand this part of the Judgment to mean that while
                the requirements of proof and a causal nexus are fundamental, and
                the Court must ensure that they are respected, some flexibility is nonethe-
                less permissible for certain heads of damage, given the specific situation





6 Ord_1239.indb 381                                                                               27/06/23 08:16

                of the DRC, the victim of an especially cruel and devastating war (see
                paras. 66‑68).
                   9. This is followed by Part III, which I had expected to be some kind
                of practical application of, and thus to be entirely in line with, the prin-
                ciples identified in Part II, but which seems instead to be once more at a
                remove from and in some way out of step with those principles, in so far
                as it fails to apply the flexibility they encompass. This led to the adoption
                of particularly conservative levels of compensation, especially for damage
                to persons.
                   10. In a case such as this, which in many respects is exceptional, there
                is clearly a need to proceed with caution and, of course, to keep in mind
                that while the Judgment is binding only on the Parties, the Court’s posi-
                tions may nevertheless subsequently be relied on in other cases, some-
                times by extrapolation, to justify a stance. The Court must therefore take
                care not to create an opening which, on another occasion, would surely
                be exploited. And, still in view of the exceptional nature of this case, the
                Court cannot be criticized for carefully and strictly upholding the integ-
                rity of the principles of international law, in this instance the law of
                responsibility. Nevertheless, compliance with the law does not preclude a
                contextualization of the rules, which was absent here. The difficulty being,
                it is true, knowing where to stop.

                   11. The 2005 Judgment did not go into the details of specifically indi-
                vidualized damage, any more than the DRC did, for that matter, in the
                claims it made at a stage of the case concerning the establishment of
                responsibility rather than the forms and amount of reparation. In the cur-
                rent phase of determination of the quantum, greater precision is obvi-
                ously needed for the breakdown of what is eligible for compensation — and
                in what amount — and what is not, which poses difficulties in relation to
                evidence and the standard required for evidence to be established.
                   12. The DRC argued strongly that the specific situation of violence
                and disorder faced by the country during the period under consideration
                made it impossible, in practical terms, to gather evidence with the requi-
                site degree of precision. There is no point returning to the numerous
                examples of those difficulties mentioned by the DRC in its written plead-
                ings and during the oral argument. However, between the two extremes
                which consist in either regarding these particular difficulties as an exemp-
                tion from the need to provide proof or referring to them only as a matter
                of form, paying them lip service but not giving them due attention, there
                is room for a middle path, which, in my view, the Court should have
                taken.
                   13. Against the deeply troubling backdrop already clearly recorded in
                the 2005 Judgment, the disruption of public services and of all infrastruc-
                ture, as well as the victims’ low level of education, are presented in the
                present proceedings as insurmountable obstacles by the DRC (Judgment,
                para. 62). It is evident that when one flees into the Congolese forest, one





6 Ord_1239.indb 383                                                                             27/06/23 08:16

                                     armed activities (diss. op. daudet)                            203

                finds neither a doctor to record rape or injuries, nor an official from the
                civil registry to record deaths, nor a notary to issue the titles to property
                that will serve as evidence to found subsequent claims for compensation.
                The Court, which fully acknowledged this in adopting a nuanced and
                understanding position (Judgment, para. 158), certainly did not fail to
                draw attention to these facts, but, in my opinion, it did not take the next
                logical step and draw the practical consequences in its quantification of
                the damage, which is not marked by the same flexibility.

                   14. With this in mind, it is important to examine the nature of the acts
                committed and the effect it has on the standard of proof. The 2005 Judg-
                ment established that mass crimes had been perpetrated: in paragraph 207,
                the Court declares itself convinced that “massive human rights viola-
                tions . . . were committed by the UPDF” (I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 239)
                and, in paragraph 205, it states: “In order to rule on the DRC’s claim, it
                is not necessary for the Court to make findings of fact with regard to each
                individual incident alleged.” (Ibid., emphasis added.) In paragraph 211, it
                “considers that it has credible evidence sufficient to conclude that the
                UPDF troops committed acts of killing, torture and other forms of inhu-
                mane treatment of the civilian population” (ibid., p. 241).

                  15. In its written pleadings and oral argument, the DRC recalled that,
                as a general rule (not just in the case of mass crimes), the circumstances
                specific to each case may lead to evidentiary requirements being relaxed in
                accordance with the said circumstances. For example, in the case concern-
                ing Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa
                Rica v. Nicaragua) (Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I),
                p. 15), the Court, in paragraph 35, referring to the Diallo case, “recalls
                that the absence of adequate evidence as to the extent of material damage
                will not, in all situations, preclude an award of compensation for that
                damage” and mentions the “equitable considerations” which guided it in
                the Diallo case (ibid., pp. 26‑27). In the same paragraph, the Court quotes
                a well-known passage from the Arbitral Award in the Trail Smelter case,
                which makes a similar point:
                         “Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascer-
                      tainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it would be a
                      perversion of fundamental principles of justice to deny all relief
                      to the injured person, and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from making
                      any amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages may not be
                      determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the
                      evidence show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and rea-
                      sonable inference, although the result be only approximate.” 1

                  16. Flexibility was also shown by the Eritrea-­Ethiopia Claims Com-
                mission (EECC) 2 and by the ICC in the Lubanga 3 and Ntaganda 4 cases.

                   17. There is no doubt that, in the present case, the circumstances
                recalled above make it particularly difficult to gather precise evidence
                relating to events that took place more than 20 years ago in a country in
                which, since life expectancy is just 63 years (World Bank figure: https://
                data.worldbank.org/indicator), many of those involved have died in the
                meantime and their testimony can no longer be gathered. Yet the obser-
                vation I made earlier (see paragraph 13 supra) is equally applicable to
                paragraphs 66 to 68 of the Judgment, in which the Court emphasizes the
                effects of the time that has elapsed and the resulting difficulty in “estab-
                lishing the course of events and their legal characterization” (Judgment,
                para. 66). Somewhat surprisingly, however, the Court then observes that
                “more evidence relating to loss of life could be expected to have been col-
                lected [by the DRC] since the Court delivered its 2005 Judgment” (ibid.,
                para. 159). In other words, the time that has passed is regarded as an
                opportunity of which the DRC has failed to take advantage. From my
                perspective, it is quite the opposite: the passing of time is a factor in the
                loss of both material evidence (in Africa, the weather conditions may also
                contribute to the loss or destruction of documents and objects) and testi-
                mony, either on account of failing memory or, as I have just mentioned,
                because deaths occur. In fact, one of the reasons invoked in legal systems
                with a statute of limitations is the fragility of evidence relating to long-
                ago events. Hence my opposing view that these considerations would also
                have justified a show of leniency and flexibility on the part of the Court
                in Part III of the Judgment on reparations.
                   18. Despite there being factors that argue in favour of nuance and
                adapting as best as possible to a complex situation, the Court has con-
                fined itself to a very literal interpretation of paragraph 260 of the
                2005 Judgment. Paragraph 260 lies at the heart of Uganda’s arguments
                and is expressly relied on in its final submissions. It is therefore worth
                spending some time on it. In this paragraph, which concerns the hypo-
                thetical failure of negotiations leading to a later contentious phase to
                determine compensation for the DRC, the Court states that “[t]he DRC
                would thus be given the opportunity to demonstrate and prove the exact
                injury that was suffered as a result of specific actions of Uganda constitut-
                ing internationally wrongful acts for which it is responsible” (I.C.J.
                Reports 2005, p. 257, emphasis added). With this sentence, the Court is

                merely recalling the basic rules according to which, to be eligible for com-
                pensation, an injury must be proven and connected by a causal nexus to
                an internationally wrongful act.
                   19. In my view, when referring in paragraph 260 of the 2005 Judgment
                to the “exact injury” suffered by the DRC and “specific actions” of Uganda,
                the Court did not intend to make the principle of full reparation for injury
                caused by the internationally wrongful act (Article 31 of the International
                Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility) subject to more rigor-
                ous conditions. More specifically, I am not sure that it was the Court’s
                intention, in expressing itself in this way, to impose particular conditions
                on the presentation of claims by the DRC, or to confine itself in the future
                to a more stringent framework of requirements for the success of the forth-
                coming claims of that State, the victim of the “injury . . . caused . . . by
                Uganda” (I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 257, para. 259). For a number of the
                grounds of responsibility invoked by the DRC against Uganda, the
                2005 Judgment recognizes the existence of violations borne out by evidence
                that is “of a reliable quality” (ibid., p. 240, para. 208), “persuasive” (ibid.,
                para. 209), “credible” (ibid., p. 241, para. 211) and “convincing” (ibid.,
                para. 210). What remains to be “specified”, however, is the number of peo-
                ple who died or were injured, the number of child soldiers who were
                abducted, and so on. In paragraph 260, the Court is recalling the usual
                requirements in this regard, nothing more and nothing less. From there, I
                think that, in the present Judgment, the Court could have made better use
                of its power to apply this general rule taking greater account of the circum-
                stances of the case and, in so doing, could have adopted a stance in line
                with the one described above (see paragraph 15 above).
                   20. In other words, I do not consider the terms of paragraph 260 to
                have as rigid a meaning as that which is attributed to them by Uganda,
                and which is ultimately broadly adopted by the Court in Part III of its
                Judgment. It is true that the Court did not require the production of a
                medical certificate to prove a rape, nor a notarized title to prove the loss
                of a dwelling (see above, paragraph 13), but its exacting standards never-
                theless reduced the likelihood of adjustments being made for the situa-
                tion, circumstances, or local habits or customs. For example, the
                importance of the spoken word compared to the written word in Africa is
                well known and is such that, to prove a claim, oral testimony might be
                given instead of producing the written documentation that would exist
                elsewhere as a matter of course. Yet, as far as I am aware, the experts
                stayed in their offices and questioned no one. Finally, one must always
                keep in mind the specific context of violence and disorder prevailing in
                the DRC at the time the damage was caused.
                   21. Certainly, the more serious the acts and the higher the reparations
                claim, the more stringent the requirements to be met by the evidence. This
                is an important point to note. It was already highly unlikely that the
                DRC would receive the level of compensation it claimed, which was
                clearly disproportionate and completely beyond Uganda’s means. There
                was, in any event, absolutely no possibility of it receiving satisfaction





6 Ord_1239.indb 389                                                                                27/06/23 08:16

                without producing particularly solid evidence. Yet it must be acknowl-

                   22. To fix the amount of reparation for damage to persons, the Court
                (and the experts) used two parameters: the number of victims and the
                amount of compensation per person. The former is multiplied by the lat-
                ter to determine, after any adjustments, the sum to be paid as compensa-
                tion. The first figure depends on the evidence produced; the second, on
                the model applied. From the outset, there appears to be some room for
                uncertainty.

                    23. The point here is not to analyse the Court’s assessments in detail.
                In my view, the example of loss of life (Judgment, paras. 135-166) illus-
                trates both the extreme difficulty faced by the Court and the meticulous
                nature of the work it has carried out, albeit to reach a result which I
                consider questionable. It is an example which is often transposable to
                other heads of damage. In this instance, determining the number of
                ­victims reveals significant variations between the sources (ranging from
                 the 180,000 deaths put forward by the DRC, to the 14,663 proposed by
                 the expert, who nonetheless acknowledges that this figure may have been
                 underestimated). There is a problem here with the evidence provided
                 by the DRC, which the Court considers insufficient. It is true that some
                 of the victim identification forms — which, moreover, concern only some
                 of the deaths — were completed on an approximate basis (but how could
                 it have been otherwise?) and were therefore not particularly helpful. Other
                 sources did not, in the Court’s view, enable a sufficiently substantiated
                 causal nexus to be established. This cumulation of insufficient evidence
                 made it impossible to establish clear proof. After checking against other
                 sources of information deemed to be reliable, the Court ultimately
                 adopted the rather broad range of 10,000 to 15,000 deaths (close to the
                 figure of 14,663 deaths given by the expert, who, as I have just mentioned,
                 considers this likely to be an underestimation), having concluded that
                 there was insufficient evidence to confirm the 180,000 deaths put forward
                 by the DRC (ibid., paras. 161-162).
                    24. I was unconvinced by that conclusion and fail to understand why
                 the Court chose the lowest figure in a very broad range, despite the
                 acknowledgment that it was potentially an underestimation. Given the
                 obvious uncertainty which, for the reasons mentioned, surrounds
                 the numbers in question, I believe that, having excluded the highest fig-
                 ure, it would have been more justified, in view of the circumstances and
                 specific nature of the case, to start at a position above the lowest figure in
                 the range and then correct that position as necessary to reach an inter­
                 mediate level of compensation. Taking into account the length of the conflict
                 alone, the Court could have found that the figure of 14,663 lives lost was





6 Ord_1239.indb 391                                                                               27/06/23 08:16

                                   armed activities (diss. op. daudet)                    207

                clearly too low, since it was inconsistent with the scope and duration of
                Uganda’s military intervention as set out in paragraph 165 of the
                2005 Judgment. Had the Court preferred not to rely on that basic logic, it
                could have been guided in its decision-­   making by equitable consider-
                ations, reference to which was appropriate to try to refine the bases for
                compensation.

                   25. The examination of rape and sexual violence gave rise to the same
                approximations and uncertainties. The Court considered that the figure
                of 1,740 cases claimed by the DRC was not sufficiently proven (Judg-
                ment, para. 189) and that it was “impossible to derive even a broad esti-
                mate of the number of victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence”
                (ibid., para. 190). It nonetheless found that “it is beyond doubt that rape
                and other forms of sexual violence were committed in the DRC on a large
                and widespread scale” (ibid., para. 191), and recalled that, according to
                the ICC, this was a “common practice”. The Court also stated that it was
                “mindful that victims of sexual violence often experience psychological
                trauma and social stigma, and that, therefore, such violence is frequently
                underreported and notoriously difficult to document”, as noted by the
                EECC (ibid., para. 189). To this, one could add the stigma faced by and
                within families and the tragic lot of children born of rape. One could also
                listen to the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize lecture on this subject by Dr. Mukwege,
                who is more familiar than anyone with these painful issues.

                   26. In this instance, as in the case of loss of life, a more precise use of
                equity than that employed by the Court (which only mentioned equity
                without explaining how it was used) would have been desirable. Recourse
                to equitable considerations, whose importance has been affirmed and
                explained, would have been perfectly justified, and would not have
                infringed the rules and principles of international law. Indeed, it must be
                recalled that this form of equity is not contrary to international law but is
                merely intended to enable it to be better adapted to the circumstances.
                Although the Court refers to equity on several occasions in its Judgment,
                it does so as if only out of respect, without offering any further explana-
                tions or stating what action was taken to determine fair amounts of com-
                pensation for damage to persons and property (Judgment, paras. 166,
                181, 193, 206, 225 and 258). By awarding a global sum whose various
                components are not specified, the Court has rendered a decision which
                may be seen as approximate or vague.

                   27. In this regard, I regret the choice of a global sum covering such a
                broad array of heads of damage without distinction, ranging from loss of
                life (ibid., paras. 135-166) to injuries to persons (ibid., paras. 167-181),
                rape and sexual violence (ibid., paras. 182-193), the recruitment and
                deployment of child soldiers (ibid., paras. 194-206) and the displacement
                of populations (ibid., paras. 207-225). The way the Judgment is drafted, it





6 Ord_1239.indb 393                                                                              27/06/23 08:16


                is impossible to assess the share of compensation allocated to each head,
                which in some respects makes it difficult to apply the principle expressed
                by the Court in paragraph 102 of its Judgment, according to which

                      “any reparation is intended, as far as possible, to benefit all those who
                      suffered injury resulting from internationally wrongful acts (see
                      Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of
                      the Congo), Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I), p. 344,
                      para. 57)”.
                   28. It should nonetheless be recalled here that, at the opening of the
                hearings, following up on statements made in the Memorial (paras. 7.50-
                7.51) setting out the DRC’s intention to establish a fund that would allow
                individualized damage to be compensated, the Agent of the DRC
                informed the Court that a decree to that effect, binding on the DRC, had
                been adopted on 13 December 2019. A body comprising “representatives
                of the victims and . . . international experts, including one delegate of the
                United Nations system” has thus been put in place (CR 2021/5, pp. 22‑23).
                This commitment was reiterated by the Agent at the close of the hearings
                (CR 2021/11, p. 76).

                   30. In conclusion, this case vividly shows that the failure of negotia-
                tions between the two countries is extremely regrettable. Only good faith
                negotiations, had they been able to take place, could have brought to the
                fore the moral, humanist, economic and social foundations, in short, the
                fundamental principles that might have formed the necessary ground-
                work on which to base the requests of one side and the possible responses
                of the other. These principles might have resulted in greater and fairer
                compensation, but cannot form the basis of a decision of the Court.
                   31. The Court itself cannot simply put forward its firm conviction,
                likelihoods, or evidence from sources that are probably well informed but
                do not provide certainty, in lieu of proof or a causal nexus. A careful
                reading of the Judgment clearly shows the difficulties faced by the Court
                in this regard.

                  32. It is possible that, in negotiations, one point would have been given
                greater emphasis than it received in the Judgment, from which it is, in
                fact, absent. In its decision, the Court takes into account that, as a devel-
                oping country, Uganda has a limited capacity to pay and, without raising
                the question directly, alludes to it on three occasions: in paragraph 109, in
                which it refers to the position taken by Uganda, which wrongly claims





6 Ord_1239.indb 395                                                                               27/06/23 08:16

                                   armed activities (diss. op. daudet)                    209

                that “the relevant principles of international law” preclude requiring a
                debtor to pay compensation that exceeds its financial capacity, despite the
                absence of a concrete rule to that effect in international law; in para-
                graph 110, in which the Court mentions that this question was raised by
                the EECC and states that it “will further address the question of the
                respondent State’s financial capacity below (see paragraph 407)”; and in
                paragraph 407, in which the Court says little, declaring itself satisfied that
                Uganda has the capacity to pay, such that the question of “the financial
                burden imposed on the responsible State” is irrelevant. What is absent,
                however, is the “mirror image situation” in the DRC, which, like Uganda,
                is a developing country with, like Uganda, limited financial resources.
                The Judgment makes no mention, not even “in passing”, of whether the
                DRC has the capacity to bear the uncompensated share for which it
                remains liable, since it is clear that the DRC is not receiving full repara-
                tion for the injury it suffered, despite its clearly erroneous overstating of
                that injury, which would have led to punitive damages that could not
                have been paid in any event, as I mentioned above. Indeed, the Court
                recalled that “it is well established . . . that reparation due to a State is
                compensatory in nature and should not have a punitive character” (Judg-
                ment, para. 102). In my view, however, the DRC is being doubly pun-
                ished: it was a victim and it will receive insufficient compensation. One
                can imagine that, had it been possible for good faith negotiations to take
                place, this would have been taken into account, resulting in a balanced
                outcome. That is not what happened. It is to be hoped that the DRC will
                be able to overcome the understandably profound disappointment it is no
                doubt experiencing. May the two States resume the peaceful relations
                that their people desire as soon as possible.
