I agree with the majority of my colleagues that the Court does have
jurisdiction in this case. However, this case raises the important issue of
automatic succession to the Genocide Convention, which has not been
developed in the Court’s Judgment. I believe it warrants consideration.

One of the principal concerns of the contemporary international legal
system is the protection of the human rights and dignity of every indi-
vidual. The question of succession to the Genocide Convention raises one
of the most essential aspects of such protection.

The topic which I wish to address in this opinion is the continuing
applicability of the Convention to the populations to which it has applied.
When a convention so significant for the protection of human life has
been entered into by a State, and that State thereafter divides into two or
more successor States, what is the position of its subjects in the interim
period that elapses before the formal recognition of the successor States,
or before the new State’s formal accession to treaties such as the
Genocide Convention? I think this situation should not be passed by
without attention, especially having regard to the fact that the founda-
tions for a consideration of this matter are to be found in the Court’s
Opinion in the earlier case on genocide which came before it over forty
years ago (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951,
p. 15).

Another reason calling for attention to this topic is the fact that the
international community is passing through a historical period, when,
throughout the world, the phenomenon is being experienced of the splin-
tering of States. This has occurred with particular intensity especially
after the end of the Cold War. It is vitally important that the principle of
protection of populations against human rights abuses and atrocities
should be strengthened in every manner available under current legal
principles; and the clarification of the law relating to State succession to
a humanitarian treaty so important as the Genocide Convention is emi-
nently such an area.

Bosnia has contended that there is automatic succession to this treaty,
and Yugoslavia denies this proposition. This problem leads into the intri-
cate field of State succession to treaties — a field in which there has
been much difference of juristic opinion, and in which many competing
theories strive for recognition.

THEORIES RELATING TO STATE SUCCESSION

State succession is one of the oldest problems of international law.
As Oscar Schachter reminds us, this problem goes all the way back



to Aristotle who, in his Politics, gave his mind to the question of conti-
nuity when “the State is no longer the same”.

On this problem, the views of jurists have varied between the two poles
of universal succession (these were among the earliest theories, taking
their conceptual position largely from the analogy of the Roman law of
testamentary succession, involving a total succession to the deceased),
and of total negativism, involving a complete denial of succession (based
upon the conceptual analogy of a personal contract). It is not necessary
for present purposes to refer to the various theories lying between these
two extremes.

The circumstances of international life have demonstrated that neither
of these absolutist theories is adequate to cover all situations that might
arise and that any workable theory lies somewhere between these poles?
Quite clearly, whichever of these positions one might lean towards, some
exceptions must necessarily be admitted.

The question for consideration in this case is whether, even on the
basis of the negativist theory that treaties of the predecessor State are not
binding, a necessary exception must exist in relation to treaties such as
the Genocide Convention. Much guidance is to be had on this question
from the consideration of automatic succession to human rights and
humanitarian treaties in general. The discussions and literature on this
matter suggest a principle of automatic succession to a large range of
such treaties. This opinion does not seek to deal with all human rights
and humanitarian treaties, but uses principles worked out in the context
of such treaties to reach the conclusion that they apply a fortiori to the
Genocide Convention which, in consequence, is a treaty to which there is
automatic State succession according to the contemporary principles of
international law.

The principle that a new State ought not in general to be fettered with
treaty obligations which it has not expressly agreed to assume after it has
attained statehood (the clean slate principle) is of considerable historical
and theoretical importance. New States ought not, in principle, to be bur-
dened with treaty-based responsibilities without their express consent.

With the sudden advent into the international community of nearly
eighty newly independent States in the late fifties and early sixties, there
was a realization among them, in the words of Julius Stone, that:

“their authority or their territory or both are burdened with debts,
concessions, commercial engagements of various kinds or other obli-
gations continuing on from the earlier colonial regime . . .”3.

be applicable to the country“.

Other newly emerging countries soon became conscious of the dangers
to their autonomy involved in this principle, and what came to be known
as the Nyerere Doctrine emerged under which none of the colonial trea-
ties became applicable unless the new State, within a specified period of
time, notified its accession to such treaties. In the language of Jenks, in
relation to State succession to colonial treaties, “The psychology of newly
won independence is a formidable reality.”

This was not, however, the only historical reality that favoured the
clean slate theory. There were numerous older precedents, of which a few
illustrative examples may be mentioned. Following the Franco-Prussian
war and the transfer of Alsace-Lorraine, French treaties applicable to the

Commission on the very day of independence, the Federation assumed all rights and obli-
gations entered into “on their behalf” before independence, and undertook to keep such
agreements in force until the Government of Nigeria could consider whether they required
modification or renegotiation in any respect (E. G. Bello, op. cit., p. 298).

provinces had, in general’, to cease to have effect and be replaced by
German treaties. Again, British jurists, facing the problem of annexation
of colonial territories, tended towards the view that “the treaties of the
expunged legal person died with it” 8, so that they received those colonies
free of the burden of prior treaties. At the United Nations Conference on
Succession of States in Respect of Treaties®, several other examples were
referred to, among them the situation resulting from the termination of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when Czechoslovakia and Poland emerged
as independent States with a clean slate in regard to treaties of the former
Austro-Hungarian Empire, except for certain multilateral treaties !°.

The clean slate theory was thus the result of many historical trends !!,
and had received favour at one time or another from both emerging and
established nations.

(b) Theoretical Bases of the Clean Slate Principle


sovereign over the territory. To the succeeding State, the treaties
concluded by the former State are res inter alios acta.” '?

Basic concepts of State sovereignty also require that any curtailment of
the sovereign authority of a State requires the express consent of the
State.

If there is to be, in a given case, a deviation from the clean slate prin-
ciple, sufficiently cogent reasons should exist to demonstrate that the new
State’s sovereignty is not being thereby impaired. The question needs
therefore to be examined as to whether there is any impairment of State
sovereignty implicit in the application of the principle of automatic suc-
cession to any given treaty.

(c) Necessary Exceptions to the Clean Slate Principle

Human rights and humanitarian treaties involve no loss of sovereignty
or autonomy of the new State, but are merely in line with general prin-
ciples of protection that flow from the inherent dignity of every human
being which is the very foundation of the United Nations Charter.

At the same time, it is important that the circle of exceptions should
not be too widely drawn. Conceivably some human rights treaties may
involve economic burdens, such as treaties at the economic end of the
spectrum of human rights. It is beyond the scope of this opinion to exam-
ine whether all human rights and humanitarian treaties should be
exempted from the clean slate principle. It is sufficient for the purposes of
this opinion to note a variety of reasons why it has been contended that
human rights and humanitarian treaties in general attract the principle of
automatic succession. These reasons apply with special force to treaties
such as the Genocide Convention or the Convention against Torture,
leaving no room for doubt regarding automatic succession to such trea-
ties. The international community has a special interest in the continuity
of such treaties.

REASONS FAVOURING VIEW OF AUTOMATIC SUCCESSION
TO THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION

1. It Is Not Centred on Individual State Interests

This Court, in its earlier consideration of the Genocide Convention,
drew pointed attention to the difference between a humanitarian treaty

12 E. Castrén, “Obligations of States Arising from the Dismemberment of Another
State”, Zeitschrift für ausländisches ôffentliches Recht und Vôlkerrecht, 1950-1951,
Vol. 13, p. 754 (emphasis added); cited by M. G. Maloney in Virginia Journal of Inter-
national Law, 1979-1980, Vol. 19, p. 892.



such as the Genocide Convention, and a convention aimed at protecting
the interests of a State. The Court stated in its Opinion on Reservations

Genocide that:

“In such a convention the contracting States do not have any
interests of their own; they merely have, one and all, a common
interest, namely, the accomplishment of those high purposes which
are the raison d’être of the convention. Consequently, in a conven-
tion of this type one cannot speak of individual advantages or dis-
advantages to States, or of the maintenance of a perfect contractual
balance between rights and duties.” (I. C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23.)

Charles De Visscher has remarked on the contrast

“between the frailty of agreements of merely individual interest,
dependent as these are upon transitory political relations, and the
relative stability of conventions dictated by concern for order or


He has also remarked in this context that the growing part played by
multilateral treaties in the development of international law should count

tions they create 4.

Human rights and humanitarian treaties do not represent an exchange
of interests and benefits between contracting States in the conventional
sense, and in this respect may also be distinguished from the generality of

security or other interests of States. Human rights and humanitarian
treaties represent, rather, a commitment of the participating States to cer-
tain norms and values recognized by the international community.

Stated another way, the personality of the sovereign is not the essence
of such an agreement. Multilateral treaties are most often concluded with
the object of protecting and benefiting the international community as a
whole, and for the maintenance of world order and co-operation, rather
than of protecting and advancing one particular State’s interests.

2. It Transcends Concepts of State Sovereignty

The Genocide Convention does not come to an end with the dismem-

ereignty. An important conceptual basis denying continuity to treaties is
that the recognition of the continuity of the predecessor State’s treaties
would be an intrusion upon the sovereignty of the successor State. This-

would be so if it were a matter confined within the ambit of a State’s sov-
ereignty. But with human rights and humanitarian treaties, we are in a
sphere which reaches far beyond the narrow confines of State sover-
eignty, and enters the domain of universal concern.

In its ongoing development, the concept of human rights has long
passed the stage when it was a narrow parochial concern between sov-
ereign and subject. We have reached the stage, today, at which the
human rights of anyone, anywhere, are the concern of everyone, every-
where. The world’s most powerful States are bound to recognize them,

derogation of sovereignty.

3. The Rights It Recognizes Impose No Burden on the State

away any of its rights to its subjects. It does not burden itself with any
new liability. It merely confirms its subjects in the enjoyment of those
rights which are theirs by virtue of their humanity. Human rights are
never a gift from the State and hence the State, in recognizing them, is
not imposing any burden upon itself. We have long passed the historical

was then considered to be a part of his absolute and undoubted rights as
a sovereign. Human rights treaties are no more than a formal recognition
by the sovereign of rights which already belong to each of that sover-
eign’s subjects. Far from being largesse extended to them by their sov-


Quite contrary to the view that human rights treaties are a burden on
the new State, it could indeed be asserted that the adherence by a new
State to a system which is universally accepted, whereby the new State
becomes part of that system, is indeed a benefit to the new State, in sharp

tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, “the principles underlying
the [Genocide] Convention are principles which are recognized by civi-
lized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obliga-
tion” (I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23). The same may be said of all treaties
concerning basic human rights.



The Court referred also in the same Opinion to the universal character
of the condemnation of genocide. This condemnation has its roots in the
convictions of humanity, of which the legal rule is only a reflection. The

rights and humanitarian law.

5. It Embodies Rules of Customary International Law

The human rights and humanitarian principles contained in the Geno-

principles continue to be applicable to both sovereign and subjects, irre-
spective of changes in sovereignty, for the new sovereign, equally with the
old, is subject to customary international law. The customary rights
which the subjects of that State enjoy continue to be enjoyed by them,
whoever may be their sovereign. The correlative duties attach to the

customary rights are also embodied in a treaty.

This factor may indeed be seen in wider context as essential to the evo-
lution of international law into a universal system. Among writers who
have stressed this aspect in relation to multilateral treaties are Wilfred


“It is generally admitted that a new State is bound by existing
rules of customary international law. This principle has, indeed,
been of fundamental importance in the development of international
law into a world-wide system . . . It is not clear why, now that the

large a part of the operative law of nations, a new State should be
regarded as starting with a clean slate in respect of rules which have
a conventional rather than a customary origin.” !*

In regard to such a matter as genocide, there can be no doubt that the

before themselves “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war”.

Genocide attacks these concepts at their very root and, by so doing,
strikes at the foundations of international stability and security.

A State’s guarantees of human rights to its subjects in terms of even
such a Covenant as the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights are thus a matter which does not concern that State alone, but
represent a contribution to human dignity and global stability — as dis-
tinguished, for example, from a commercial or trading treaty. This aspect

At the United Nations Conference on State Succession on 22 April
1977, the Soviet Union drew attention to a letter by the International
Committee of the Red Cross to the Chairman of the International Law

from any obligation under the Geneva Conventions. In this connection,
the representative of the Soviet Union observed that, “Such a practice
had not created difficulties for newly independent States”! He also
observed :

tance for the whole international community, and particularly for
newly independent States. It was therefore in the interests of not
only newly independent States but also of the international commu-
nity as a whole that a treaty of universal character should not cease
to be in force when a new State attained independence.” !”

7. The Undesirability of a Hiatus in Succession to the Genocide

cession to human rights and humanitarian treaties, the strange situation

in the development of human rights.

Jenks observes, “It is not a matter of perpetuating the dead hand of the
past, but of avoiding a legal vacuum.” !® This vacuum could exist over
“hundreds of thousands of square miles and millions of citizens . . .”


“the uncertainty, confusion and practical inconvenience of a legal
vacuum which may be gravely prejudicial not only to the interests of
other States concerned but equally to the interests of the new State
itself and its citizens” 2°.

The undesirability of such a result becomes more evident still if the
human rights treaty under consideration is one as fundamental as the
Genocide Convention. If the principle set out earlier is not clearly recog-
nized, the international legal system would be endorsing the curious
result that people living under guarantees that genocide will not be com-

at the time they need it most — when there is instability in their State.
The anomaly of a grant followed by a withdrawal of the benefits, of such
a Covenant as the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights,
becomes compounded in the case of the Genocide Convention, and the
result is one which, in my view, international law does not recognize or


Furthermore, there may be circumstances where, after a new State has
proclaimed its independence, the accession of that State to statehood
may itself be delayed by the non-recognition of a breakaway State by the
State from which it breaks away. In such a situation, where advent of the

State, there can be no accession to the treaty by the breakaway State for
a considerable time. During that period, it seems unreasonable that the
citizens of that breakaway State should be deprived of such protection as
the Convention may give them, against acts of genocide by the State
from which the secession has occurred, as well as by the State that has

seems to me to be totally inconsistent with contemporary international
law — more especially in regard to a treaty protecting such universally
recognized rights as the Genocide Convention.

Genocide during Periods of Transition

To the strong conceptual position resulting from the foregoing consid-
erations, there must be added the practical imperatives that result from

dismemberment of a State, with all the political, social and military turmoil
that is known only too well to accompany that process in modern times.

It would in fact be most dangerous to view the break-up of a State as
clearing the decks of the human rights treaties and obligations of the

and that is why I have felt impelled to state my opinion upon this all-
important matter.

All around us at the present time, the break-up of States has often been
accompanied by atrocities of the most brutal and inhuman kind, prac-

tinuity of the law or any vagueness in the perception of that continuity
would be fraught with danger to the most cherished values of civilization.

If the principle of continuity in relation to succession of States, adopted
in Article 34 (1) in the 1978 Vienna Convention on Succession of States

Convention must surely be among such treaties.

Furthermore, humanitarian treaties formulate principles that are an
established part of the law of war. The law of war applies, of course, even
in regard to an internal war (vide Geneva Convention 1977, Protocol II).

the Genocide Convention may also be reckoned, becomes particularly
important in times of internal turmoil. Such treaties cannot be suspended
sine die during times of internal unrest such as accompany the break-up
of a State, when they are most needed.

in the Sense Which Attracts the Res Inter Alios Acta Principle

The beneficiaries of the Genocide Convention, as indeed of all human
rights treaties, are not strangers to the State which recognizes the rights
referred to in the Convention. The principle that res inter alios acta are

apply to such conventions. There is no vesting of rights in extraneous
third parties or in other States, and no obligation on the part of the State
to recognize any rights of an external nature. Far from being a trans-
action inter alios, such treaties promote the highest internal interests
which any State can aspire to protect.

10. The Rights Conferred by the Convention Are Non-derogable

The rights and obligations guaranteed by the Genocide Convention are
non-derogable, for they relate to the right to life, the most fundamental


of human rights, and an integral part of the irreducible core of human
rights. It relates not merely to the right to life of one individual, but to
that right en masse.

not merely to refrain from committing genocide, but to prevent and pun-
ish acts of genocide. The failure by a successor régime to assume and dis-
charge this obligation would be altogether incompatible with State obli-
gations as recognized in contemporary international law.

of the present matter, is the analogy between a treaty vesting human
rights, and a dispositive treaty vesting property rights. From the time of
Vattel?!, such a dispositive treaty, as for example a treaty recognizing a
servitude, has been looked upon as vesting rights irrevocably in the party
to whom they were granted; and those rights, once vested, could not be

become vested in the persons enjoying them in a manner comparable, in
their irrevocable character, to vested rights in a dispositive treaty.

This interesting legal hypothesis need not detain us here as the conclu-
sion I have reached is amply supported by the other principles discussed.

Some of the reasons set out above, even considered individually, are
cogent enough to demonstrate the applicability of automatic succession
to the Genocide Convention (and indeed to a wide range of human rights
and humanitarian treaties). Taken cumulatively, they point strongly to
the clear incompatibility with international law of the contention that the

human rights protections. Such a view would grievously tear the seamless
fabric of international human rights protections, endanger peace, and
