“Senegal may reject the Court’s competence in respect of:

— Disputes in regard to which the parties have agreed to have
recourse to some other method of settlement ;


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 62

— Disputes with regard to questions which, under international law,
fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of Senegal.”

That declaration was also expressed as being applicable solely to “all legal
disputes arising after the present declaration . . .”

23. Senegal observed that if Guinea-Bissau were to challenge the deci-
sion of the Arbitration Tribunal on the merits, it would be raising a ques-
tion excluded from the Court’s jurisdiction by the terms of Senegal’s
declaration. According to Senegal, the dispute concerning the maritime
delimitation was the subject of the Arbitration Agreement of 12 March
1985 and consequently fell into the category of disputes “in regard to
which the parties have agreed to have recourse to some other method of
settlement”. Furthermore, in the view of Senegal, that dispute arose
before 2 December 1985, the date on which Senegal’s acceptance of the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court became effective, and is thus
excluded from the category of disputes “arising after” that declaration.

24. However, the Parties were agreed that there was a distinction
between the substantive dispute relating to maritime delimitation, and the
dispute relating to the Award rendered by the Arbitration Tribunal, and
that only the latter dispute, which arose after the Senegalese declaration, is
the subject of the present proceedings before the Court. Guinea-Bissau
also took the position, which Senegal accepted, that these proceedings
were not intended by way of appeal from the Award or as an application
for revision of it. Thus, both Parties recognize that no aspect of the sub-
stantive delimitation dispute is involved. On this basis, Senegal did not
dispute that the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Application under
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute. In the circumstances of the case the
Court regards its jurisdiction as established.

25. In this respect the Court would emphasize that, as the Parties were
both agreed, these proceedings allege the inexistence and nullity of the
Award rendered by the Arbitration Tribunal and are not by way of appeal
from it or application for revision of it. As the Court had occasion to
observe with respect to the contention of nullity advanced in the case of
the Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906:

“the Award is not subject to appeal and . . . the Court cannot
approach the consideration of the objections raised by Nicaragua to
the validity of the Award as a Court of Appeal. The Court is not
called upon to pronounce on whether the arbitrator’s decision was
right or wrong. These and cognate considerations have no relevance
to the function that the Court is called upon to discharge in these
proceedings, which is to decide whether the Award is proved to be a
nullity having no effect.” (1.C.J. Reports 1960, p. 214.)


26. The Court will now consider a contention by Senegal that Guinea-
Bissau’s Application is inadmissible, insofar as it seeks to use the declara-
tion of President Barberis for the purpose of casting doubt on the validity
of the Award (see paragraph 30 below). Senegal argues that that declara-
tion is not part of the Award, and therefore that any attempt by Guinea-
Bissau to make use of it for that purpose “must be regarded as an abuse of
process aimed at depriving Senegal of the rights belonging to it under the
Award”. Senegal also contends that the remedies sought are dispropor-
tionate to the grounds invoked and that the proceedings have been
brought for the purpose of delaying the final solution of the dispute.

27. The Court considers that Guinea-Bissau’s Application has been
properly presented in the framework of its right to have recourse to the
Court in the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, it does not accept
Senegal’s contention that Guinea-Bissau’s Application, or the arguments
used in support of it, amount to an abuse of process.


30. The Court will now examine the submissions of Guinea-Bissau that
the Arbitral Award is inexistent, or subsidiarily that it is absolutely null
and void. In support of its principal contention, that the Award is inexis-


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 64

tent, the Applicant claims that the Award was not supported by a real
majority. Guinea-Bissau does not dispute the fact that the Award was
expressed to have been adopted by the votes of President Barberis and
Mr. Gros; it contends however that President Barberis’s declaration con-
tradicted and invalidated his vote, thus leaving the Award unsupported by
a real majority. The Tribunal, having concluded, in reply to the first ques-
tion in the Arbitration Agreement, that the 1960 Agreement “has the force
of law in the relations between” the Parties, held that that was so “with
regard solely to the areas mentioned in that Agreement, namely, the terri-
torial sea, the contiguous zone and the continental shelf . . .” (Award,
para. 88). However, Guinea-Bissau drew attention to the fact that, in his
declaration, President Barberis stated that he would have replied to the
effect that the Agreement had the force of law in the relations between the
Parties “with respect to the territorial sea, the contiguous zone and the
continental shelf, but does not have the force of law with respect to the
waters of the exclusive economic zone or the fishery zone . . .” (para-
graph 19 above).

31. The Court considers that, in putting forward this formulation, what
President Barberis had in mind was that the Tribunal’s answer to the first
question “could have been more precise” — to use his own words —, not
that it had to be more precise in the sense indicated in his formulation,
which was, in his view, a preferable one, not a necessary one. In the opin-
ion of the Court, the formulation discloses no contradiction with that of
the Award.

32. Guinea-Bissau also drew attention to the fact that President Bar-
beris expressed the view that his own formulation “would have enabled
the Tribunal to deal in its Award with the second question put by the Arbi-
tration Agreement” and that the Tribunal would in consequence “have
been competent to delimit the waters of the exclusive economic zone or
the fishery zone between the two countries”, in addition to the other areas.
The Court considers that the view expressed by President Barberis, that
the reply which he would have given to the first question would have
enabled the Tribunal to deal with the second question, represented, not a
position taken by him as to what the Tribunal was required to do, but only
an indication of what he considered would have been a better course. His
position therefore could not be regarded as standing in contradiction with
the position adopted by the Award.

33. Furthermore, even if there had been any contradiction, for either of
the two reasons relied on by Guinea-Bissau, between the view expressed
by President Barberis and that stated in the Award, such contradiction
could not prevail over the position which President Barberis had taken
when voting for the Award. In agreeing to the Award, he definitively
agreed to the decisions, which it incorporated, as to the extent of the mari-
time areas governed by the 1960 Agreement, and as to the Tribunal not
being required to answer the second question in view of its answer to the
first. As the practice of international tribunals shows, it sometimes hap-
pens that a member of a tribunal votes in favour of a decision of the tribu-


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 65

nal even though he might individually have been inclined to prefer
another solution. The validity of his vote remains unaffected by the
expression of any such differences in a declaration or separate opinion of
the member concerned, which are therefore without consequence for the
decision of the tribunal.

34. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Court, the contention of Guinea-
Bissau that the Award was inexistent for lack of a real majority cannot be
accepted.

35. Subsidiarily, Guinea-Bissau maintains that the Award is, as a
whole, null and void, on the grounds of excès de pouvoir and of insuffi-
ciency of reasoning. Guinea-Bissau observes that the Tribunal did not
reply to the second question put in Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement,
and did not append to the Award the map provided for in Article 9 of that
Agreement. It is contended that these two omissions constitute an excés de
pouvoir. Furthermore, no reasons, it is said, were given by the Tribunal for
its decision not to proceed to the second question, for not producing a
single delimitation line, and for refusing to draw that line on a map.

36. The Court will examine Guinea-Bissau’s contentions, whether
presented as of excès de pouvoir or as lack of reasoning, which are based
on the absence of a reply to the second question put by the Arbitration
Agreement, before dealing with those relating to the absence of a map.

xk

37. On this first point, the Court would, for convenience, recall at the
outset that, according to Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement:

“The Tribunal is requested to decide in accordance with the norms
of international law on the following questions:

1. Does the Agreement concluded by an exchange of letters on
26 April 1960, and which relates to the maritime boundary, have the
force of law in the relations between the Republic of Guinea-Bissau
and the Republic of Senegal ?

2. Inthe event of a negative answer to the first question, what is the
course of the line delimiting the maritime territories appertaining to
the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Senegal respec-
tively ?”

38. The Award, after dealing with some preliminary matters, analyses
the grounds upon which Guinea-Bissau based its assertions that the 1960
Agreement did not have the force of law in its relations with Senegal
(paras. 35-79). The conclusion in paragraph 80 of the Award is that “the


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 66

1960 Agreement is valid and can be opposed to Senegal and to Guinea-
Bissau”. The Award then deals, in paragraphs 80 to 86, with “the scope of
substantive validity of the 1960 Agreement” and states that:

“the 1960 Agreement does not delimit those maritime spaces which
did not exist at that date, whether they be termed exclusive economic
zone, fishery zone or whatever.

On the other hand, the position regarding the territorial sea, the
contiguous zone and the continental shelf is quite different. These

three concepts are expressly mentioned in the 1960 Agreement and
they existed at the time of its conclusion.”

The Award goes on to say that, for the reasons explained in the passage
quoted in paragraph 16 above,

“the Franco-Portuguese Agreement delimits the continental shelf
between the Parties over the whole extent of that maritime space as
defined at present”.

Then the Award continues, in paragraph 87:

“Bearing in mind the above conclusions reached by the Tribunal
and the actual wording of Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement, in
the opinion of the Tribunal it is not called upon to reply to the second
question.”

Finally, paragraph 88 of the Award declares in its first sentence that:

“For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides by two votes to
one:

To reply as follows to the first question formulated in Article 2 of
the Arbitration Agreement: The Agreement concluded by an
exchange of letters on 26 April 1960, and relating to the maritime
boundary, has the force of law in the relations between the Republic
of Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Senegal with regard solely to
the areas mentioned in that Agreement, namely the territorial sea, the
contiguous zone and the continental shelf.”

39. Guinea-Bissau’s complaint on the ground that the Tribunal did not
give an answer to the second question in Article 2 of the Arbitration
Agreement involves three arguments. It questions whether the Tribunal
really took a decision not to give an answer; it contends that, even if there
was such a decision, there was insufficient reasoning in support of it; and,
finally, it contests the validity of any such decision.

40. Astothe first of these three arguments, Guinea-Bissau suggests that
what the Tribunal did was not to decide not to answer the second question


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 67

puttoit;itsimply omitted, for lack of a real majority, to reach any decision
at all on the issue. In this respect Guinea-Bissau stresses that what is
referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 87 of the Award as an “opin-
ion of the Tribunal” on the point appears in the statement of reasoning,
not in the operative clause of the Award; that the Award does not specify
the majority by which that paragraph would have been adopted; and that
only Mr. Gros could have voted in favour of this paragraph. In the light of
the declaration made by President Barberis, Guinea-Bissau questions
whether any vote was taken on paragraph 87.

41. The Court recognizes that the structure of the Award is, in that
respect, open to criticism. Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement put two
questions to the Tribunal; and the Tribunal was, according to Article 9, to
“inform the two Governments of its decision regarding the questions set
forthin Article 2”. Consequently, it would have been normal to include in
the operative part of the Award, i.e., in a final paragraph, both the answer
given to the first question and the decision not to answer the second. It is to
be regretted that this course was not followed. However, when the Tribu-
nal adopted the Award by two votes to one, it was not only approving the
content of paragraph 88, but was also doing so for the reasons already
stated inthe Award and, in particular, in paragraph 87. It is clear from that
paragraph, taken in its context, and also from the declaration of Presi-
dent Barberis, that the Tribunal decided by two votes to one that, as it had
given an affirmative answer to the first question, it did not have to answer
the second. By so doing, the Tribunal did take a decision: namely, not
to answer the second question put to it. The Award is not flawed by any
failure to decide.

*

42. Guinea-Bissau argues, secondly, that any arbitral award must, in
accordance with general international law, be a reasoned one. Moreover,
according to Article 9, paragraph 3, of the Arbitration Agreement, the
Parties had specifically agreed that “the Award shall state in full the rea-
sons on which it is based”. Yet, according to Guinea-Bissau, the Tribunal
in this case did not give any reasoning in support of its refusal to reply to
the second question put by the Parties or, at the very least, gave “wholly
insufficient” reasoning, which did not even make it possible to “determine
the line of argument followed” and did not “reply on any point to the
questions raised and discussed during the arbitral proceedings”. On this
ground also, it is claimed that the Award is null and void.

43. In paragraph 87 of the Award, referred to above, the Tribunal,
“bearing in mind the . . . conclusions” that it had reached, together with
“the wording of Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement”, took the view
that it was not called upon to reply to the second question put to it. This
reasoning is brief, and could doubtless have been developed further. But
the references in paragraph 87 to the Tribunal’s conclusions and to the


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 68

wording of Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement make it possible to
determine, without difficulty, the reasons why the Tribunal decided not to
answer the second question. By referring to the wording of Article 2 of the
Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal was taking note that, according to
that Article, it was asked, first, whether the 1960 Agreement had “the force
of law in the relations” between Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, and then, “in
the event of a negative answer to the first question, what is the course of
the line delimiting the maritime territories” of the two countries. By refer-
ring to the conclusions that it had already reached, the Tribunal was
noting that it had, in paragraphs 80 ef seq. of the Award, found that the
1960 Agreement, in respect of which it had already determined the scope
of its substantive validity, was “valid and can be opposed to Senegal
and to Guinea-Bissau”. Having given an affirmative answer to the first
question, and basing itself on the actual text of the Arbitration Agreement,
the Tribunal found as a consequence that it did not have to reply to the
second question. That statement of reasoning, while succinct, is clear and
precise. The second contention of Guinea-Bissau must also be dismissed.

44. Thirdly, Guinea-Bissau challenges the validity of the reasoning
thus adopted by the Tribunal on the issue whether it was required to
answer the second question. In this respect Guinea-Bissau presents two
arguments: first that the Arbitration Agreement, on its true construction,
required an answer to the second question whatever might have been its
reply to the first; secondly, that in any event an answer to the second
question was required because the answer to the first question was in fact
partially negative.

45. Guinea-Bissau’s first argument is that the Arbitration Agreement
was concluded on the basis of an agreement

“that a two-fold question should be posed to the Tribunal, in order to
ensure that whatever [the Tribunal’s] reply concerning the value of
the Franco-Portuguese exchange of letters, the Tribunal would be
called upon to proceed to a comprehensive delimitation of the mari-
time territories”.

In the view of Guinea-Bissau, even if the Tribunal upheld the validity and
opposability of the 1960 Agreement, the effect would not be to produce a
complete delimitation, and a complete delimitation by a single line was the
object and purpose of the Arbitration Agreement. Accordingly, Guinea-
Bissau is in effect contending that that Agreement required the Tribunal
to answer the second question whatever was its answer to the first.

46. In this connection the Court would first recall

“a rule consistently accepted by general international law in the mat-
ter of international arbitration. Since the Alabama case, it has been
generally recognized, following the earlier precedents, that, in the


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 69

absence of any agreement to the contrary, an international tribunal
has the right to decide as to its own jurisdiction and has the power to
interpret for this purpose the instruments which govern that jurisdic-
tion.” (Nottebohm, Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
1953, p. 119.)

In the present case, Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Arbitration Agreement
confirmed that the Tribunal had the power to determine its own jurisdic-
tion and to interpret the Agreement for that purpose.

47. By its argument set out above, Guinea-Bissau is in fact criticizing
the interpretation in the Award of the provisions of the Arbitration Agree-
ment which determine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and proposing another
interpretation. However, the Court does not have to enquire whether or
not the Arbitration Agreement could, with regard to the Tribunal’s
competence, be interpreted in a number of ways, and if so to consider
which would have been preferable. By proceeding in that way the Court
would be treating the request as an appeal and not as a recours en nullité.
The Court could not act in that way in the present case. It has simply to
ascertain whether by rendering the disputed Award the Tribunal acted in
manifest breach of the competence conferred on it by the Arbitration
Agreement, either by deciding in excess of, or by failing to exercise, its
jurisdiction.

48. Such manifest breach might result from, for example, the failure of
the Tribunal properly to apply the relevant rules of interpretation to the
provisions of the Arbitration Agreement which govern its competence. An
arbitration agreement (compromis d'arbitrage) is an agreement between
States which must be interpreted in accordance with the general rules of
international law governing the interpretation of treaties. In that respect

“the first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and
apply the provisions of a treaty, is to endeavour to give effect to them
in their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they
occur. If the relevant words in their natural and ordinary meaning
make sense in their context, that is an end of the matter. If, on the
other hand, the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are
ambiguous or lead to an unreasonable result, then, and then only,
must the Court, by resort to other methods of interpretation, seek to
ascertain what the parties really did mean when they used these
words.” (Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a
State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, 1.C.J. Reports 1950,

p. 8.)

The rule of interpretation according to the natural and ordinary meaning
of the words employed

“is not an absolute one. Where such a method of interpretation
results in a meaning incompatible with the spirit, purpose and con-
text of the clause or instrument in which the words are contained, no


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 70

reliance can be validly placed on it.” (South West Africa, Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 336.)

These principles are reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Conven-
tion on the Law of Treaties, which may in many respects be considered as
a codification of existing customary international law on the point.

49. Furthermore, when States sign an arbitration agreement, they are
concluding an agreement with a very specific object and purpose: to
entrust an arbitration tribunal with the task of settling a dispute in accord-
ance with the terms agreed by the parties, who define in the agreement the
jurisdiction of the tribunal and determine its limits. In the performance of
the task entrusted to it, the tribunal “must conform to the terms by which
the Parties have defined this task” ( Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary
in the Gulf of Maine Area, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 266, para. 23).

50. In the present case, Article 2 of the Arbitration Agreement pre-
sented a first question concerning the 1960 Agreement, and then a second
question relating to delimitation. A reply had to be given to the second
question “in the event of a negative answer to the first question”. The
Court notes that those last words, which were originally proposed by
Guinea-Bissau itself, are categorical. The situation in the present case dif-
fers from that faced by the Court or by arbitral tribunals when they had
to reply to successive questions which were not made conditional on each
other, and to each of which some meaning had in any event to be attri-
buted in order for a reply to be given thereto, as for example in the case of
the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex (Order of 19 August
1929, P.C.1J., Series A, No. 22, p. 13), or Corfu Channel, Merits (Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 24). Where, however, successive questions were put
to the Court which were made conditional on each other, the Court
replied, or found no room to reply, according to whether or not the gov-
erning condition had been fulfilled, as, for example, in Interpretation of
the Greco-Bulgarian Agreement of 9 December 1927 (Advisory Opinion,
1932, P.CIJ., Series A/B, No. 45, pp. 70, 86-87); and Interpretation of
Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (First Phase, Advisory
Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, pp. 65, 67-68, 75, 76, 77; Second Phase, Advi-
sory Opinion, ibid., pp. 225, 226, 230).

51. In fact in the present case the Parties could have used some such
expression as that the Tribunal should answer the second question “tak-
ing into account” the reply given to the first, but they did not; they directed
that the second question should be answered only “in the event of a nega-
tive answer” to that first question. In that respect, the wording was very
different from that to be found in another Arbitration Agreement to which
Guinea-Bissau is a party, that concluded on 18 February 1983 with the
Republic of Guinea. By that Agreement, those two States asked another
tribunal to decide on the legal value and scope of another Franco-Portu-
guese delimitation convention and annexed documents, and then,


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 71

“according to the answers given” to those initial questions, to determine
the “course of the boundary between the maritime territories” of the two
countries.

52. Faced with the problem presented by the prefatory words of the
second question, the Applicant stresses that, according to the Preamble
of the Arbitration Agreement, its object was to settle the dispute that had
arisen between the two countries relating to the determination of their
maritime boundary. The first sentence of Article 2 requested the Tribunal
to decide on the two questions put to it. The Tribunal was, according to
Article 9, to “inform the two Governments of its decision regarding the
questions set forth in Article 2”. That decision was to “include the drawing
of the boundary line on a map”. According to Guinea-Bissau, the Tribu-
nal was therefore required to delimit by a single line the whole of the mari-
time areas appertaining to each State. As, for the reasons given by the
Tribunal, its answer to the first question put in the Arbitration Agreement
could not lead to a comprehensive delimitation, it followed, in Guinea-
Bissau’s view, that, notwithstanding the prefatory words to the second
question the Tribunal was required to answer that question and to effect
the overall delimitation desired by both Parties.

53. Itisusefulto recall, in order to assess the weight of that line of argu-
ment, the circumstances in which the Arbitration Agreement was drawn
up. Following various incidents, Senegal and Guinea-Bissau engaged in
negotiations, from 1977 to 1985, with regard to their maritime boundary.
Two opposing views were asserted. Senegal maintained that the Agree-
ment concluded in 1960 between France, on its own behalf and that of the
Communauté, and Portugal had the force of law in the relations between
the two States, by virtue of the rules relating to State succession, and that
the line defined by that Agreement defined the boundary. Guinea-Bissau
however considered that that Agreement was inexistent, null and void,
and in any case not opposable to it. From this it inferred that it would be
appropriate to proceed ex novo to a maritime delimitation between the
two States. When the time came to draft the Arbitration Agreement, Sen-
egal proposed that the Tribunal should decide solely whether the 1960
Agreement had the force of law in the relations between the Parties.
Guinea-Bissau asked that the Tribunal should be entrusted only with the
task of drawing the line delimiting the maritime territories in dispute.
After lengthy discussions, it was agreed that there should first be put to the
Tribunal the question proposed by Senegal. Guinea-Bissau suggested in
addition that, “in the event of a negative answer to the first question”,
the Tribunal should be asked to define the course of the delimitation
line. That form of words was ultimately adopted.

54. It will be apparent that the two questions had a completely different
subject matter. The first concerned the issue whether an international
agreement had the force of law in the relations between the Parties, while
the second was directed to a maritime delimitation in the event that that
agreement did not have such force. Senegal was counting on an affirma-
tive reply to the first question, and concluded that the straight line on a


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 72

bearing of 240°, adopted by the 1960 Agreement, would constitute the
single line separating the whole of the maritime areas of the two countries.
Guinea-Bissau was counting on a negative answer to the first question,
and concluded that a single dividing line for the whole of the maritime
areas of the two countries would be fixed ex novo by the Tribunal in reply
to the second question. The two States intended to obtain a delimitation of
the whole of their maritime areas by a single line. But Senegal was count-
ing on achieving this result through an affirmative answer to the first
question, and Guinea-Bissau through a negative answer to that question.
No agreement had been reached between the Parties as to what should
happen in the event of an affirmative answer leading only to a partial
delimitation, and as to what might be the task of the Tribunal in such case.
The travaux préparatoires accordingly confirm the ordinary meaning of
Article 2.

55. The Court considers that this conclusion is not at variance with the
circumstance that the Tribunal adopted as its title “Arbitration Tribunal
for the Determination of the Maritime Boundary: Guinea-Bissau/Sen-
egal”, or with its definition, in paragraph 27 of the Award, of the “sole
object of the dispute” as being one relating to “the determination of the
maritime boundary between the Republic of Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau, a question which they have not been able to settle by
means of negotiation . . .”. In the opinion of the Court, that title and that
definition are to be read in the light of the Tribunal’s conclusion, which
the Court shares, that, while its mandate did include the making of a deli-
mitation of all the maritime areas of the Parties, this fell to be done only
under the second question and “in the event of a negative answer to the
first question”.

56. In short, although the two States had expressed in general terms in
the Preamble of the Arbitration Agreement their desire to reach a settle-
ment of their dispute, their consent thereto had only been given in the
terms laid down by Article 2. Consequently the Tribunal did not act in
manifest breach of its competence to determine its own jurisdiction by
deciding that it was not required to answer the second question except in
the event of a negative answer to the first. The first argument must be
rejected.

57. The Court now turns to Guinea-Bissau’s second argument. Apart
from its contention that, on a true construction, the Arbitration Agree-
ment required recourse to the second question whatever was the answer to
the first, Guinea-Bissau argues that the answer in fact given by the Tribu-
nal to the first question was a partially negative answer and that this suf-
ficed to satisfy the prescribed condition for entering into the second
question. Accordingly, and as was to be shown by the declaration of Presi-
dent Barberis, the Tribunal was, it is said, both entitled and bound to
answer the second question.

58. It is true that the Arbitration Tribunal, when answering the first
question, in paragraph 88 of the Award, explained that the 1960 Agree-


ARBITRAL AWARD (JUDGMENT) 73

ment had the force of law in the relations between the Parties “with regard
solely to the areas mentioned in that Agreement, namely the territorial
sea, the contiguous zone and the continental shelf”. Consequently “the
1960 Agreement does not delimit those maritime spaces which did not
exist at that date, whether they be termed exclusive economic zone, fishery
zone or whatever” (Award, para. 85).

59. In his declaration appended to the Award reproduced in para-
graph 19 above, President Barberis added that he would have preferred
that, in paragraph 88 of the Award, an affirmative answer be given with
respect to the areas delimited by the 1960 Agreement, and a negative
answer with respect to the areas not delimited by that Agreement. In his
opinion, such a partially negative wording would have conferred on the
Tribunal a partial competence to reply to the second question, and to
determine the boundary of the waters of the exclusive economic zones or
fishery zones between the two countries.

60. The Court would first observe that the Tribunal did not, in para-
graph 88 of its Award, adopt the form of words that President Barberis
would have preferred. Guinea-Bissau thus cannot base its arguments
upon a form of words that was not in fact adopted by the Tribunal. The
Tribunal found, in reply to the first question, that the 1960 Agreement had
the force of law in the relations between the Parties, and at the same time it
defined the substantive scope of that Agreement. Such an answer did not
permit of a delimitation of the whole of the maritime areas of the two
States, and a complete settlement of the dispute between them. It achieved
a partial delimitation. But that answer was nonetheless both a complete
and an affirmative answer to the first question; it recognized that the
Agreement of 1960 had the force of law in the relations between Senegal
and Guinea-Bissau. The Tribunal could thus find, without manifest
breach of its competence, that its answer to the first question was not a
negative one, and that it was therefore not competent to answer the second
question. In this respect also, the contention of Guinea-Bissau that the
entire Award is a nullity must be rejected.

61. Finally, Guinea-Bissau recalls that, according to Article 9, para-
graph 2, of the Arbitration Agreement, the decision of the Tribunal was to
“include the drawing of the boundary line on a map”, and that no such
map was produced by the Arbitration Tribunal. Guinea-Bissau contends
that the Tribunal also did not give sufficient reasons for its decision on
that point. It is contended that the Award should, for these reasons, be
considered wholly null and void.

62. The Court observes that the Award states that the 1960 Agreement
“clearly determines the maritime boundary as regards the territorial sea,
the contiguous zone and the continental shelf” by adopting “a straight line

drawn at 240° ” (paras. 80 and 85). The Award states that this terminology
“makes it possible to rule out any geodesic line”, so that the line would
have to be a loxodromic line, which, moreover is in accordance with the
“sketch included in the preparatory work of the 1960 Agreement”
(paras. 86 and 88). Then, after deciding not to answer the second question,
the Tribunal adds that: “Furthermore, in view of its decision, the Tribunal
considered that there was no need to append a map showing the course of
the boundary line.”

63. The Court is unable to uphold the contention that the reasoning of
the Tribunal was insufficient on this point. The reasoning mentioned
above is, once again, brief but sufficient to enlighten the Parties and the
Court as to the reasons that guided the Tribunal. It found that the boun-
dary line fixed by the 1960 Agreement was a loxodromic line drawn at
240° from the point of intersection of the prolongation of the land frontier
and the low-water line of the two countries, represented for that purpose
by the Cape Roxo lighthouse. Since it did not reply to the second question,
it did not have to define any other line. It thus considered that there was no
need to draw on a map a line which was common knowledge, and the
definitive characteristics of which it had specified.

64. In view of the wording of Articles 2 and 9 of the Arbitration Agree-
ment, and the positions taken by the Parties before the Arbitration Tribu-
nal, it is open to argument whether, in the absence of a reply to the second
question, the Tribunal was under an obligation to produce the map en-
visaged by the Arbitration Agreement. The Court does not however
consider it necessary to enter into such a discussion. In the circumstances
of the case, the absence of a map cannot in any event constitute such an
irregularity as would render the Award invalid. The last argument of
Guinea-Bissau is therefore also not accepted.

be resolved as soon as possible, as both Parties desire.

69. For these reasons,
THE COURT,
(1) Unanimously,

tral Award given on 31 July 1989 by the Arbitration Tribunal established
pursuant to the Agreement of 12 March 1985 between the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Senegal, is inexistent ;

(2) By eleven votes to four,

Rejects the submission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau that the Arbi-
tral Award of 31 July 1989 is absolutely null and void;

(3) By twelve votes to three,
