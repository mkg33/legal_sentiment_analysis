tion or knowledge that they were to be used to carry out acts of terrorism
in eastern Ukraine. The Respondent also contends that the dispute does
not concern its obligations under CERD and contests allegations that it
is subjecting Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea to a
systematic campaign of racial discrimination. The Russian Federation
argues that, under cover of allegations relating to violations of the ICSFT
and CERD, Ukraine is seeking to bring before the Court disputes con-
cerning alleged violations of “diﬀerent rules of international law”. In
particular, the Respondent contends that Ukraine is seeking to seise
the Court of disputes over the Russian Federation’s alleged “overt
aggression” in eastern Ukraine and over the status of Crimea.


                                   * *
   28. As the Court has observed, applications that are submitted to it
often present a particular dispute that arises in the context of a broader
disagreement between the parties (Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2019, p. 23, para. 36; Obligation to Negotiate Access to the
Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile), Preliminary Objection, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2015 (II), p. 604, para. 32). The fact that a dispute before
the Court forms part of a complex situation that includes various mat-
ters, however important, over which the States concerned hold opposite
views, cannot lead the Court to decline to resolve that dispute, provided
that the parties have recognized its jurisdiction to do so and the condi-
tions for the exercise of its jurisdiction are otherwise met.


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                577

   29. In the present case, the Court notes that Ukraine is not requesting
that it rule on issues concerning the Russian Federation’s purported
“aggression” or its alleged “unlawful occupation” of Ukrainian territory.
Nor is the Applicant seeking a pronouncement from the Court on the
status of Crimea or on any violations of rules of international law other
than those contained in the ICSFT and CERD. These matters therefore
do not constitute the subject-matter of the dispute before the Court.

   30. The Court observes that Ukraine requests the Court to adjudge
and declare that the Russian Federation has violated a number of provi-
sions of the ICSFT and CERD, that it bears international responsibility
for those violations, and that it is required to cease such violations and
make reparation for the consequences thereof.
   31. The Court considers that it follows from the opposing views
expressed by the Parties in the present case that the dispute consists of
two aspects. First, the Parties diﬀer as to whether any rights and obliga-
tions of the Parties under the ICSFT with regard to the prevention and
suppression of the ﬁnancing of terrorism were engaged in the context of
events which occurred in eastern Ukraine starting in the spring of 2014,
and whether terrorism ﬁnancing oﬀences, within the meaning of Article 2,
paragraph 1, of the ICSFT, were committed. As a result of these diﬀer-
ences of views, the Parties draw opposite conclusions as to the alleged
breaches by the Russian Federation of its obligations under Articles 8, 9,
10, 12 and 18 of the ICSFT and as to its ensuing international responsi-
bility. Secondly, the Parties disagree as to whether the decisions or mea-
sures allegedly taken by the Russian Federation against the Crimean
Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea constitute acts of racial dis-
crimination and whether the Russian Federation bears responsibility in
that regard for the violation of its obligations under Articles 2, 4, 5, 6
and 7 of CERD.

   32. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the subject-
matter of the dispute, in so far as its ﬁrst aspect is concerned, is whether
the Russian Federation had the obligation, under the ICSFT, to take
measures and to co-operate in the prevention and suppression of the alleged
ﬁnancing of terrorism in the context of events in eastern Ukraine and, if
so, whether the Russian Federation breached such an obligation. The
subject-matter of the dispute, in so far as its second aspect is concerned,
is whether the Russian Federation breached its obligations under CERD
through discriminatory measures allegedly taken against the Crimean
Tatar and Ukrainian communities in Crimea.

  33. The Court recalls that its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the
parties and is conﬁned to the extent accepted by them (Immunities and


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                578

Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France), Preliminary Objec-
tions, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018 (I), p. 307, para. 42).
   34. To establish the Court’s jurisdiction in the present case, Ukraine
invokes Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT and Article 22 of CERD
(see paragraph 2 above). The ﬁrst of these provisions reads as follows:

       “Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the
    interpretation or application of this Convention which cannot be set-
    tled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall, at the request
    of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If, within six months from
    the date of the request for arbitration, the parties are unable to agree
    on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may
    refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice, by application,
    in conformity with the Statute of the Court.”

Article 22 of CERD provides that:
       “Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to
    the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not set-
    tled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this
    Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute,
    be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless
    the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.”

   35. Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties to the ICSFT,
which entered into force for them on 5 January 2003 and 27 December
2002 respectively. Neither of them entered any reservations to the
ICSFT.
   Ukraine and the Russian Federation are also parties to CERD. The
Convention entered into force for Ukraine on 6 April 1969. The instru-
ment of ratiﬁcation, deposited by Ukraine, on 7 March 1969, contained a
reservation to Article 22 of the Convention; on 20 April 1989, the depos-
itary received notiﬁcation that this reservation had been withdrawn. The
Russian Federation is a party to the Convention as the State continuing
the international legal personality of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics, for which CERD entered into force on 6 March 1969. The instru-
ment of ratiﬁcation, deposited by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
on 4 February 1969, contained a reservation to Article 22 of the Conven-
tion; on 8 March 1989, the depositary received notiﬁcation that this res-
ervation had been withdrawn.
   36. The Russian Federation contests the Court’s jurisdiction to enter-
tain the dispute on the basis of each of the two instruments invoked by
Ukraine. In this regard, it argues that the dispute is not one which the
Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to entertain, either under Arti-
cle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT or under Article 22 of CERD, and that
the procedural preconditions set out in these provisions were not met by


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 579

Ukraine before it seised the Court. The Respondent further contends that
Ukraine’s claims under CERD are inadmissible, since, in its view, avail-
able local remedies had not been exhausted before Ukraine ﬁled its Appli-
cation with the Court.

   37. The Court will address the preliminary objection raised by the
Russian Federation to its jurisdiction on the basis of the ICSFT in Part II
of the Judgment. It will then address, in Part III, the preliminary objec-
tions to its jurisdiction on the basis of CERD and to the admissibility of
the Application in so far as it concerns the claims made by Ukraine under
CERD.


       II. The International Convention for the Suppression
                   of the Financing of Terrorism

  39. The Court recalls that its jurisdiction ratione materiae over the dis-
pute under Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT covers “[a]ny dispute
between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or
application of this Convention”.

                                    * *
   40. The Russian Federation contests the Court’s jurisdiction ratione
materiae with regard to all aspects of the dispute submitted by Ukraine
to the Court under the ICSFT. In the Russian Federation’s opinion,
the fact that the Parties entertain diﬀerent views on the interpretation of a
treaty containing a compromissory clause is not suﬃcient to establish the
Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae. According to the Respondent,
the Court must interpret the key provisions of the relevant treaty and
“[s]atisfy itself that the facts pleaded and the evidence relied on by the
applicant State plausibly support the asserted characterisation of its
claims” as claims under that treaty. The Russian Federation does not
request from the Court a complete analysis of the facts at the stage of a
decision on preliminary objections, but contends that some consideration
must be given to the facts.
   41. The Russian Federation recalls that, in its Order of 19 April 2017
on the Request for the indication of provisional measures in the present
case, the Court aﬃrmed that Ukraine’s claimed rights under the ICSFT
were not plausible (I.C.J. Reports 2017, pp. 131-132, para. 75). In consid-
ering the plausibility of Ukraine’s case at the present stage, the Rus-


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 580

sian Federation maintains that the Court must rely on its earlier
assessment. According to the Respondent, Ukraine has not put forward
any new evidence related to elements of intention, knowledge and pur-
pose concerning the funding of acts of terrorism which would allow the
Court to depart from the ﬁndings made at the stage of its decision on
provisional measures.
   42. More speciﬁcally, the Respondent maintains that no material evi-
dence has been presented by Ukraine demonstrating that the Rus-
sian Federation provided weaponry to any entity “with the requisite
speciﬁc intent or knowledge” under Article 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT
that such weaponry would be used to shoot down ﬂight MH17. With
regard to four speciﬁc incidents of alleged indiscriminate shelling, the
Russian Federation submits that no new evidence has been presented by
Ukraine since the stage of provisional measures. In the Respondent’s
view, Ukraine fails to present any credible evidence that the perpetrators
of the shelling acted with “the requisite speciﬁc intent to kill or seriously
harm civilians” and that the locations were shelled “for the requisite spe-
ciﬁc purpose of intimidating the population or to compel a government to
do or to abstain from doing any act”. Moreover, even if a plausible case
of terrorism could be demonstrated with regard to those incidents, the
Russian Federation argues that Ukraine would also be implicated in the
commission of indiscriminate shelling during the same conﬂict. Concern-
ing the further allegation of bombing that took place in Kharkiv, the
Respondent maintains that no reliable evidence was submitted to show
that the incident was perpetrated with the Russian Federation’s support.
The Russian Federation also maintains that, in diplomatic correspon-
dence, it conﬁrmed its interest in receiving from Ukraine “the concrete
materials containing evidential data” relating to that incident, which
Ukraine failed to provide. Furthermore, with regard to other alleged acts
of extrajudicial killing, torture and ill-treatment of civilians, the Respon-
dent contends that the evidence does not demonstrate that they were
“plausible ‘terrorist’ acts within the meaning of Article 2 (1) (b) of the
ICSFT”. According to the Russian Federation, such acts have in any case
been committed by all parties to the armed conﬂict.


   43. The Russian Federation is of the view that the ICSFT is a “law
enforcement instrument” which does not cover issues of State responsibil-
ity for ﬁnancing acts of terrorism. It bases its interpretation on a textual
analysis of the Convention, as well as on considerations pertaining to the
structure of the ICSFT, the preparatory work related to the drafting of
speciﬁc articles, provisions of other conventions concerned with terrorism
and subsequent State practice. The Russian Federation asserts that mul-
tiple attempts were made by delegations during the drafting of the ICSFT
to bring public oﬃcials and State ﬁnancing within the scope of the Con-
vention, but all attempts failed.



            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                581

   44. The Russian Federation maintains that the Court must at this
stage fully interpret the relevant provisions of the ICSFT, especially Arti-
cle 2, paragraph 1. The Russian Federation submits that the term “any
person” in Article 2, paragraph 1, has to be interpreted as meaning “pri-
vate persons only” and does not cover State oﬃcials. It points out that
Ukraine is asking the Court to ﬁnd that the Russian Federation has not
prevented its own oﬃcials from ﬁnancing terrorism. In the Respondent’s
view, while State responsibility is excluded from the scope of the ICSFT,
a ﬁnding that State oﬃcials are also covered would mean declaring that
the Russian Federation is directly responsible for ﬁnancing terrorism in


   45. The Russian Federation further argues that, in order to determine
the scope of the ICSFT, the mental elements of the oﬀence of terrorism
ﬁnancing must be deﬁned. The terms “intention” and “knowledge” in
Article 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT must therefore be interpreted. The
Russian Federation maintains that these two terms are not synonymous.
It is of the view that “intention” must be understood as “a speciﬁc intent
requirement”. Following the interpretation given by the Respondent,
“knowledge” refers to actual knowledge that the funds will be used to
commit acts of terrorism, and not merely that they may be used to do so.
According to the Russian Federation, recklessness is insuﬃcient to estab-
lish knowledge. The Russian Federation accepts that the requirement of
knowledge can be satisﬁed by the ﬁnancing of groups that are notorious
terrorist organizations. However, the Respondent argues that it is not suf-
ﬁcient for Ukraine to so characterize any entity unilaterally, particularly
in the absence of any indication to that eﬀect by an international organi-
zation.


   46. The Russian Federation notes that an act constitutes an oﬀence
within the meaning of Article 2, paragraph 1 (a), of the ICSFT when it
is “an oﬀence within the scope of and as deﬁned in one of the treaties
listed in the annex” to the Convention. In this regard, the Respondent
submits that in order to constitute an oﬀence deﬁned in Article 1, para-
graph 1 (b), of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts
against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done in Montreal on 23 September
1971 (hereinafter the “Montreal Convention”), relied on by Ukraine with
regard to the downing of ﬂight MH17, there must be an intent to destroy
or cause damage to a civilian aircraft in service. The Russian Federation
also provides an interpretation of Article 2, paragraph 1 (b), of the
ICSFT, under which acts of terrorism need to be performed with a spe-
ciﬁc intention and with the purpose of intimidating a population or com-
pelling a government. According to the Respondent, intention under the


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                582

same subparagraph refers to a “subjective aim, desire or plan” and
“implicitly exclud[es] knowledge-based standards”.


                                     *
   47. Ukraine contends that the Russian Federation’s preliminary objec-
tions “improperly ask the Court to address the merits of the Parties’ dis-
pute”. In the Applicant’s view, the Court should not provide a deﬁnitive
interpretation of Article 2 of the ICSFT at the present stage of the pro-
ceedings, nor should it determine the plausibility of the alleged facts
before it, but must only decide whether the dispute is one that concerns
the interpretation or application of the ICSFT. Ukraine considers that
the Russian Federation’s contention that the Court should examine the
plausibility of the case is based “on a ﬂawed analogy between preliminary
objections and provisional measures”. It argues that the Court, in deter-
mining whether it has jurisdiction, must provisionally assume that the
facts alleged by Ukraine are true; it must therefore accept them pro tem-
pore.
   48. Despite its view that facts should not be assessed in terms of plau-
sibility at the present stage of the proceedings, Ukraine contends that it
has “more than plausibly” demonstrated that acts of terrorism within the
meaning of the ICSFT have been committed by the Russian Federation’s
“proxies” on Ukrainian territory. The Applicant argues that its Memorial
contains an “extraordinary level of evidence”.
   49. Ukraine maintains that a number of events documented by the evi-
dence presented by it establish oﬀences covered by Article 2, paragraph 1,
of the ICSFT. It asserts that Russian oﬃcials supplied the missile launch-
ing system that was used to shoot down ﬂight MH17. Ukraine argues
that this launching system was “knowingly provided” to a terrorist
organization, and that the requirement of knowledge under Article 2,
paragraph 1, was amply met. Ukraine contends that the shooting down
of the aircraft constituted a violation of the Montreal Convention and
that the supply of the launching system was an oﬀence under Article 2, para-
graph 1 (a), of the ICSFT. Moreover, Ukraine argues that its Memorial
shows that bombing attacks by the Russian Federation’s “proxies” con-
stituted oﬀences under the International Convention for the Suppression
of Terrorist Bombings and that the alleged knowledge of ﬁnancing the
attacks, including through the supply of bombs, was covered by Article 2,
paragraph 1 (a), of the ICSFT.



   50. With regard to other incidents, Ukraine argues that the evidence
presented demonstrates that certain events of indiscriminate shelling such
as those that occurred in Volnovakha and Mariupol constituted acts of
terrorism under Article 2, paragraph 1 (b), of the ICSFT because these


   51. Ukraine contends that the Russian Federation’s arguments with
regard to the interpretation of the diﬀerent elements of Article 2 of the
ICSFT belong to the merits, and that they do not have an impact on the
Court’s jurisdiction. The Applicant argues that, if the Court were now to
proceed to such interpretation, it would “prematurely determine some
elements of this dispute on the merits”. Ukraine submits that such issues
of interpretation are “inseparable from the factual questions” and in any
event do not possess an exclusively preliminary character.

   52. If however the Court were to ﬁnd it necessary to give an interpreta-
tion of Article 2 of the ICSFT at the present stage of the proceedings,
Ukraine argues that the Russian Federation’s restrictive reading should
be dismissed. The Applicant submits that Article 2, paragraph 1 (a)
and (b), of the ICSFT gives a broad and comprehensive deﬁnition of
acts of terrorism. It also maintains that the notion of “‘funds’ under Arti-
cle 1 of the ICSFT is a broad term covering all property, including weap-
ons”.
   53. In Ukraine’s view, the term “any person” in Article 2, paragraph 1,
includes both private individuals and public or government oﬃcials.
Relying on a textual interpretation of the treaty provisions, read in their
context, Ukraine contends that Article 18 imposes on States an obligation
to prevent terrorism ﬁnancing oﬀences and that, according to Article 2,
such oﬀences may be committed by “‘any person’, without qualiﬁcation”.
It maintains that concluding otherwise would be “paradoxical” as the
ICSFT would bind a State to prevent the ﬁnancing of acts of terrorism,
but would not prohibit ﬁnancing by oﬃcials of the same State. Ukraine
also argues that the Russian Federation’s interpretation undermines the
object and purpose of the ICSFT and that its own interpretation is, on
the contrary, supported by the preamble, the context and the preparatory
work of the Convention. The Applicant argues that the Russian Federa-
tion is conﬂating the States’ duty under Article 18 of the ICSFT to pre-
vent terrorism ﬁnancing with the notion of State responsibility for
committing terrorism ﬁnancing.


  54. Ukraine is of the view that providing funds to groups with the
knowledge that such groups carry out acts of terrorism is suﬃcient to
fulﬁl the requirement of knowledge under Article 2, paragraph 1, of the
ICSFT, and that certainty that the funds will be used to commit speciﬁc
acts is not required. Ukraine contends that the groups in question do not
need to be designated as terrorist by, for instance, the Security Council, a


             application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 584

competent organization or a considerable number of States, for a ﬁnanc-
ing entity to have knowledge of the terrorist groups’ activities.

   55. Ukraine also addresses the terrorism oﬀences referred to in Arti-
cle 2, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. As to the oﬀence deﬁned in Article 1,
paragraph 1 (b), of the Montreal Convention, it holds that “the civilian
or military status of the aircraft is a jurisdictional element of the oﬀence,
not subject to an intent requirement”. The Applicant also maintains that
the phrase “act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury” in Arti-
cle 2, paragraph 1 (b), of the ICSFT, does not refer to a speciﬁc mental
element; it is “an objective statement, referring to the ordinary conse-
quences of an act”. It points out that this provision further refers to the
purpose of an act of terrorism to intimidate a population or compel a
government. Ukraine states that in many cases the speciﬁc agenda of the
perpetrators of acts of terrorism will be unknown, but that in such cases
the requisite purpose can be inferred, as the provision suggests, from the
“nature or context” of the act.


                                     * *
   56. The Court will now determine whether the dispute between the
Parties is one that concerns the interpretation or the application of the
ICSFT and, therefore, whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under
Article 24, paragraph 1, of this Convention.
   57. As the Court stated in the case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic
Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Preliminary Objection,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), pp. 809-810, para. 16) and, more
recently, in the case concerning Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic
of Iran v. United States of America) (Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
I.C.J. Reports 2019, p. 23, para. 36), in order to determine the Court’s
jurisdiction ratione materiae under a compromissory clause concerning
disputes relating to the interpretation or application of a treaty, it is nec-
essary to ascertain whether the acts of which the applicant complains “fall
within the provisions” of the treaty containing the clause. This may
require the interpretation of the provisions that deﬁne the scope of the
treaty. In the present case, the ICSFT has to be interpreted according to
the rules contained in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (hereinafter the “Vienna Conven-
tion”), to which both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties as
of 1986.
   58. At the present stage of the proceedings, an examination by the
Court of the alleged wrongful acts or of the plausibility of the claims is
not generally warranted. The Court’s task, as reﬂected in Article 79 of the
Rules of Court of 14 April 1978 as amended on 1 February 2001, is to
consider the questions of law and fact that are relevant to the objection to
its jurisdiction.


             application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                  585

   59. The ICSFT imposes obligations on States parties with respect to
oﬀences committed by a person when “that person by any means, directly
or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the
intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be
used, in full or in part, in order to carry out” acts of terrorism as described
in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) and (b). As stated in the preamble, the pur-
pose of the Convention is to adopt “eﬀective measures for the prevention
of the ﬁnancing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the
prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators”. The ICSFT addresses
oﬀences committed by individuals. In particular, Article 4 requires each
State party to the Convention to establish the oﬀences set forth in Arti-
cle 2 as criminal oﬀences under its domestic law and to make those
oﬀences punishable by appropriate penalties. The ﬁnancing by a State of
acts of terrorism is not addressed by the ICSFT. It lies outside the scope
of the Convention. This is conﬁrmed by the preparatory work of the Con-
vention, which indicates that proposals to include ﬁnancing by States of
acts of terrorism were put forward but were not adopted (United Nations,
docs. A/C.6/54/SR.32-35 and 37). As was recalled in the report of the
Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly which contrib-
uted to the drafting of the ICSFT, some delegations even proposed to
exclude all matters of State responsibility from the scope of the Conven-
tion (United Nations doc. A/54/37). However, it has never been contested
that if a State commits a breach of its obligations under the ICSFT, its
responsibility would be engaged.

   60. The conclusion that the ﬁnancing by a State of acts of terrorism
lies outside the scope of the ICSFT does not mean that it is lawful under
international law. The Court recalls that, in resolution 1373 (2001), the
United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Char-
ter, decided that all States shall “[r]efrain from providing any form of
support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist
acts”.
   61. When deﬁning the perpetrators of oﬀences of ﬁnancing acts of ter-
rorism, Article 2 of the ICSFT refers to “any person”. According to its
ordinary meaning, this term covers individuals comprehensively. The
Convention contains no exclusion of any category of persons. It applies
both to persons who are acting in a private capacity and to those who are
State agents. As the Court noted (see paragraph 59 above), State ﬁnanc-
ing of acts of terrorism is outside the scope of the ICSFT; therefore, the
commission by a State oﬃcial of an oﬀence described in Article 2 does
not in itself engage the responsibility of the State concerned under the
Convention. However, all States parties to the ICSFT are under an obli-
gation to take appropriate measures and to co-operate in the prevention
and suppression of oﬀences of ﬁnancing acts of terrorism committed by
whichever person. Should a State breach such an obligation, its responsi-
bility under the Convention would arise.



            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)               586

   62. As the title of the ICSFT indicates, the Convention speciﬁcally
concerns the support given to acts of terrorism by ﬁnancing them. Arti-
cle 2, paragraph 1, refers to the provision or collection of “funds”. This
term is deﬁned in Article 1, paragraph 1, as meaning:
    “assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or
    immovable, however acquired, and legal documents or instruments
    in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to, or
    interest in, such assets, including, but not limited to, bank credits,
    travellers cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities,
    bonds, drafts, letters of credit”.


This deﬁnition covers many kinds of ﬁnancial instruments and includes
also other assets. Since no speciﬁc objection to the Court’s jurisdiction
was made by the Russian Federation with regard to the scope of the term
“funds” and in particular to the reference in Ukraine’s submissions to the
provision of weapons, this issue relating to the scope of the ICSFT need
not be addressed at the present stage of the proceedings. However, the
interpretation of the deﬁnition of “funds” could be relevant, as appropri-
ate, at the stage of an examination of the merits.
   63. An element of an oﬀence under Article 2, paragraph 1, of the
ICSFT is that the person concerned has provided funds “with the inten-
tion that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be
used” to commit an act of terrorism. The existence of the requisite inten-
tion or knowledge raises complex issues of law and especially of fact that
divide the Parties and are properly a matter for the merits. The same may
be said of the question whether a speciﬁc act falls within the meaning of
Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) or (b). This question is largely of a factual
nature and is properly a matter for the merits of the case. Within the
framework of the ICSFT, questions concerning the existence of the requi-
site mental elements do not aﬀect the scope of the Convention and there-
fore are not relevant to the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae. Should
the case proceed to the examination of the merits, those questions will be
decided at that stage.
   64. In light of the above, the Court concludes that the objection raised
by the Russian Federation to its jurisdiction ratione materiae under the
ICSFT cannot be upheld.

       B. Procedural Preconditions under Article 24 of the ICSFT

   65. The Court needs now to examine whether the procedural precondi-
tions set forth in Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT (see paragraph 34
above) have been fulﬁlled. In this context, the Court will consider whether
the dispute between the Parties could not be settled through negotiation
within a reasonable time and, if so, whether the Parties were unable to


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 587

agree on the organization of an arbitration within six months from the
date of the request for arbitration.

1. Whether the dispute between the Parties could not be settled through
   negotiation
   66. The Russian Federation notes that, under Article 24, paragraph 1,
of the ICSFT, the Parties must pursue negotiations over their dispute and
that, in the event of failure, they shall try to agree on a settlement by way
of arbitration. It argues that the Court may be seised only if genuine
attempts to pursue these procedures have been made and both failed.

   67. The Russian Federation is of the view that it is not suﬃcient for
the Parties simply to enter into negotiations; these must be meaningful
and pursued “as far as possible”. The Respondent argues that “mere pro-
tests and disputations” are not suﬃcient to fulﬁl the precondition relating
to negotiation. It maintains that Ukraine did not attempt to negotiate in
good faith. The Russian Federation considers that Ukraine only engaged
in negotiations “with a view to bring this dispute before this Court” and
not with the objective of settling the matters in contention between the
Parties. It states that during the negotiations Ukraine did not take into
account the Russian Federation’s interests. According to the Respondent,
Ukraine also did not contemplate any modiﬁcation to its position and
refused to substantiate some of its allegations, notwithstanding requests
to do so made by the Russian Federation. The Respondent points out
that negotiations took place in Minsk at its suggestion and that it showed
its willingness “to contemplate modiﬁcations of its own position”. Fur-
thermore, the Russian Federation contends that, in its Notes Verbales,
the Applicant mainly did not address the ICSFT, but rather raised allega-
tions of acts of aggression and of intervention in the internal aﬀairs of
Ukraine.

                                     *
   68. Ukraine points out that the Parties negotiated extensively for two
years, even though the dispute ultimately could not be resolved by
negotiations. It mentions that it sent more than twenty Notes Verbales to
the Russian Federation and that the Parties met in four rounds of in-person
negotiations. Ukraine maintains that it has genuinely attempted to
negotiate with the Russian Federation and to discuss in good faith all
the issues separating them under the ICSFT. Ukraine speciﬁes that the
negotiations did not concern acts of aggression and intervention. In the
Applicant’s opinion, there was no genuine attempt by the Russian Fed-
eration to settle the dispute as it did not meaningfully engage with the
claims raised by Ukraine and refused to take account of the latter’s posi-
tions. The Applicant is of the view that, when negotiations have been
conducted “as far as possible with a view to settling the dispute” but have


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                  588

failed, become futile or reached a deadlock, the precondition of holding
negotiations is fulﬁlled. Ukraine submits that Article 24, paragraph 1, of
the ICSFT only requires negotiations to be conducted for a “reasonable
time” and not to the point of futility. Ukraine contends that it would not
have been reasonable to require further negotiations between the Parties
for an extended period of time.


                                    * *
   69. The Court considers that Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT
requires, as a ﬁrst procedural precondition to the Court’s jurisdiction,
that a State makes a genuine attempt to settle through negotiation the
dispute in question with the other State concerned. According to the same
provision, the precondition of negotiation is met when the dispute “can-
not be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time”. As was
observed in the case concerning the Application of the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(Georgia v. Russian Federation), “the subject-matter of the negotiations
must relate to the subject-matter of the dispute which, in turn, must con-
cern the substantive obligations contained in the treaty in question” (Pre-
liminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I), p. 133, para. 161).
   70. The Court recalls that, on 28 July 2014, Ukraine wrote a Note Ver-
bale to the Russian Federation, stating that

    “under the provisions of the 1999 International Convention for the
    Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the Russian Party is under
    an obligation to take such measures, which may be necessary under
    its domestic law to investigate the facts contained in the information
    submitted by the Ukrainian Party, as well as to prosecute persons
    involved in ﬁnancing of terrorism”,
and proposing “to conduct negotiations on the issue of interpretation and
application of the [ICSFT]”. On 15 August 2014, the Russian Federation
informed Ukraine of its “readiness to conduct negotiations on the issue of
interpretation and application of the [ICSFT]”. While exchanges of Notes
and meetings between the Parties did not always focus on the interpreta-
tion or application of the ICSFT, negotiations over Ukraine’s claims
relating to this Convention were a substantial part. In particular, in a
Note Verbale of 24 September 2014 Ukraine contended that

    “the Russian Side illegally, directly and indirectly, intentionally trans-
    fers military equipment, provides the funds for terrorists training on
    its territory, gives them material support and send[s] them to the ter-
    ritory of Ukraine for participation in the terrorist activities of the
    DPR and the LPR, etc.”.



            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                589

On 24 November 2014, the Russian Federation contested that the acts
alleged by Ukraine could constitute violations of the ICSFT, but accepted
that the agenda for bilateral consultations include the “international legal
basis for suppression of ﬁnancing of terrorism as applicable to the
Russian-Ukrainian relations”. After that Note, several others followed;
moreover, four meetings were held in Minsk, the last one on 17 March
2016. Little progress was made by the Parties during their negotiations.
The Court therefore concludes that the dispute could not be settled through
negotiation in what has to be regarded as a reasonable time and that the
ﬁrst precondition is accordingly met.



2. Whether the Parties were unable to agree on the organization of an
   arbitration
   71. The Russian Federation contends that Ukraine has also not satis-
ﬁed the precondition to submit the Parties’ dispute to arbitration. It
argues that Ukraine did not properly engage in negotiations with a view
to organize an arbitration. It points out that Ukraine insisted that an
ad hoc chamber of the Court should be constituted as the forum for arbi-
tration, and in the Russian Federation’s view, this suggestion was not
apposite because referral of the dispute to a chamber of the Court cannot
be regarded as a form of submission to arbitration.

   72. The Russian Federation also points out that, according to Arti-
cle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT, a claim may be brought before the
Court only if the parties have been unable to agree on the organization of
an arbitration within six months from the date of the request by one of
them for arbitration. It considers that it is not suﬃcient “as a matter of
fact” that the six-month period has elapsed without reaching any agree-
ment on the organization of the arbitration. What is required, the Respon-
dent maintains, is a “genuine attempt” to reach an agreement. In the
Russian Federation’s view, Ukraine — by insisting on some core princi-
ples that would govern the arbitration and by not submitting any con-
crete suggestions for the text of an arbitration agreement while refusing
the Russian Federation’s proposals — did not genuinely attempt to orga-
nize the arbitration pursuant to Article 24 of the ICSFT.

   73. The Russian Federation maintains that Article 24, paragraph 1, of
the ICSFT requires the parties to negotiate with a view to “agree on the
organization of the arbitration” and that accordingly they must decide on
the composition of the tribunal, the law applicable, as well as on admin-
istrative matters. The Respondent argues that the Parties were in agree-
ment with regard to most issues concerning the organization of the
arbitration. It asserts that negotiations with regard to the arbitration had
not reached a deadlock. In the Russian Federation’s view, the procedural


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 590

precondition to submit the Parties’ dispute to arbitration set forth in Arti-
cle 24 of the ICSFT has not been fulﬁlled.
                                     *
   74. Ukraine points out that it submitted to the Russian Federation a
Note Verbale dated 19 April 2016 which contained a direct request to
have recourse to arbitration with a view to settling their dispute. Con-
trary to the Russian Federation’s argument, Ukraine maintains that its
later suggestion to constitute an ad hoc chamber of the Court was only an
alternative option on which it did not insist.

   75. Ukraine argues that the Parties were unable to agree on the orga-
nization of the arbitration within the six-month period referred to in Arti-
cle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT. It notes that the Russian Federation
responded to its request for arbitration more than two months after
receiving it and only oﬀered to meet to discuss the organization of the
arbitration a further month later. Ukraine maintains moreover that at the
ﬁrst meeting the Russian Federation did not address Ukraine’s views on
the organization of the arbitration. The Applicant asserts that, when
negotiations with respect to the organization of the arbitration were dis-
continued, the Parties had only agreed to discuss the details of the arbi-
tration further and to consider each other’s positions, and had not reached
any agreement on the actual organization of the arbitration. Ukraine sub-
mits that it genuinely attempted to reach an agreement on the organiza-
tion of the arbitration within the requisite period.


                                    * *
   76. The Court recalls that, nearly two years after the start of negotia-
tions between the Parties over the dispute, Ukraine sent on 19 April 2016
a Note Verbale in which it stated that those negotiations had “failed” and
that, “pursuant to Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Financing Terrorism
Convention, [it] request[ed] the Russian Federation to submit the dispute
to arbitration under terms to be agreed by mutual consent”. Negotiations
concerning the organization of the arbitration were subsequently held
until a period of six months expired. During these negotiations, Ukraine
also suggested to refer the dispute to a procedure other than arbitration,
namely the submission of the dispute to a chamber of the Court. In any
event, the Parties were unable to agree on the organization of the arbitra-
tion during the requisite period. The second precondition stated in Arti-
cle 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT must thus be regarded as fulﬁlled.



   77. The Court therefore considers that the procedural preconditions
set forth in Article 24, paragraph 1, of the ICSFT were met. The Court


            application of the icsft and cerd (judgment)                 591

thus has jurisdiction to entertain the claims made pursuant to that provi-
sion.


     III. The International Convention on the Elimination of
                All Forms of Racial Discrimination

   78. The Court will now examine the Russian Federation’s preliminary
objections to the Court’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of Ukraine’s
claims under CERD. As stated above (see paragraph 36), the Rus-
sian Federation argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae
under CERD, and that the procedural preconditions to the Court’s juris-
diction set out in Article 22 of the Convention are not met; it also argues
that Ukraine’s Application with regard to claims under CERD is
inadmissible because local remedies had not been exhausted before the
dispute was referred to the Court. The Court will deal with each objection
in turn.



             A. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae under CERD
   79. It is the Russian Federation’s position that the real issue in dispute
between the Parties does not concern racial discrimination but the status
of Crimea. The Russian Federation contends that the measures which
Ukraine characterizes as racial discrimination are not in breach of CERD,
since they are not based on any of the grounds set out in Article 1, para-
graph 1, of CERD. According to the Respondent, Ukraine’s claims of
racial discrimination consist in asserting that measures allegedly taken by
the Russian Federation in respect of members of certain ethnic communi-
ties were motivated by the opposition of these communities to the “pur-
ported annexation” of Crimea.
   80. According to the Russian Federation, Ukraine’s attempt to deﬁne
“ethnic groups” within the meaning of CERD on the basis of political
self-identiﬁcation and opinions is misconceived. The Russian Federation
argues that Ukraine’s deﬁnition of “ethnicity” is not in consonance either
with the ordinary meaning of CERD, or with the intention of its drafters,
and is also unsupported both by State practice, and by the decisions of
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter
the “CERD Committee”). The Russian Federation does not contest, in
any event, that Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea consti-
tute distinct ethnic groups protected by CERD.


  81. The Respondent argues that the claims that it discriminated
between citizens and non-citizens are beyond the scope of CERD, in so
far as they are incompatible with Article 1, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the
