These objections were developed at considerable-length during
the course of the oral hearing. For reasons which will subsequently
appear, the Court does not find it necessary to consider all the
objections, nor to determine whether all of them are objections
to jurisdiction or to admissibility or based on other grounds.
During the course of the oral hearing little distinction if any was
made by the Parties themselves between “jurisdiction” and
“admissibility”. There are however two objections which the
Court thinks should be disposed of at this stage.

The first of these objections is the contention of the United
Kingdom that there is no “dispute” between itself and the Republic
of Cameroon. If any dispute did at the date of the Application
exist, it is the United Kingdom’s contention that it was between
the Republic of Cameroon and the United Nations or its General
Assembly.

The Court is not concerned with the question whether or not any
dispute in relation to the same subject-matter existed between the
Republic of Cameroon and the United Nations or the General
Assembly. In the view of the Court it is sufficient to say that, having
regard to the facts already stated in this Judgment, the opposing
views of the Parties as to the interpretation and application of
relevant Articles of the Trusteeship Agreement, reveal the existence
of a dispute in the sense recognized by the jurisprudence of the Court
and of its predecessor, between the Republic of Cameroon and the
United Kingdom at the date of the Application.

The other preliminary objection, that the Court finds it convenient
at this stage to deal with, is based on Article 32 (2) of the Rules of
Court which provides that when a case is brought before it by means
of an application, the application must not only indicate the subject
of the dispute as laid down in Article 40 of the Court’s Statute but
it must also “as far as possible” specify the provision on which
the Applicant founds the jurisdiction of the Court, and state the
precise nature of the claim and the grounds on which it is based.

In the Observations and Submissions of the Republic of Cam-
eroon, this objection is treated separately as one to the admissi-
bility of the Application and the Memorial.

The Court cannot be indifferent to any failure, whether by
Applicant or Respondent, to comply with its Rules which have
been framed in accordance with Article 30 of its Statute. The Per-
manent Court of International Justice in several cases felt called
upon to consider whether the formal requirements of its Rules
had been met. In such matters of form it tended to “take a broad



view”. (The “Société Commerciale de Belgique”, P.C.1.]., Series A/B,
No. 78, p. 173.) The Court agrees with the view expressed by the
Permanent Court in the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case

(P.C.I.]., Series A, No. 2, p. 34):

“The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to
attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which
they might possess in municipal law.”

The Court is quite conscious of the Applicant’s deeply felt concern
over events referred to in its pleadings and if there were no other
reason which in its opinion would prevent it from examining the
case on the merits, it would not refuse to proceed because of the
lack of what the Permanent Court in the case of the Inierpretation
of the Statute of the Memel Territory, called a “‘convenient and
appropriate method in which to bring the difference of opinion
before the Court” (P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 49, p. 311).

The Court notes that whilst under Article 40 of its Statute the
subject of a dispute brought before the Court shall be indicated,
Article 32 (2) of the Rules of Court requires the Applicant “as far as
possible” to do certain things. These words apply not only to speci-
fying the provision on which the Applicant founds the jurisdiction
of the Court, but also to stating the precise nature of the claim and
giving a succinct statement of the facts and grounds on which the
claim is based. In the view of the Court the Applicant has sufficiently
complied with the provisions of Article 32 (2) of the Rules and the
preliminary objection based upon non-compliance therewith is
accordingly without substance.

The arguments of the Parties have at times been at cross-purposes
because of the absence of a common meaning ascribed to such terms
as “interest” and ‘‘admissibility’’. The Court recognizes that these
words in differing contexts may have varying connotations but it
does not find it necessary in the present case to explore the meaning
of these terms. For the purposes of the present case, a factual
analysis undertaken in the light of certain guiding principles may
suffice to conduce to the resolution of the issues to which the
Court directs its attention.

The geographical propinquity of the Republic of Cameroon to
the former Trust Territory of the Northern Cameroons, and the
degree of affinity between the populations of the two regions, led
the Republic of Cameroon to view the developments regarding the
former Trust Territory with intense concern. The Court cannot
blind its eyes to the indisputable fact that if the result of the
plebiscite in the Northern Cameroons had not favoured joining the
Federation of Nigeria, it would have favoured joining the Republic
of Cameroon. No third choice was presented in the questions framed



by the General Assembly and no other alternative was contem-
poraneously discussed.

The Republic of Cameroon, as a Member of the United Nations
as from 20 September 1960, had a right to apply to the Court and
by the filing of the Application of 30 May 1961 the Court was
seised. This procedural right to apply to the Court, where, whatever
the outcome, all aspects of a matter can be discussed in the objective
atmosphere of a court of justice, is by no means insubstantial.
The filing of an application instituting proceedings, however, does
not prejudge the action which the Court may take to deal with the
case.

In its Judgment of 18 November 1953 on the Preliminary
Objection in the Nottebohm case (I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122), the
Court had occasion to deal at some length with the nature of
seisin and the consequences of seising the Court. As this Court said
in that Judgment: ‘the seising of the Court is one thing, the
administration of justice is another”. It is the act of the Applicant
which seises the Court but even if the Court, when seised, finds
that it has jurisdiction, the Court is not compelled in every case
to exercise that jurisdiction. There are inherent limitations on the
exercise of the judicial function which the Court, as a court of
justice, can never ignore. There may thus be an incompatibility
between the desires of an applicant, or, indeed, of both parties to a
case, on the one hand, and on the other hand the duty of the Court
to maintain its judicial character. The Court itself, and not the
parties, must be the guardian of the Court’s judicial integrity.

In the Free Zones case, the Permanent Court referred to three
different considerations which would lead it to decline to give
judgment on questions posed by the parties. These were raised by
the Court proprio motu. In the Order of 19 August 1929 (P.C.I.J.,
Series A, No. 22, p. 15), the Court in the first place said that—

“the Court cannot as a general rule be compelled to choose between
constructions [of a treaty] determined beforehand none of which
may correspond to the opinion at which it may arrive...”

In the second place, in its Judgment of 7 June 1932 in the same
case (P.C.1.J., Series A/B, No. 46, p. 161) the Court said:

“After mature consideration, the Court maintains its opinion that
it would be incompatible with the Statute, and with its position as
a Court of Justice, to give a judgment which would be dependent
for its validity on the subsequent approval of the Parties.”

Finally the Court went on to say (at p. 162), in regard to paragraph
2 of Article 2 of the Special Agreement which would have involved a



decision by the Court on questions such as specific tariff exemptions
to be established, that the task thus assigned to the Court by the
parties was “unsuitable to the role of a Court of Justice”. Moreover,
the “interplay of economic interests” posed questions—

“outside the sphere in which a Court of Justice, concerned with the
application of rules of law, can help in the solution of disputes
between two States’.

The Court may, of course, give advisory opinions—not at the
request of a State but at the request of a duly authorized
organ or agency of the United Nations. But both the Permanent
Court of International Justice and this Court have emphasized
the fact that the Court’s authority to give advisory opinions must
be exercised as a judicial function. Both Courts have had occa-
sion to make pronouncements concerning requests for advisory
opinions, which are equally applicable to the proper role of the
Court in disposing of contested cases; in both situations, the
Court is exercising a judicial function. That function is circum-
scribed by inherent limitations which are none the less imperative
because they may be difficult to catalogue, and may not frequently
present themselves as a conclusive bar to adjudication in a concrete
case. Nevertheless, it is always a matter for the determination of
the Court whether its judicial functions are involved. This Court,
like the Permanent Court of International Justice, has always
been guided by the principle which the latter stated in the case
concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia on 23 July 1923:

“The Court, being a Court of Justice, cannot, even in giving
advisory opinions, depart from the essential rules guiding their
activity as a Court.” (P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 5, p. 29.)

In the Haya de la Torre case (I.C.J. Reports 1951, pp. 78-79), the
Court noted that both parties sought from the Court a decision
“as to the manner in which the asylum should be terminated”.
It ordered that the asylum should terminate but refused to indicate
means to be employed to give effect to its order. The Court said:

“The interrogative form in which they have formulated their
Submissions shows that they desire that the Court should make a
choice amongst the various courses by which the asylum may be
terminated. But these coursés are conditioned by facts and by
possibilities which, to a very large extent, the Parties are alone in
a position to appreciate. A choice amongst them could not be based
on legal considerations, but only on considerations of practicability
or of political expediency; it is not part of the Court’s judicial
function to make such a choice.”



To determine whether the adjudication sought by the Applicant
is one which the Court’s judicial function permits it to give, the
Court must take into account certain facts in the present case.

*
+ +

The Applicant’s explanations of what it does and does not ask
the Court to decide, are variously formulated in its written and oral
pleadings. The Court believes that the clearest explanation 1s to be
found in the Applicant’s Observations and Submissions as follows:

“When a State brings an action before the Court on the basis of
a provision of the nature of Article 1g of the Trusteeship Agreement
for the Cameroons under British administration, it may no doubt
in certain cases, in addition to seeking a finding that a violation
of the Trusteeship Agreement has been committed, ask the Court
to declare that the administering Power is under an obligation to
put an end to that violation. Thus, in the South West Africa cases,
Ethiopia and Liberia in their submissions asked the Court both
for a finding of certain violations (the policy of apartheid, failure
to render annual reports, failure to transmit petitions, etc.) and for
a declaration that South Africa is under an obligation to bring these
violations to an end. But this can only be so when what is involved
is what might be called a ‘continuing violation’ capable of being
stopped pursuant to the Court’s Judgment. When, on the other
hand, the breach of the agreement has been finally consummated
and it is physically impossible to undo the past, the Applicant
State is no longer in a position to ask the Court for more than a
finding, with force of res judicata, that the Trusteeship Agreement
has not been respected by the administering Power.

In the case in point the violations referred to have been finally
consummated, and the Republic of Cameroon cannot ask for a
reshtutio in integrum having the effect of non-occurrence of the
union with Nigeria and non-division of the Territory, or fulfilment
of the objectives laid down in Article 6 of the Agreement, or ob-
servance of Resolution 1473; it can only ask for a finding by the
Court of the breaches of the Trusteeship Agreement committed by
the Administering Authority.”

In the course of his oral argument, Counsel for the Applicant
said:

“The Republic of Cameroon considersin fact that, by administering
the Northern Cameroons as it did, the Administering Authority
created such conditions that the Trusteeship led to the attachment
of the northern part of the Cameroons to a State other than the
Republic of Cameroon.”

In the Cameroon White Book already mentioned, it is said that
“failure to separate the administrations of the two territories
destroyed an essential guarantee of impartiality and effectively
sabotaged the plebiscite”. The White Book continued by saying:



“The only acceptable solution to avoid a monstrous injustice ... is
to declare the plebiscite ... null and void...”

The injustice alleged seems clearly enough to have been ‘“the
attachment of the northern part of the Cameroons to a State other
than the Republic of Cameroon”.

But the Court is not asked to redress the alleged injustice; it
is not asked to detach territory from Nigeria; it is not asked to
restore to the Republic of Cameroon peoples or territories claimed
to have been lost; it is not asked to award reparation of any kind.

It was not to this Court but to the General Assembly of the
United Nations that the Republic of Cameroon directed the argu-
ment and the plea for a declaration that the plebiscite was null and
void. In paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 of resolution 1608 (XV),
the General Assembly rejected the Cameroon plea. Whatever the
motivation of the General Assembly in reaching the conclusions
contained in those paragraphs, whether or not it was acting wholly
on the political plane and without the Court finding it necessary to
consider here whether or not the General Assembly based its
action on a correct interpretation of the Trusteeship Agreement,
there is no doubt—and indeed no controversy—that the resolution
had definitive legal effect. The plebiscite was not declared null and
void but, on the contrary, its results were endorsed and the General
Assembly decided that the Trusteeship Agreement should be
terminated with respect to the Northern Cameroons on r June
1961. In the event, the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement
was a legal effect of the conclusions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of reso-
lution 1608 (XV). The Applicant here has expressly said it does not
ask the Court to revise or to reverse those conclusions of the General
Assembly or those decisions as such, and it is not therefore neces-
sary to consider whether the Court could exercise such an authority.
But the Applicant does ask the Court to appreciate certain facts
and to reach conclusions on those facts at variance with the con-
clusions stated by the General Assembly in resolution 1608 (XV).

If the Court were to decide that it can deal with the case on the
merits, and if thereafter, following argument on the merits, the
Court decided, inter alia, that the establishment and the maintenance
of the administrative union between the Northern Cameroons and
Nigeria was a violation of the Trusteeship Agreement, it would
still remain true that the General Assembly, acting within its
acknowledged competence, was not persuaded that either the
administrative union, or other alleged factors, invalidated the
plebiscite as a free expression of the will of the people. Since the
Court has not, in the Applicant’s submissions, been asked to review
that conclusion of the General Assembly, a decision by the Court,
for example that the Administering Authority had violated the

ZI


Trusteeship Agreement, would not establish a causal connection
between that violation and the result of the plebiscite.

Moreover, the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and the
ensuing joinder of the Northern Cameroons to the Federation of
Nigeria were not the acts of the United Kingdom but the result of
actions of the General Assembly, actions to which the United
Kingdom assented. Counsel for the Republic of Cameroon admit-
ted that it was the United Nations which terminated the Trustee-
ship. He said:

“Cameroon is not asking the Court to criticize the United Nations;
Cameroon is not asking the Court to say that the United Nations
was wrong in terminating the Trusteeship; Cameroon is not asking
the Court to pronounce the annulment of resolution 1608. The
Court, of course, would not be competent to do that...”

The administrative union, as established during the Trusteeship,
whether legally or illegally, no longer exists. The Republic of
Cameroon, however, contends that its interest in knowing whether
that union was a violation of the Trusteeship Agreement, is not a
merely academic one. It in fact contends that there was a causal
connection between the allegedly illegal administrative union and
the alleged invalidity of the plebiscite. Counsel for the Republic of
Cameroon made this contention clear in a passage already quoted.

But the Applicant has stated that it does not ask the Court to
invalidate the plebiscite; indeed as noted, it recognizes the Court
could not do so. It has not asked the Court to find any causal
connection between the alleged maladministration and the result of
the vote favouring union with the Federation of Nigeria. Asa result,
the Court is relegated to an issue remote from reality.

If the Court were to proceed and were to hold that the-Applicant’s
contentions were all sound on the merits, it would still be impossible
for the Court to render a judgment capable of effective application.
The role of the Court is not the same as that of the General Assem-
bly. The decisions of the General Assembly would not be reversed
by the judgment of the Court. The Trusteeship Agreement would
not be revived and given new life by the judgment. The former
Trust Territory of the Northern Cameroons would not be joined
to the Republic of Cameroon. The union of that territory with the
Federation of Nigeria would not be invalidated. The United
Kingdom would have no right or authority to take any action with
a view to satisfying the underlying desires of the Republic of
Cameroon. In accordance with Article 5¢ of the Statute, the
judgment would not be binding on Nigeria, or on any other State,
or on any organ of the United Nations. These truths are not
controverted by the Applicant.

The function of the Court is to state the law, but it may pronounce
judgment only in connection with concrete cases where there



exists at the time of the adjudication an actual controversy in-
volving a conflict of legal interests between the parties. The
Court’s judgment must have some practical consequence in the
sense that it can affect existing legal rights or obligations of the
parties, thus removing uncertainty from their legal relations. No
judgment on the merits in this case could satisfy these essentials
of the judicial function.

*
* *

The Trusteeship Agreement with respect to the Northern Cam-
eroons having been validly terminated by resolution 1608 (XV), the
Trust itself disappeared; the United Kingdom ceased to have the
rights and duties of a trustee with respect to the Cameroons;
and what was formerly the Trust Territory of the Northern Cam-
eroons has joined the independent Federation of Nigeria and is
now a part of that State.

Looking at the situation brought about by the termination of the
Trusteeship Agreement from the point of view of a Member of the
United Nations, other than the Administering Authority itself, it
is clear that any rights which may have been granted by the
Articles of the Trusteeship Agreement to other Members of the
United Nations or their nationals came to an end. This is not to say
that, for example, property rights which might have been obtained
in accordance with certain Articles of the Trusteeship Agreement
and which might have vested before the termination of the Agree-
ment, would have been divested by the termination. It is the fact,
however, that after 1 June 1961 when the Trust over the Northern
Cameroons ceased to exist, no other Member of the United Nations
could thereafter claim any of the rights or privileges in the Northern
Cameroons which might have been originally granted by the
Trusteeship Agreement. No such claim could be made on the
United Kingdom which as trustee was funcius officio and divested
of all power and authority and responsibility in the area. No such
claim could be made on Nigeria, which now has sovereignty over
the territory, since Nigeria was not a party to the Trusteeship
Agreement and never had any obligations under it. Nor is it
apparent how such a claim could be made against the United
Nations itself. Moreover, pursuant to Article 59 of the Statute a
judgment of the Court in this case would bind only the two Parties.

The claim of the Republic of Cameroon is solely for a finding of a
breach of the law. No further action is asked of the Court or can be
added. Normally when the Court pronounces a judicial condem-
nation there is room for the application of Article 94 of the Charter.
That is not the case here. Normally under the International Trustee-
ship System such a finding, if the Court were competent to make
it, might lead the General Assembly to do whatever it thought



useful or desirable in the light of the judgment pronounced as
between a Member of the United Nations and an Administering
Authority for the territory in question. In the present case, however,
the General Assembly is no longer competent pursuant to the
termination of the Trusteeship as a result of resolution 1608 (XV).

Nevertheless, it may be contended that if during the life of the
Trusteeship the Trustee was responsible for some act in violation
of the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement which resulted in
damage to another Member of the United Nations or to one of its
nationals, a claim for reparation would not be liquidated by the
termination of the Trust. Of course Article 19 of the Agreement
which provided for the jurisdiction of the Court in the cases which
it covered, was terminated with all other Articles of the Agreement,
so that after 1 June 1961 it could not be invoked as a basis for the
Court’s jurisdiction. The Application in the instant case was filed
before 1 June 1961 but it does not include, and the Applicant
has expressly stated that it does not make, any claim for reparation.

The Court is aware of the fact that the arguments of both Parties
made frequent references to the Judgment of the Court of 21 Decem-
ber 1962 in the South West Africa cases. The arguments dealt with
the question whether conclusions arrived at in the consideration
of the Mandates System under the League of Nations were appli-
cable to the Trusteeship System under the United Nations, and
whether, and if so to what extent, Article 19 of the Trusteeship
Agreement of 1946 for the Cameroons was to be given in certain
respects an interpretation similar to that given to Article 7 of the
Mandate for South West Africa.

The Court does not find it necessary to pronounce an opinion on
these points which, in so far as concerns the operation or adminis-
tration of the Trusteeship for the Northern Cameroons, can have
only an academic interest since that Trusteeship is no longer in
existence, and no determination reached by the Court could be
given effect to by the former Administering Authority.

Nevertheless, for the purpose of testing certain contentions in
this case, the Court will consider what conclusions would be reached
if it were common ground that Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agree-
ment of 13 December 1946 for the Cameroons under British Adminis-
tiation was designed to provide a form of judicial protection in
the particular interest of the inhabitants of the territory and
in the general interest in the successful functioning of the Inter-
national Trusteeship System; that this judicial protection was pro-
vided and existed side by side with the various provisions for adminis-
trative supervision and control through the Trusteeship Council, its
visiting missions, hearing of petitioners, and action by the General
Assembly; that any Member of the United Nations had a right to



invoke this judicial protection and specifically that the Republic of
Cameroon had the right to invoke it by filing an application in this
Court. It would then follow that in filing its Application on 30 May
1961, the Republic of Cameroon exercised a procedural right which
appertained to it—a procedural right which was to be exercised
in the general interest, whatever may have been the material
individual interest of the Republic of Cameroon. But within two
days after the filing of the Application the substantive interest
which that procedural right would have protected, disappeared
with the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement with respect
to the Northern Cameroons. After 1 June 1961 there was no “trust
territory” and no inhabitants for whose protection the trust
functions could be exercised. It must be assumed that the General
Assembly was mindful of the general interest when, acting with-
in its competence, it decided on the termination of the Trust
with respect to the Northern Cameroons and the joinder of the
Northern Cameroons to the Federation of Nigeria. Thereafter, and
as a result of this decision of the General Assembly, the whole
system of administrative supervision came to an end. Thereafter
the United Nations could not, under the authority of Article 87 of
the Charter, send into the Territory a visiting mission to report
on prevailing conditions. The Trusteeship Council could no longer
examine petitions from inhabitants of the Territory, as indeed it
decided at its 1178th meeting on Ir January 1962. The General
Assembly could no longer make recommendations based upon its
functions under Chapters XII and XIII of the Charter.

The Court cannot agree that under these circumstances the
judicial protection claimed by the Applicant to have existed
under the Trusteeship System, would have alone survived when
all of the concomitant elements to which it was related had dis-
appeared. Accordingly, the Republic of Cameroon would not have
had a right after 1 June 1961, when the Trusteeship Agreement
was terminated and the Trust itself came to an end, to ask the
Court to adjudicate at this stage upon questions affecting the rights
of the inhabitants of the former Trust Territory and the general
interest in the successful functioning of the Trusteeship System.

*

Throughout these proceedings the contention of the Republic of
Cameroon has been that all it seeks is a declaratory judgment of
the Court that prior to the termination of the Trusteeship Agree-
ment with respect to the Northern Cameroons, the United Kingdom
had breached the provisions of the Agreement, and that, if its
Application were admissible and the Court had jurisdiction to
proceed to the merits, such a declaratory judgment is not only
one the Court could make but one that it should make.



That the Court may, in an appropriate case, make a declaratory
judgment is indisputable. The Court has, however, already indicated
that even if, when seised of an Application, the Court finds that it
has jurisdiction, it is not obliged to exercise it in all cases. If
the Court is satisfied, whatever the nature of the relief claimed,
that to adjudicate on the merits of an Application would be
inconsistent with its judicial function, it should refuse to do so.

Moreover the Court observes that if in a declaratory judgment
it expounds a rule of customary law or interprets a treaty which
remains in force, its judgment has a continuing applicability. But
in this case there is a dispute about the interpretation and appli-
cation of a treaty—the Trusteeship Agreement—which has now
been terminated, is no longer in force, and there can be no oppor-
tunity for a future act of interpretation or application of that
treaty in accordance with any judgment the Court might render.

In its Interpretation of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (the Chorzow
Factory ) (P.C.1.]., Series A, No. 13, p. 20) the Court said:

“The Court’s Judgment No. 7 is in the nature of a declaratory
judgment, the intention of which is to ensure recognition of a
situation at law, once and for all and with binding force as between
the Parties; so that the legal position thus established cannot
again be called in question in so far as the legal effects ensuing
therefrom are concerned.”

The Applicant, however, seeks to minimize the importance of
the forward reach of a judgment of the Court. It has maintained
that it is seeking merely a statement of the law which would
“constitute a vital pronouncement for the people of Cameroon”.
It has indeed asked the Court not to consider the aftermath of its
judgment and in this connection it has cited the judgment of the
Court in the Haya de la Torre case, quoted above. But there is a
difference between the Court’s considering the manner of com-
pliance with its Judgment, or the likelihood of compliance, and,
on the other hand, considering whether the judgment, if rendered,
would be susceptible of any compliance or execution whatever,
at any time in the future.

As the Court said in the Haya de la Torre case, it cannot concern
itself with the choice among various practical steps which a State
may take to comply with a judgment. It may also be agreed, as
Counsel for the Applicant suggested, that after a judgment is
rendered, the use which the successful party makes of the judgment
is a matter which lies on the political and not on the judicial plane.
But it is not the function of a court merely to provide a basis for
political action if no question of actual legal rights is involved.
Whenever the Court adjudicates on the merits of a dispute, one or
the other party, or both parties, as a factual matter, areina position
to take some retroactive or prospective action or avoidance of



action, which would constitute a compliance with the Court’s
judgment or a defiance thereof. That is not the situation here.

+
* *

The Court must discharge the duty to which it has already called
attention—the duty to safeguard the judicial function. Whether or
not at the moment the Application was filed there was jurisdiction
in the Court to adjudicate upon the dispute submitted to it, circum-
stances that have since arisen render any adjudication devoid of
purpose. Under these conditions, for the Court to proceed further
in the case would not, in its opinion, be a proper discharge of its
duties.

The answer to the question whether the judicial function is
engaged may, in certain cases where the issue is raised, need to wait
upon an examination of the merits. In the present case, however,
it is already evident that it cannot be engaged. No purpose ac-
cordingly would be served by undertaking an examination of the
merits in the case for the purpose of reaching a decision which,
in the light of the circumstances to which the Court has already
called attention, ineluctably must be made.

*
+ *

For the reasons which it has given, the Court has not felt called
upon to pass expressly upon the several submissions of the Respond-
ent, in the form in which they have been cast. The Court finds that
the proper limits of its judicial function do not permit it to entertain
the claims submitted to it in the Application of which it has been
seised, with a view to a decision having the authority of res judicata
between the Republic of Cameroon and the United Kingdom. Any
judgment which the Court might pronounce would be without
object.

For these reasons,
THE COURT,
by ten votes to five,

finds that it cannot adjudicate upon the merits of the claim
of the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
