       1. Having voted in favour of the conclusions reached by the Court, I nevertheless consider it
appropriate to submit some considerations on the reasoning of the Court. I will discuss briefly only
three aspects, namely the relationship between the application of the Monetary Gold principle 1 and
the Agreement between Venezuela and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
(the “Geneva Agreement”), the subsequent practice of the parties to the Geneva Agreement, as well
as the subject-matter of the dispute before the Court. These issues are interlinked. The objective of
this declaration is to endorse the reasoning of the Court either by supplementing it or by emphasizing
a particular aspect.

       2. Venezuela relied, in its reasoning, dominantly on the Monetary Gold principle, arguing that
the United Kingdom was an indispensable third party without the participation of which the
Application of Guyana was inadmissible 2. It is hard to deny that, at first glance, the situation in this
dispute resembles the factual situation between Albania, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America in the case of Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 and the situation
between Indonesia, Portugal and Australia in the East Timor case (Portugal v. Australia) 3. What is
different in the present case is the existence of the Geneva Agreement between Venezuela, the
United Kingdom and, ultimately, Guyana.

       3. I agree with the findings of the Judgment that the United Kingdom directly or indirectly
declined to take part in the attempts to resolve the controversy over the dispute between Venezuela
and then British Guiana. Referring to Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, the Geneva
Agreement provides for possible avenues for resolving the dispute by non-judicial or judicial means.
By leaving the resolution of the dispute to Venezuela and now Guyana alone 4, the United Kingdom
made it clear that it would not participate in the endeavour. While accepting the sole obligation of
these two States, the United Kingdom was well aware that, in resolving the dispute, acts or omissions
of the arbitrators appointed by the United Kingdom, as well as activities of representatives of the
United Kingdom in the context of the 1899 Award, may be addressed.

       4. Theoretically, there are two options regarding how to interpret the Geneva Agreement. One
option is to consider that the Geneva Agreement embodies the consent of the United Kingdom as
required under the Monetary Gold principle, so that the Court may exercise its jurisdiction in this
case without the United Kingdom participating. The second and preferable option is, in my view,
that treaty arrangements, such as the Geneva Agreement, and the Monetary Gold principle are two
parallel approaches to protect procedurally the interests of a third State — here the United Kingdom.
Whereas the Monetary Gold principle covers the issue in the abstract, the Geneva Agreement covers
the particular situation before the Court and thus is to be considered a lex specialis. It is therefore

      5. Consequently, I agree with the Court’s conclusion that it was unnecessary to consider further
the applicability of the Monetary Gold principle. As the Judgment rightly states in paragraph 107,
the Monetary Gold principle does “not come into play”.

       7. The Judgment considers it necessary to assess the subsequent practice of the parties to the
Geneva Agreement under Article 31 (3) (b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (see
para. 103 of the Judgment). The Court has dealt with the issue of subsequent practice in several cases,
including in detail in the Kasikili/Sedudu Island case 5. I wonder whether the long quotations in
paragraphs 104 and 105 provide any direct information on the practice of the three parties to the
Geneva Agreement. It is evident, though, that neither Venezuela nor Guyana attempted to draw the
United Kingdom into the ongoing discourse concerning the settlement of the dispute, nor was there
any initiative on the side of the United Kingdom to influence the discourse between Guyana and
Venezuela. This has been appropriately stated in paragraph 106 of the Judgment.

       8. The Judgment does not pronounce itself on the subject-matter of the dispute in detail.
However, Venezuela has stated in a variety of contexts that the interests of the United Kingdom also
form the very subject-matter of any decision that the Court would have to render on the merits,
because the invalidity of the 1899 Award arises from the allegedly fraudulent conduct of the
United Kingdom in respect of the arbitration which resulted in the 1899 Award 6. Venezuela also
submits that the disposition of the commitments and responsibilities of the United Kingdom
constitutes the “very object” and the “very essence” of the decision in the current case7. It remains
unclear as to whether Venezuela refers to the subject-matter of this dispute as an important element
of the future deliberations or whether Venezuela attempts to redefine the subject-matter which was
originally defined on the basis of the Application of Guyana. In light of this uncertainty, it seems
appropriate to introduce some clarifying remarks on the subject-matter of this dispute before the
Court.

       9. The Court has on several occasions pronounced itself on the subject-matter of a dispute. In
the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, it stated:

               “There is no doubt that it is for the Applicant, in its Application, to present to the
       Court the dispute with which it wishes to seise the Court and to set out the claims which
       it is submitting to it.

                 Paragraph 1 of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court requires moreover that the
          ‘subject of the dispute’ be indicated in the Application; and, for its part, paragraph 2 of
          Article 38 of the Rules of Court requires ‘the precise nature of the claim’ to be specified
          in the Application. In a number of instances in the past the Court has had occasion to
          refer to these provisions. It has characterized them as ‘essential from the point of view
          of legal security and the good administration of justice’ and, on this basis, has held
          inadmissible new claims, formulated during the course of proceedings, which, if they
          had been entertained, would have transformed the subject of the dispute originally
          brought before it under the terms of the Application (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru
          (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.CJ. Reports 1992,
          pp. 266-267; see also Prince von Pless Administration, Order of 4 February 1933,
          P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 52, p. 14, and Société Commerciale de Belgique, Judgment,
          1939, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 78, p. 173).” 8

          10. In the earlier Fisheries case, the Court had stated, and this is of relevance for this case:

                 “The subject of the dispute being quite concrete, the Court cannot entertain the
          suggestion made by the Agent of the United Kingdom Government at the sitting of
          October 1st, 1951, that the Court should deliver a Judgment which for the moment
          would confine itself to adjudicating on the definitions, principles or rules stated, a
          suggestion which, moreover, was objected to by the Agent of the Norwegian
          Government at the sitting of October 5th, 1951. These are elements, which might
          furnish reasons in support of the Judgment, but cannot constitute the decision. It further
          follows that even understood in this way, these elements may be taken into account only
          in so far as they would appear to be relevant for deciding the sole question in dispute,
          namely, the validity or otherwise under international law of the lines of delimitation
          laid down by the 1935 Decree.” 10

particular attention should be paid to the formulation of the applicant. In the case at hand, it is to be
noted that the Court, in its Judgment of 18 December 2020, had stated that the subject-matter of the
dispute was “the validity of the 1899 Award about the frontier between British Guiana and Venezuela
and the related question of the definitive settlement of the land boundary between Guyana and
Venezuela” 12. The Court had reached its conclusion in that Judgment on the basis of the Geneva
Agreement. This subject-matter is to be distinguished from arguments “used by the parties to sustain
their respective submissions on the dispute”, as stated in the Fisheries Jurisdiction case 13.
