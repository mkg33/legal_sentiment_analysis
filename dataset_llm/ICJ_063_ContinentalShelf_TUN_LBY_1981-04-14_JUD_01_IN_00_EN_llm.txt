17. The Court will now examine the legal problems involved in Malta’s
request for permission to intervene in the present continental shelf case
between Tunisia and Libya. Certain objections have been raised to Malta’s
request by each of the Parties in relation to all three matters specified in
Article 81, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Rules. One objection is that Malta
has not succeeded in showing the existence of “an interest of a legal nature
which may be affected by the decision in the case” within the meaning of
Article 62 of the Statute. Another is that the object of Malta’s request, as
declared and defined in its Application, falls altogether outside the scope
of the form of intervention for which Article 62 provides. The objection has
further been made that, even if not expressly mentioned in Article 62, a link
of jurisdiction between the States seeking to intervene and the parties to
the case has necessarily, under Article 36 of the Statute, to be considered an
essential condition of the grant of permission to intervene, more especially
when the case is submitted to the Court by special agreement ; and that
Malta has not established any such jurisdictional link in the present
instance. The Court observes that under paragraph 2 of Article 62 it is for
the Court itself to decide upon any request for permission to intervene
under that Article. The Court, at the same time, emphasizes that it does not
consider paragraph 2 to confer upon it any general discretion to accept or
reject a request for permission to intervene for reasons simply of policy. On
the contrary, in the view of the Court the task entrusted to it by that
paragraph is to determine the admissibility or otherwise of the request by
reference to the relevant provisions of the Statute.

18. In the present case, if any one of the objections raised by the Parties
should be found by the Court to be justified, it will clearly not be open to
the Court to give any further consideration to the request. As the questions
of the interest of a legal nature which Malta alleges may be affected by the
Court’s decision in the present case and of the object of Malta’s interven-
tion are closely connected, the Court will examine these two questions
together.

19. Theinterest of a legal nature invoked by Malta does not relate to any
legal interest of its own directly in issue as between Tunisia and Libya in
the present proceedings or as between itself and either one of those coun-
tries. It concerns rather the potential implications of reasons which the
Court may give in its decision in the present case on matters in issue as
between Tunisia and Libya with respect to the delimitation of their con-
tinental shelves for a subsequent delimitation of Malta’s own continental
shelf. In particular, as the Court has previously indicated, Malta says that
its legal interests may be affected by the Court’s appreciation of certain
geographical and geomorphological features in the area and by its assess-
ment of their legal relevance and value as factors in the delimitation of
areas of the continental shelf which, it says, are adjacent to its own
continental shelf, as well as by any pronouncements by the Court on, for



example, the application of equitable principles or special circumstances in
regard to that area. The object of its intervention, Malta explains, would be
to enable it to submit its views on issues raised in the present case of the
kind just mentioned before the Court has given its decision in the case. At
the same time, however, Malta is at pains in paragraph 22 of its Applica-
tion to stress that :

“it is not Malta’s object, by way, or in the course, of intervention in the
Libya/ Tunisia case, to obtain any form of ruling or decision from the
Court concerning its continental shelf boundaries with either or both
of those countries”.

Moreover, to leave no doubt whatever on this point, Malta again under-
lines in paragraph 24 of its Application that the intervention for which it
requests permission “would not seek any substantive or operative decision
against either party”.

20. The limited object of the intervention which Malta seeks has already
been referred to by the Court. Malta has explained that, in applying for
permission to intervene in the Tunisia/ Libya proceedings it “is not seeking
to appear as a plaintiff or claimant against either of those States, or to
assert any specific right against either of them as such”. “Malta”, its
Counsel said, “is not seeking to take sides” in the Tunisia/ Libya case, or
“to obtain from the Court a decision on the continental shelf boundary”
between itself and Tunisia and Libya. Such a determination, Malta
recognized, would not be the proper object either of the present Applica-
tion or of the intervention if it were allowed.

21. The limit thus placed by the Government of Malta on the scope of
the intervention which it seeks, and the very character of that intervention,
raise both the question whether its Application is really based on an
interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the
Tunisia/ Libya case, and the question whether the form of intervention for
which Article 62 of the Statute provides includes the intervention that is
the object of Malta’s Application. The Statute of the Court provides for
two different forms of intervention : one under Article 62 which allows a
State to request permission to intervene if it should consider itself to have
“an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the
case” ; and the other under Article 63 which gives parties to a convention
the construction of which is in question in a case “the right to intervene in
the proceedings”. The two Articles with their two forms of intervention,
the records show, were taken into the present Statute directly from the
corresponding Articles 62 and 63 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice and with only minor changes of language.

22. Article 62 had no forerunner in State practice in 1920, being intro-
duced into the draft Statute by the Advisory Committee of Jurists in the
course of their consideration of what is now Article 63. The Committee
had before it, inter alia, a plan for the Court previously worked out by a
Conference of Five Neutral Powers, paragraph 1 of Article 48 of which



read : “Whenever a dispute submitted to the Court affects the interests of a
third State, the latter may intervene in the case.” When the Advisory
Committee began its consideration of Article 63 of the Statute, the sug-
gestion was made that it should be completed by the addition of Article 48
of the Five Powers plan. The point having been made that “the interests
affected must be legitimate interests”, the President of the Advisory Com-
mittee, Baron Descamps, proposed :

“Should a State consider that it has an interest of a legal nature,
which may be affected by the decision in the case, it may submit a
request to the Court to be permitted to intervene. It will be for the
Court to decide upon this request.”

This formula was adopted by the Committee, subject to revision, and it was
decided to make the new provision a separate article inserted immediately
before Article 63. In the French text — the text established by the Com-
mittee — it was sought to make the phrase “un intérêt d’ordre juridique le
concernant est en cause” more precise by revising it so as to read “un
intérét d’ordre juridique est pour lui en cause”. In the English text, the
corresponding phrase “interest of a legal nature which may be affected by
the decision in the case” was at the same time completed by adding the
words “as a third party”. What was intended to be the precise significance
of that addition is not stated in the Committee’s records. However, when
the words “as a third party” added to the English text are read together
with the revised wording of the French text “est pour lui en cause”, it
becomes clear that the interest of a legal nature to which Article 62 was
intended to refer was an interest which is in issue in the proceedings and
consequently one that “may be affected by the decision in the case”.

23. When the Permanent Court began, in 1922, to consider its rules of
procedure for applying Article 62 of the Statute, it became apparent that
different views were held as to the object and form of the intervention
allowed under that Article, and also as to the need for a basis of jurisdiction
vis-a-vis the parties to the case. Some Members of the Permanent Court
took the view that only an interest of a legal nature in the actual subject of
the dispute itself would justify the intervention under Article 62 ; others
considered that it would be enough for the State seeking to intervene to
show that its interests might be affected by the position adopted by the
Court in the particular case. Similarly, while some Members of the Court
regarded the existence of a link of jurisdiction with the parties to the case as
a further necessary condition for intervention under Article 62, others
thought that it would be enough simply to establish the existence of an
interest of a legal nature which might be affected by the Court’s decision in
the case. The outcome of the discussion was that it was agreed not to try to
resolve in the Rules of Court the various questions which had been raised,
but to leave them to be decided as and when they occurred in practice and
in the light of the circumstances of each particular case.

24. In the event, the Permanent Court was confronted with intervention
under Article 62 in only one case, the S.S. “Wimbledon” case, in which



Poland’s application to intervene had been framed on the basis of that
Article. In the application, however, Poland had referred to its participa-
tion in the Treaty of Versailles, the provisions of which regarding the Kiel
Canal were the subject-matter of the case ; and at the suggestion of one of
the Parties to the case it supplemented the basis of its application by also
invoking Article 63, before the Court came to pronounce upon it. As to the
Parties to the case, they did not raise any objection to Poland’s interven-
tion. The Permanent Court decided to uphold the application simply on
the basis of Article 63 and found it unnecessary to consider whether the
intervention might equally have been “justified by an interest of a legal
nature, within the meaning of Article 62 of the Statute” (P.C.1.J., Series A,
No. 1, pp. 11-14). Thus when the Permanent Court revised its Rules it had
not had any real experience of the operation of Article 62 in practice ; and
in consequence its further debates on the Rules do not throw a great deal of
new light on the problems involved in the application of that Article. For
present purposes it is enough to say that in these debates the differences of
view as to the precise object or objects of intervention contemplated by
Article 62 and as to the need for a jurisdictional link with the parties to the
case still remained to be decided. At the same time, it seems to have been
assumed that a State permitted to intervene under Article 62 would
become a “party” to the case. That was only to be expected as the English
text of Article 62 then spoke specifically of permission to intervene “as a
third party”.

25. When the present Statute was drafted, a change was made in the
English text of paragraph 1 of Article 62 : the words “as a third party”,
which had no corresponding expression in the French text, were omitted.
This was done in the Committee of Jurists responsible for preparing the
new Statute on the basis of a proposal from its drafting committee which
considered the phrase to be “misleading”. The Rapporteur of the Com-
mittee at the same time underlined in his report that no change had been
found necessary in the French text and that the elimination of the phrase
“as a third party” from the English text was not intended to “change the
sense thereof”.

26. The present Court was first led to address itself to the problems of
intervention in 1951 in the context of Article 63 of the Statute when Cuba,
as a party to the Havana Convention of 1928 on Asylum, filed a decla-
ration of intervention in the Haya de la Torre case (I.C.J. Reports 1951, pp.
74, 76-77). In that case the Court stressed that, under Article 63, inter-
vention by a party to a convention the construction of which is in issue in
the proceedings is a matter of right. At the same time, however, it also
underlined that the right to intervene under Article 63 is confined to the
point of interpretation which is in issue in the proceedings, and does not
extend to general intervention in the case. Intervention under Article 62 of
the Statute was brought briefly, if very indirectly, to the Court’s notice
three years later in the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed from Rome
in 1943 (I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32). Subsequently, these and other prob-
lems involved in the application of Articles 62 and 63 of the Statute were



studied within the Court and its Committee for the Revision of the Rules of
Court.

27. In 1974 one of the fundamental questions raised in connection with
Article 62 — the question whether or not a link of jurisdiction with the
parties to the case is necessary — was directly raised when Fiji applied for
permission to intervene in the Nuclear Tests cases. These cases having
become moot, the court did not itself make any pronouncement on that
aspect of Fiji’s application for permission to intervene under Article 62. A
number of Judges, on the other hand, drew attention to it in declarations
appended to the Court’s Orders in the matter (7.C.J. Reports 1974, pp. 530,
535) emphasizing its importance. Afterwards, on the completion in 1978 of
the revision of the Rules, the Court introduced, in Article 81, paragraph 2,
thereof, a new subparagraph (c) requiring an application for permission to
intervene under Article 62 of the Statute to specify : “any basis of juris-
diction which is claimed to exist as between the State applying to intervene
and the parties to the case”. This it did in order to ensure that, when the
question did arise in a concrete case, it would be in possession of all the
elements which might be necessary for its decision. At the same time the
Court left any question with which it might in future be confronted in
regard to intervention to be decided on the basis of the Statute and in the
light of the particular circumstances of each case. Accordingly, it is on the
basis of the applicable provisions of the Statute and in the light of the
particular circumstances of the present case that the Court will now
examine whether the interest of a legal nature in the case invoked by Malta
and the stated object of Malta’s intervention are such as to justify the
granting of its request for permission to intervene.

*

28. The Court has earlier in this Judgment (paragraphs 13, 14, 19 and
20) set out the contentions by which Malta seeks to justify its request for
permission to intervene in the present case between Tunisia and Libya. As
appears from that summary, the interest of a legal nature which Malta
invokes consists essentially in its possible concern with any findings of the
Court, identifying and assessing the relevance of local or regional, geo-
graphical or geomorphological factors in the delimitation of the Libya/
Tunisia continental shelf, and with any pronouncements made by the
Court regarding, for example, the significance of special circumstances or
the application of equitable principles in that delimitation. Any such
findings or pronouncements, in Malta’s view, are certain or likely to affect
or have repercussions upon Malta’s own rights and legal interests in the
continental shelf, whenever there may be similarities or analogies between
their basic factors and those of the rights and legal interests on which the
Court has pronounced. Malta points to a number of specific geographical
and geomorphological features as possible subjects of findings or pro-
nouncements of the Court which might have repercussions on Malta’s legal
interest in regard to the continental shelf ; and it maintains that, given the



particular geography of the area, Malta would have a continental shelf
boundary with both Libya and Tunisia and that the boundaries between all
three States would converge at a single, as yet undetermined, point.

29. Thus, what Malta fears is that in its decision in the present case the
reasoning of the Court regarding particular geographical and geomorpho-
logical factors, special circumstances or the application of equitable prin-
ciples may afterwards have a prejudicial effect on Malta’s own legal
interests in future settlement of its own continental shelf boundaries with
Libya and Tunisia. At the hearing Malta underlined that it is only elements
in the Tunisia/ Libya case of such a kind that are the object of its request for
permission to intervene, and also that it is not concerned with the choice of
the particular line to delimit the boundary as between those two countries.
It further underlined that it is not concerned with the laying down of
general principles by the Court as between Libya and Tunisia.

30. In order to determine the precise implications of Malta’s request for
permission to intervene, the Court must have regard to the description
which has been given by Malta of the nature of its legal interest and the
object of its intervention. The Court notes that Malta does not base its
request for permission to intervene simply on an interest in the Court’s
pronouncements in the case regarding the applicable general principles
and rules of international law. In its Application and at the hearing Malta
has laid heavy emphasis on the fact that it bases its request on quite specific
elements in the Tunisia/ Libya case. It described these elements in its
Application only in general terms, and then gave the following as examples
of what it has in mind :

“(1) the question of the particular factors, equitable or other, which
determine the character of boundaries in the seabed bordered by
Libya, Tunisia and Malta ;

(2) the question of whether equidistance as a principle or method of
delimitation gives effect to such factors in accordance with
international law ;

(3) the effect of any geomorphic features of the relevant seabed
areas that separate Malta from the African coasts ;

(4) the question of applicable base-lines, including bay-closing
lines ;

(5) the question of whether there is a concept of coastline propor-
tionality which a State may validly invoke as a method of
delimiting its seabed boundaries with other States”.

These specific elements on which Malta bases its request were further
particularized at the hearing, when its Counsel spelt them out for the Court
point by point. Coast by coast, bay by bay, island by island, sea area by sea
area, Counsel for Malta indicated local and regional factors which it
claimed as having possible relevance in determining the continental shelf



boundaries of the States concerned. He also referred to various drilling
concessions that have been granted in the region, and to correspondence
between Malta and Libya and Malta and Tunisia regarding their respec-
tive continental shelf claims. He further referred to the existence of a
Special Agreement between Libya and Malta for the purpose of bringing
their differences concerning their continental shelf claims before the
Court, which now remains to be notified to the Court.

31. Malta thus makes it plain that the legal interest which it alleges and
on the basis of which it seeks to justify its request for permission to
intervene would concern matters which are, or may be, directly in issue
between the Parties in the Tunisia/ Libya case. These matters, as Malta
presents them, are part of the very subject-matter of the present case. Yet,
Malta has at the same time made it plain that it is not the object of its
intervention to submit its own interest in those matters for decision as
between itself and Libya or as between itself and Tunisia now in that case.
In its Application and at the hearing, as has already been stated, Malta
underlined that it is not its object “by way, or in the course, of intervention
in the Libya/ Tunisia case, to obtain any form of ruling or decision from the
Court concerning its continental shelf boundaries with either or both of
those countries”. However, even while thus disavowing any intention of
putting its own rights in issue in the present case, Malta emphasized that its
“object and interest in intervening does relate to the general area in which
those two States also claim continental shelf rights”. In short, Malta’s
position in its argument before the Court assumes existing rights of Malta
to areas of continental shelf opposable to the claims of the two States
Parties to the dispute before the Court. In effect, therefore, Malta in its
request is asking the Court to give a decision in the case between Tunisia
and Libya which in some measure would prejudge the merits of Malta’s
own claims against Tunisia and against Libya in its separate disputes with
each of those States.

32. Thus, the intervention for which Malta seeks permission from the
Court would allow Malta to submit arguments to the Court upon concrete
issues forming an essential part of the case between Tunisia and Libya.
Malta would moreover do so, not objectively as a kind of amicus curiae, but
as a closely interested participant in the proceedings intent upon seeing
those issues resolved in the manner most favourable to Malta. Nor would it
be the object of Malta’s intervention at the same time to submit its own
legal interest in the subject-matter of the case for decision as between itself
and Libya or as between itself and Tunisia in the present proceedings.
Malta, in short, seeks permission to enter into the proceedings in the case
but to do so without assuming the obligations of a party to the case within
the meaning of the Statute, and in particular of Article 59 under which the
decision in the case would hereafter be binding upon Malta in its relations
with Libya and Tunisia. If in the present Application Malta were seeking
permission to submit its own legal interest in the subject-matter of the case
for decision by the Court, and to become a party to the case, another



question would clearly call for the Court’s immediate consideration. That
is the question mentioned in the Nuclear Tests cases, whether a link of
jurisdiction with the parties to the case is a necessary condition of a grant of
permission to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute. Indeed, it was
suggested by Libya and Tunisia that the limit placed by Malta on the
object of its intervention is to be explained by its desire to avoid, or mini-
mize, the question of a need for a jurisdictional link with the Parties.

33. Clearly, as Malta asserts, it has a certain interest in the Court’s
treatment of the physical factors and legal considerations relevant to the
delimitation of the continental shelf boundaries of States within the central
Mediterranean region that is somewhat more specific and direct than that
of States outside that region. Even so, Malta’s interest is of the same kind as
the interests of other States within the region. But what Malta has to show
in order to obtain permission to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute is
an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the Court’s decision
in the present case between Tunisia and Libya. This case has been brought
before the Court by a Special Agreement between those two countries
under which the Court is requested to decide what are the principles and
rules of international law which may be applied and to indicate the prac-
tical way to apply them in the delimitation of the areas of continental shelf
appertaining to Libya and Tunisia. That is the case before the Court and it
is one in which Tunisia and Libya put in issue their claims with respect to
the matters covered by the Special Agreement. Accordingly, having regard
to the terms of Article 59 of the Statute, the Court’s decision in the case will
certainly be binding upon Tunisia and Libya with respect to those matters.
Malta now requests permission to intervene on the assumption that it has
an interest of a legal nature that is in issue in the proceedings in that case. It
seeks permission to submit its views with respect to the applicable prin-
ciples and rules of international law, not merely from the point of view of
their operation as between Libya and Tunisia but also of their operation as
between those States and Malta itself. Yet Malta attaches to its request an
express reservation that its intervention is not to have the effect of putting
in issue its own claims with regard to those same matters vis-à-vis Libya and
Tunisia. This being so, the very character of the intervention for which
Malta seeks permission shows, in the view of the Court, that the interest of a
legal nature invoked by Malta cannot be considered to be one “which may
be affected by the decision in the case” within the meaning of Article 62 of
the Statute.

34. Likewise, it does not appear to the Court that the direct yet limited
form of participation in the subject-matter of the proceedings for which
Malta here seeks permission could properly be admitted as falling within
the terms of the intervention for which Article 62 of the Statute provides.
What Malta in effect seeks to secure by its application is the opportunity to
argue in the present case in favour of a decision in which the Court would
refrain from adopting and applying particular criteria that it might other-
wise consider appropriate for the delimitation of the continental shelf of
Libya and Tunisia. In short, it seeks an opportunity to submit arguments to



the Court with possibly prejudicial effects on the interests either of Libya
or of Tunisia in their mutual relations with one another. To allow such a
form of “intervention” would, in the particular circumstances of the
present case, also leave the Parties quite uncertain as to whether and how
far they should consider their own separate legal interests vis-a-vis Malta
as in effect constituting part of the subject-matter of the present case. A
State seeking to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute is, in the view of
the Court, clearly not entitled to place the parties to the case in such a
position, and this is the more so since it would not be submitting its own
claims to decision by the Court nor be exposing itself to counter-
claims.

35. Malta has voiced the preoccupations which it has regarding possible
implications for its own interests of the Court’s findings and pronounce-
ments on particular elements in the present case between Tunisia and
Libya. The Court understands those preoccupations ; even so, for the
reasons which have been set out in this Judgment, the request for permis-
sion to intervene is not one to which, under Article 62 of the Statute, the
Court may accede. The Court at the same time thinks it proper to state that
it has necessarily and at all times to be sensible of the limits of the
jurisdiction conferred upon it by its Statute and by the parties to the case
before it. The findings at which it arrives and the reasoning by which it
reaches those findings in the case between Tunisia and Libya will therefore
inevitably be directed exclusively to the matters submitted to the Court in
the Special Agreement concluded between those States and on which its
jurisdiction in the present case is based. It follows that no conclusions or
inferences may legitimately be drawn from those findings or that reasoning
with respect to rights or claims of other States not parties to the case.

36. Having reached the conclusion, for the reasons set out in the present
Judgment, that Malta’s request for permission to intervene is in any event
not one to which it can accede, the Court finds it unnecessary to decide in
the present case the question whether the existence of a valid link of
jurisdiction with the parties to the case is an essential condition for the
granting of permission to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute.

37. For these reasons,
THE COURT,

Unanimously,

Finds that the Application of the Republic of Malta, filed in the Registry
of the Court on 30 January 1981, for permission to intervene in the pro-
ceedings under Article 62 of the Statute of the Court, cannot be
granted.
