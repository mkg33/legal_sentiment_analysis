                         The disputed building acquired the status of “premises of the mission” of
                      Equatorial Guinea within the meaning of Article 1 (i) of the Vienna Convention on
                      Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) on 27 July 2012 when Equatorial Guinea effect­
                      ively moved its mission into that building — With effect from that date, France
                      had an obligation to extend to the disputed building the protection guaranteed
                      under Article 22 of the VCDR — Under the VCDR, ownership of a building is
                      immaterial in determining whether it is capable of forming part of the premises of
                      a mission — France’s refusal to recognize the disputed building as premises of
                      Equatorial Guinea’s mission after 27 July 2012 was based on factors to do with the
                      ownership of the building rather than its use by the Applicant for purposes other
                      than its mission — The evidence regarding the prerequisite for consent of a
                      receiving State before a building can be recognized as premises of a mission points
                      to France’s practice of “no objection” whereby the receiving State will not
                      unreasonably object on grounds other than that the building is not being used for
                      the purposes of the mission stipulated in Article 3 of the VCDR — Since the
                      building only attained the status of “premises of the mission” on 27 July 2012, the
                      actions of French authorities in relation to that building before that date, including
                      searches, seizures and order of attachment (saisie pénale immobilière) cannot be
                      considered as being in violation of Article 22 of the VCDR — The order of
                      confiscation of the disputed building of 27 October 2017, confirmed on 10 February
                      2020, does not violate Article 22 of the VCDR since it concerns the transfer of
                      ownership of the building and does not necessarily implicate its use as premises of
                      Equatorial Guinea’s mission — There are no exceptional and compelling
                      circumstances pointing to abuse of rights by Equatorial Guinea and the Court
                      should have expressly said so in the Judgment.

                         1. I have voted against paragraph 126 (1) of the Judgment because I
                      disagree with the finding of the majority that the building at 42 avenue
                      Foch in Paris (hereinafter the “disputed building”) has never acquired the
                      status of “premises of the mission” of Equatorial Guinea within the
                      meaning of Article 1 (i) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Rela-
                      tions, 1961 (hereinafter the “VCDR” or the “Convention”). As I explain
                      in this opinion, the disputed building did acquire that status on 27 July
                      2012. Furthermore, although I have voted in favour of paragraph 126 (2)
                      along with the majority, I do so for reasons other than those expressed by

                      the majority in the Judgment. I express those reasons later on in this sep-
                      arate opinion. Lastly, while France argued at length about Equatorial
                      Guinea’s alleged “abuse of rights” in the present case, the Judgment says
                      little on the issue, simply alluding in paragraph 66 to the fact that the
                      purpose of the diplomatic privileges and immunities under the VCDR are
                      not meant to benefit individuals, without explaining how this statement
                      relates to Equatorial Guinea’s claims or conduct. I offer a few thoughts
                      on this issue in this separate opinion. But first I wish to remind the reader
                      of what the Court found, in 2018, to be the dispute between the Parties in
                      the present case.

                         5. In my view, the Court should have distinguished the question of
                      ownership of the disputed building from its assignment and use as prem-
                      ises of the mission and should have entertained Equatorial Guinea’s
                      Application only in so far as it concerns the status of the disputed build-

                      ing as “premises of the mission”. This is because under Article 1 (i) of the
                      VCDR, ownership is not a prerequisite for determining whether a build-
                      ing qualifies for protection under Article 22 of the VCDR as “premises of
                      the mission”. The only prerequisite thereunder is that the building, or
                      parts thereof and the land ancillary thereto, are “used for the purposes of
                      the mission including the residence of the head of mission”. In that regard,
                      I do not agree with the Court’s interpretation of Article 1 (i) of the
                      VCDR in paragraph 62. In my view, that provision is more than a mere
                      definition. In the ordinary meaning of that paragraph, the “premises of
                      the mission” comprise:

                           7. In determining whether the disputed building qualifies as “premises
                      of the mission” of Equatorial Guinea within the meaning of Article 1 (i)
                      of the VCDR, the Court has to determine, first, if and when Equatorial
                      Guinea started using the building for purposes of its mission and,
                      ­secondly, whether such use is subject to the consent of France as the
                       re­ceiving State as a necessary prerequisite for extending the régime of
                       inviolability in respect of that building under Article 22 of the VCDR.
                           8. In determining if and when the disputed building qualifies as “prem-
                       ises of the mission”, I have examined three possible dates on which
                       ­Equatorial Guinea claims the building was assigned for use as the prem-
                        ises of its mission, namely 4 October 2011, 17 October 2011 and 27 July
                        2012.

                        9. Equatorial Guinea refers to 4 October 2011, the day following the
                      search of the disputed building and seizure by French authorities of sev-
                      eral luxury vehicles belonging to Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue

                      from parking lots located near the disputed building on 3 October 2011,
                      as the date when it first assigned the disputed building for use as its dip-
                      lomatic mission. On that date, Equatorial Guinea officially notified the
                      French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the first time, that

                           “Equatorial Guinea . . . has for a number of years had at its disposal
                           a building located at 42 avenue Foch, Paris (16th arr.), which it uses
                           for the performance of its diplomatic functions, a fact which it has
                           hitherto not formally notified to your [Protocol] Department. 

                              Since the building forms part of the premises of the mission, pur-
                           suant to Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
                           of 18 April 1961, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to give
                           you official notification so that the French State can ensure the pro-
                           tection of those premises, in accordance with Article 22 of the said
                           Convention.” 4
                        10. In my view, however, Equatorial Guinea has not adduced sufficient
                      proof that the disputed building was, prior to or with effect from 4 Octo-
                      ber 2011, actually used as premises of its mission within the meaning of
                      Article 1 (i) of the VCDR. It is not sufficient that Equatorial Guinea
                      merely “had the disputed building at its disposal”. In that regard, I have
                      taken the following factors into account:

                      (a) First, according to Equatorial Guinea itself, the disputed building
                          belonged to Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue in his private
                          capacity until 15 September 2011 (one month before the above offi-
                          cial notification) when he allegedly transferred his shares in the five
                          Swiss companies to the Government of Equatorial Guinea. In those
                          circumstances, it is unlikely that the State of Equatorial Guinea had
                          “had the building at its disposal for a number of years” or that it used
                          the p­ rivately owned building “for the performance of its diplomatic
                          functions” prior to 4 October 2011, as alleged in their official
                          ­
                          notification.

                          ­allegedly, been transferred to the Government of Equatorial Guinea.
                           The first time a complaint was ever raised in this regard was by
                           Ms Mariola Bindang Obiang (UNESCO Representative) in respect
                           of the searches and seizures of 14‑23 February 2012 6.
                      (d) Fourthly, on‑site inspections of the disputed building carried out by
                          French authorities on 5 October 2011 and in February 2012 found no
                          evidence that it was either occupied by the Embassy of Equatorial
                          Guinea, or used as a residence by Ms Bindang Obiang, UNESCO
                          Representative 7. All they found was a signpost at the entrance
                           reading: “Republic of Equatorial Guinea — Embassy Premises”.
                           ­
                           Equatorial Guinea itself recognizes that the items seized by the
                           French Authorities on those occasions did not belong to its mission 8.
                        11. For all the above reasons, I am not convinced that the disputed
                      building acquired the status of “premises of the mission” within the mean-
                      ing of Article 1 (i) of the VCDR on or about 4 October 2011.

                      the Republic of Equatorial Guinea” 9. France responded on 31 October
                      2011, rejecting the appointment of Ms Bindang Obiang as Chargée
                      d’affaires ad interim as being contrary to Article 19 of the VCDR 10; insist-
                      ing that France had never recognized the disputed building as part of the
                      premises of Equatorial Guinea’s mission; and indicating that any change
                      in address of Ms Obiang’s residence from 46 rue des Belles Feuilles, Paris
                      (16th arr.) to the disputed building should be officially notified by
                      ­UNESCO’s protocol department and not by the Applicant’s Embassy 11.

                           Host Agreement between France and UNESCO requires that the
                           notification of such change of address should have been sent by the
                           protocol department of UNESCO to the French Ministry of Foreign
                           Affairs and not by the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea. In any event
                           that notification only took place four months later on 15 February
                           2012 15.
                      (c) Thirdly, approximately four months after Ms Mariola Bindang
                          Obiang had allegedly moved into the disputed building, French
                          authorities carried out several searches of the disputed building
                          between 14 and 23 February 2012 and seized various items compris-
                           ing the personal effects, furniture and documents of Mr. Teodoro
                           Obiang Mangue 16. Based on those searches and the testimony of
                          employees of Mr. Teodoro Obiang Mangue, there were neither
                          ­diplomatic documents nor property or items belonging to a female
                           resident found in the disputed building, despite a formal protest by
                           Equatorial Guinea and Ms Bindang Obiang against the searches 17.
                        16. For all the above reasons, Equatorial Guinea has not proved that
                      the disputed building acquired the status of “premises of the mission”
                      within the meaning of Article 1 (i) of the VCDR on or about 17 October
                      2011.
                      (iii) Move of Equatorial Guinea’s Embassy offices to the disputed building
                             on 27 July 2012
                         17. On 19 July 2012, the Paris Tribunal de grande instance issued an
                      order (saisie pénale immobilière) attaching the disputed building with a
                      view to its confiscation 18. On 27 July 2012, the Embassy of Equatorial

                      as premises of Equatorial Guinea’s mission was clearly based on the fact

                      that the disputed building was privately owned and has been placed under
                      an order of attachment and confiscation. Each Party is thus entrenched in
                      its position, except in 2015 when on a few occasions French authorities
                      obtained their visas to Equatorial Guinea and gave protection to diplo-
                      matic staff at that building.


                          22. In my view, there is sufficient evidence to show that the disputed
                      building has since 27 July 2012 been effectively used as premises of
                      ­Equatorial Guinea’s mission. In my view, although the orders of attach-
                       ment and confiscation could ultimately affect ownership of the disputed
                       building, they should not, at this stage, prevent Equatorial Guinea from
                       effectively using the building as premises of its mission. As earlier pointed
                       out, France itself admits that the ownership of the disputed building is
                       immaterial in determining whether the property is capable of forming
                       part of the premises of Equatorial Guinea’s mission 24.


                                       B. Is Prior Consent of the Receiving State
                                               a Necessary Prerequisite?
                         23. The VCDR is silent on whether the consent of the receiving State
                      is required before a building can qualify as “premises of a mission”. By
                      contrast for example, Article 11 speaks of agreement between the sending
                      and receiving States as to the size of the mission; while Article 12 forbids
                      a sending State from establishing additional offices of its mission
                      “in localities other than those in which the mission itself is established”.
                      The travaux préparatoires of the VCDR does not shed light on this issue.
                      The answer may lie in the practice of France, as receiving State, towards
                      all sending States that establish diplomatic relations with it.


                         24. The Parties are agreed that France has no written laws or guidelines
                      requiring prior consent. However, its practice appears to indicate the exis-
                      tence of a practice of a “no‑objection” régime. In other words, for purposes
                      of establishing premises of a diplomatic mission, it is enough for the send-
                      ing State to notify France as the receiving State of the location of the mis-
                      sion premises and for the latter to raise no objection thereto. It is also
                      expected that the receiving State will not unreasonably object, on grounds
                      other than that the building is not being used for the purpose of the mis-
                      sion. This approach has been adopted by commentators of the Convention:
                             “In States where no specific domestic legal framework controls the
                           acquisition or disposal of mission premises, the definition of Arti-
