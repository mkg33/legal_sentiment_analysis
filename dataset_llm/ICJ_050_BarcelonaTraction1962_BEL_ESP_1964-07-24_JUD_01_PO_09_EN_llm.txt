It is for the Court to construe this legal act. It is proper that this
act should be interpreted by the organ from which it emanates.

The discontinuance in question is a judicial contract the subject of
which must be determined with precision. It exists only in respect
of the point which formed the subject of the agreement between the
parties. Its scope must remain limited to what they intended. The
proposal to discontinue was agreed to by the Respondent Party. An
agreement between the Parties thus came into being. Paragraph 2
of Article 6g of the Rules of Court implies the reaching of an agreement
and, in the act effected, there must be seen a judicial contract which,
of course, is binding on the two Parties.

Article 30 of the Statute of the Court authorizes the Court to frame
rules for carrying out its functions and, in particular, to lay down rules
of procedure.

An international organ is given the power of creating rules of law,
in full independence. If international law is based on the agreement
of States, either express or tacit, in the case of Article 30 of the Statute
a new creative source has arisen. The Permanent Court and the Inter-
national Court, which were created by States, have the capacity to
lay down mandatory rules of law in the same way as any national
legislature.



It has been rightly held that the Rules of Court have the force of
an international convention binding upon all States but that, by the
will of the same States, these Rules can be modified or abrogated by
the Court. In Article 31 of the Rules the Court provides that the
parties may jointly ask it to make particular modifications or additions
to Sections 1, 2 and 4 of heading II of the Rules. The heading Setile-
ment and Discontinuance is to be found in Section 1 and Articles 68 and
69 could therefore have been modified or supplemented by agreement
between the Parties to the present case, with the Court’s consent.

To understand the scope and significance of Articles 68 and 69 of
the Rules, it is indispensable to examine the sources of these two
provisions.

Article 68 is a remodelling of Article 61 of the 1922 Rules. The
origin of that Article 61 is to be found in the work of the Permanent
Court between January and March 1922, when it was drawing up the
first Rules of that Court.

The Permanent Court first examin:d a questionnaire on the points
to be dealt with in the draft of the first Rules. One of the points in
that questionnaire was the following : Can the parties remove a case
from the Court, once they have submitted it? (P.C.I.J., Series D,
No. 2, p. 291.) A first Article, numbered 44 (given in Annex 21 (b),
at p. 304), gave, in its first and second paragraphs, an answer to that
question. This text, which relates to numbers 63 and 64, was adopted
(p. 154) and appeared finally in the first Rules as Article 61.

The discussion of the questionnaire (pp. 83 and 84) made it clear,
according to Judge Anzilotti, that the Court’s jurisdiction was based
entirely on the will of the parties and that for that reason the wishes
of the parties should in all circumstances prevail. Lord Finlay added
that it was agreed that the parties should have the right to withdraw,
by common consent, a suit which they had brought before the Court.

The original Article 61, now Article 68, covered two cases: that of
an agreement between the parties as to the settlement of the dispute
and that of an agreement between the parties not to go on with the
proceedings, that is to say, to withdraw the case from the Court. In
both events, it was laid down that the case should be removed from
the list. For the authors of that original Article 61, if discontinuance
was effected by common consent of the parties, the withdrawal of the
case from the Court was concluded. This decision not to go on with
the proceedings was equivalent to withdrawing the case from the
Court. ...

Baron Rolin-Jaequemyns is reported in these minutes as thinking

IIS

BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 118

that if “a government had noted the other government’s declaration of
withdrawal, the result of this was to constitute an agreement between
the parties, so that Article 61 was applicable”. The Registrar then
recalled that Article 68 had been applied in two cases submitted by
unilateral application, the Szwo-Belgian and Chorzéw cases.

The discussion ended with a statement by Sir Cecil Hurst to the effect
that :

“if the parties were agreed to remove a case from the Court, the
latter’s jurisdiction ceased and there was not even anything to
make an order upon, since the Court’s jurisdiction was derived
exclusively from the agreement between the parties”.

In his view,

“withdrawal by the applicant did not suffice by itself to put an end
to the jurisdiction of the Court ; for that purpose it must be accom-
panied by the consent of the other party. He thought that
Article 61 of the Rules, which only dealt with the case of an agree-
ment between the parties, did not cover the present case.”

The aim of the 1936 reform, in framing paragraph 2 of Article 69,

paragraph 2 of Article 6g was to embody a previously existing practice
in a provision of the Rules.

Far from making provision for discontinuance of the proceedings,
it adopted a discontinuance which, if accepted by the other party,
creates an agreement to put an end to the proceedings. In such a
case, paragraph 2 of Article 69 has the same legal content as the dis-
continuance by mutual agreement provided for in Article 68, formerly
Article 61 of the old Rules, which, according to Sir Cecil Hurst, had
the final result of bringing jurisdiction to an end.

Paragraph 2 of Article 69, moreover, did not introduce the right to
re-submit the application ; jurisdiction having come to an end, such a
right was inconceivable. In order that such a right might be exercised,
it would have had to be based on a provision of the Rules which they
do not contain.

*

When the Court is seised of a dispute, such dispute may be terminated
by a judgment, but there are other means for putting an end to suits
before the Court. It is provided in Article 20, paragraph 2, of the
Rules, under heading XVIII, that the nature of the result of a suit shall
be stated and its immediate effect can only be its removal from the
list. As soon as an order has been made removing a case from the list,
this means that the case has a final result.

Discontinuance, as provided for in Articles 68 and 69 of the Rules},
opens another possibility for obtaining the removal of a case from the
list. These two Articles come together under the heading Settlement
and Discontinuance ; these two situations are related to each other.

Under Article 68, parties can agree as to the resolution of the dispute,
either by means of a settlement or by not going on with the proceedings.
In both cases, the will of the parties puts an end to the suit, and the
Court places on record the agreement or the discontinuance and orders
the case to be removed from the list on a mere communication from

1 Article 68

If at any time before judgment has been delivered, the parties conclude an
agreement as to the settlement of the dispute and so inform the Court in writing,
or by mutual agreement inform the Court in writing that they are not going on
with the proceedings, the Court, or the President if the Court is not sitting, shall
make an order officially recording the conclusion of the settlement or the discon-
tinuance of the proceedings; in either case the order shall direct the removal of
the case from the list.

Article 69

1. If in the course of proceedings instituted by means of an application, the
applicant informs the Court in writing that it is not going on with the proceedings,

The principle of the equality of the parties to a suit is indeed a prin-
ciple laid down in Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute, in the pro-
vision of the Rules and in the case-law of the Court. The International
Court of Justice, in its Advisory Opinion on Judgments of the Adminis-
trative Tribunal of the I.L.O. (I.C.J. Reports 1956) said (at p. 86):
“The principle of equality of the parties follows from the requirements
of good administration of justice.” Discontinuance of the proceedings,
in itself, obviously favours the applicant, allowing it to correct the
mistakes contained in the first application when re-submitting a new
one. This was recognized by the Belgian Government in its Obser-
vations. It had to take account of the criticism which the first Appli-
cation had given rise to on the part of the Spanish Government. If
the text which notifies the discontinuance doés not clearly state that
it is a discontinuance of the proceedings which is involved, the party
which wishes to give it such an effect must make clear without ambi-
guities its intentions and the purport of its notice of discontinuance.
It is in duty bound to do so. The respondent is thereby informed of
the discontinuing party's intention so that it can consent to or refuse
the discontinuance with a full knowledge of what is involved.

history of the conversations between the two private groups must be

I20

BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 123

made clear. It is only thereafter that it will be possible to judge the
value and the relevance of this evidence.

The notice of discontinuance cannot be situated in a void. It can
be conceived of and understood only in the context of the conversations
and discussions which gave rise to it. It is in the light of these facts
and of the acts of those concerned that it must be read and interpreted.
There is a sequence which links them with their culmination. The
relationship which is established between them discloses the purpose
of and the reason for the discontinuance. These various facts and
acts, which form the context of the discontinuance, are bound together
by a logical correlation. They explain one another. All these factors
influenced the drafting of the notice of discontinuance, and it must
be considered in relation to the circumstances in which it was filed
and submitted for the decision of the other Party. These conversations
started between Sidro and Fecsa, with Count de Motrico as an inter-
mediary chosen by the two groups. They continued between Sidro
and the Belgian Government and, finally, the text of the notice was
communicated to the Spanish Government. The conversations which
began in October 1960 ended in April 1961.

This Preliminary Objection is concerned with tne jurisdiction of the
Court.

The Application instituting proceedings states that the Treaty of
19 July 1927, which came into force on 23 May 1928, is binding on
Spain and Belgium. Pursuant to Article 17 of that Treaty, these
States may bring direct before the Permanent Court of International
Justice, by means of an application, disputes with regard to which the
parties are in conflict as to their respective rights. This Treaty being
in force, according to Article 37 of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice it is to this Court that the jurisdiction provided for
in favour of the Permanent Court is transferred. As Belgium and
Spain are parties to the Statute of the International Court it is claimed
that this Court possesses jurisdiction to hear and decide the present
dispute.

In its Submissions, the Spanish Government states that the bond of
jurisdiction provided for in Article 17 applies to the submission of
disputes, not to the International Court but only to the Permanent
Court. The admission of Spain to the United Nations, in 1955, did
not have the effect of substituting the compulsory jurisdiction of the
International Court for that of the Permanent Court, for the Permanent
Court was dissolved before Spain was admitted as a Member of the
United Nations. This situation was not modified by Article 37 of the
Statute, which binds only States that were Members of the United
Nations prior to the dissolution of the Permanent Court. The Court
is therefore without jurisdiction.

The Belgian Government maintains that the interpretation given in
the Judgment of 26 May 1959 in the Aerial Incident case (I.C.J. Reports
1959, p. 127), although valid and correct in respect of Article 36,
paragraph 5!, is not applicable as an interpretation of Article 372.

1 Article 36, para. 5:

“5. Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court
of International Justice and which are still in force shall be deemed, as between
the parties to the present Statute, to be acceptances of the compulsory jurisdiction
of the International Court of Justice for the period which they still have to run
and in accordance with their terms.”

? Article 37 :

“Whenever a treaty or convention in force provides for reference of a matter
to a tribunal to have been instituted by the League of Nations, or to the Perma-
nent Court of International Justice, the matter shall, as between the parties to
the present Statute, be referred to the International Court of Justice.”


BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 135

The interpretation given in this Judgment was followed in the Temple
of Preah Vihear Judgment of 26 May 1961 (I.C.J. Reports 1961, p. 17).
In the Judgment in the Aerial Incident case, the Court made no
mention of Article 37 in order not to prejudge the case on the first
Application relating to Barcelona Traction which was then pending.
It must therefore be shown why that interpretation is not applicable
with regard to Article 37. For this purpose, it must be shown that the
question raised by Article 36, paragraph 5, is a different question
from that raised by Article 37. In the absence of such proof, the
decision in the Aerial Incident case would be applicable and the Belgian
contention must be abandoned. It is only the legal differences between
these two texts that concern us. Factual differences between the
present case and that of the Aerial Incident are of less importance, for
they have no bearing on the legal problem concerning the two texts.
The Belgian Government's central argument is to the effect that,
from the legal standpoint, there is a difference between a declaration
under Article 36, paragraph 5, and a declaration of acceptance of
jurisdiction embodied in a treaty or convention (Article 37).

The legal nature of these two undertakings is identical and so is
their content. Their purpose is to make the jurisdiction of the Court
compulsory for the States (the same content) and they are also con-
sensual undertakings (the same nature). They may or may not be

interpreted it, can no longer be applied. The same will in future be
true of Article 37.

If the Statute had been set out with a more technical presentation,
these two provisions would have been inserted at the end of it, under
the heading “Transitional Provisions”. This method was not adopted,


BARCELONA TRACTION (DIss. OP. ARMAND-UGON) I4I

no doubt in order to preserve the same numbering of the articles in
the two Statutes. The transitional provisions mentioned were inserted
where they would not entail changes in the numbering.

Furthermore, account must be taken of the effects of the dissolution
of the Permanent Court on the 1927 Treaty and on its jurisdictional
clause.


The 1927 Treaty, in fact, in its Articles 1 and 2 and in the Final
Protocol, is concerned with disputes that “may arise” between the two
States. It cannot be said that the Spanish-Belgian Treaty indicates


BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 162

any clear intention to cover all disputes. The jurisdictional clause
of Article 17 of the Treaty—paragraph 4, which Article 37 of the Statute
revives—does not apply to any disputes whatsoever, but only to dis-
putes which are subsequent to the date of 14 December 1955. For
disputes prior to that date, there is no applicable jurisdictional clause.
The present dispute arose much earlier than 14 December 1955, as is
admitted by the Belgian Government in its diplomatic Note of 16 May
1957. It is clear therefore that Article 37 could not make the effect
of the jurisdictional clause of Article 17 retrospectively applicable to
disputes that arose prior to its coming into force. The Permanent
Court said :

“Not only are the terms expressing the limitation ratione tem-
poris clear, but the intention which inspired it seems equally elear :
it was inserted with the object of depriving the acceptance of the
compulsory jurisdiction of any retroactive effects” (P.C.I.J.,
Series A |B, No. 74, p. 24).

On joinder to the merits four points should be borne in mind :

(1) The basis of international jurisdiction is not, as in municipal law,
the will of a law-maker, but the consent of the parties themselves.

(2) It is in the light of that fundamental observation that the effect
of the raising of a preliminary objection by the respondent State must
be judged. The respondent is thus exercising its right to have the
Court ascertain as a preliminary matter whether the case for which
the applicant has sought to bring it before the Court is or is not one of
those for which it has agreed that the Court should give a decision
where it is concerned. For that reason, when a preliminary objection
is raised, the proceedings on the merits are stopped and can. normally
be resumed only when the question raised as a preliminary objection
has been decided.

(3) It is always in the light of the basic observation made above


BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 164

under (1) that the question of the propriety of joining a preliminary
objection to the merits must be examined. As Judge Anzilotti remarked
(P.C.I.J., Series D, Third Addendum to No. 2, p. 647) :

“The joinder of an objection to the merits, which compelled a State
to appear before the Court, in spite of the fact that it claimed not to
have accepted any obligation to do so, was in international proceedings
an entirely different matter to the same step in proceedings at muni-
cipal law, in which the obligation to appear before a Court was not
dependent on the will of the party concerned.”

Thus, while it certainly cannot be said that the Court needs the
consent of the respondent in order to be able to join a preliminary
objection to the merits, it is none the less true that joinder to the merits
may be decided upon only as an absolutely exceptional step. It runs
manifestly counter to the respondent’s right not to have the merits of
a case discussed unless it has first of all been established that, in one
way or another, its consent has been given to the Court’s deciding the
case.

Thus the Court can resort to the joining of a preliminary objection
to the merits only :

(a) when the parties themselves request it, or

(b) when the question raised as a preliminary objection is so bound
up with the question which constitutes the merits of the case that
it is manifestly impossible to decide the one without deciding the
other at the same time.

(4) As regards the validity of such a conclusion, there can be no
difference whatever according to whether the question raised as a
preliminary objection is a purely procedural question or a question
which is in itself a question which touches upon substantive law. What
is necessary is that it should be a question separate from that which
constitutes the actual merits of the case. Many questions can be in
themselves questions of substance without on that account touching
on the merits of the case.

These four points should be borne particularly in mind when taking a
decision on the possibility of joining to the merits a question raised by
the respondent State as a preliminary objection. If joinder to the
merits were decided upon in a case where the question could have been
decided independently of the merits of the case, the Court would be
going against the very purpose of the institution of preliminary objec-
tions. It would be compelling the respondent to address itself to the
whole merits of a case in connection with which it might subsequently
have to hold that, in the end, the respondent had not at all been bound
to do so.


BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 165

In the Barcelona Traction case, there is nothing to warrant the sugges-
tion that the third and fourth objections should be joined to the merits.
The idea advanced during the hearings to the effect that in the present
situation the Court should first explore the circumstances of the case
which might affect the Belgian State’s jus standi, and take its decision
in relation to those circumstances, would be likely to lead to an absurd
situation. What is first necessary is to establish the rule governing
the matter. Consideration should then be given to the question
whether that rule ever contemplates the possibility, where prejudice
has been caused to a company by a foreign State, of diplomatic protec-
tion being exercised by a State other than the national State of the
company itself. If the Court comes to a negative conclusion, it should
quite simply declare that the Belgian State has no capacity to exercise
diplomatic protection in the Barcelona Traction case, whether it comes
forward as the protector of the allegedly injured company or whether
it seeks to act as the protector of the alleged Belgian shareholders of
the company. The circumstances of the particular case cannot in
any way modify this conclusion.

According to its terms of reference the Court must apply international
law. It must apply a rule of international law in order to decide ques-
tions which are raised as preliminary objections, whether it be the
question of the Belgian Government's lack of capacity or the question
of failure to exhaust local remedies. The very idea of a decision for
a particular case, such as seems to be suggested by the Belgian Govern-
ment, is inadmissible. Is it possible to conceive of the Court’s refrain-
ing from ascertaining the ruie of international law which relates to
questions under consideration and deciding those questions in themselves
without troubling to determine beforehand what rules must be applied?
Or, again, is it conceivable that after determining those rules it should
not apply them to the particular case? This would not be deciding
according to the circumstances of the particular case but inventing and
applying to it a rule different from that laid down by international
law and hence patently violating that rule.

It is moreover quite clear that the question of the Belgian Govern-
ment’s lack of capacity can be decided without going in any way into
the merits of the case. The merits of the case consist of the question
whether or not a Canadian company suffered a denial of justice in
Spain. Whether the answer to that question is in the affirmative or
in the negative cannot in any way affect the position to be taken on the
question whether or not the Belgian Government has capacity to inter-
vene in the case, either for the diplomatic protection of the company
or for the diplomatic protection of the company’s alleged Belgian share-
holders. Nor can it affect the position on the question whether or not
Sidro is a shareholder of Barcelona Traction.

The Belgian Government agreed, both at the time when it submitted
its draft special agreement to the Spanish Government, and later when,
after the Spanish Government's refusal, it notified it of the filing of


BARCELONA TRACTION (DISS. OP. ARMAND-UGON) 166

its unilateral application, that the question of the Belgian Government’s
capacity to take action in the case could and should be decided prior
to any consideration of the merits. It will be recalled that the Belgian
Government had even explicitly excluded that question from among
those on which a joinder to the merits might be contemplated. It is
not open to it now to take a view different from the one which it took
then. It cannot now claim that the question of the Belgian Govern-
ment’s capacity to take action cannot be disentangled from the merits
of the case, seeing that it asserted the contrary itself at the time of the
filing of the Application.

The two Governments are in agreement that the Court should decide
the question whether the second Application is similar to the first
(both are claimed to be concerned with protection of Barcelona Traction)
and the question whether entry in the company’s register is evidence
of the status of shareholder. These points, in the view of both Govern-
ments, should not be joined to the merits.

The same applies to the question of the exhaustion of local remedies.
Whether or not the adjudication in bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction
and its consequences constituted a denial of justice towards the com-
pany cannot alter the fact that the company itself, and the company
alone, was able and bound to make use in due time of the remedies
which the Spanish legal system made available to it for the purpose
of challenging the adjudication in bankruptcy. The company did not
do so and has therefore lost the right to complain, at the international
level, of a denial of justice which, if it had really existed, could have
been cured at the municipal le sel and was not so cured solely because
of its own negligence. There is nothing in this finding which could
be modified by investigation of the question whether or not the alleged
denial of justice existed, or whether or not the alleged Belgian share-
holders in the company sustained damage to their own interests as a
result of the prejudice sustained by the company. It is to the company
and to its directors who failed to take .appropriate steps to safeguard
the rights and interests of the company that the shareholders should
address their complaints, and not to the Spanish State which has never
had anything to do with them.

It is impossible to see how the Court could derive from an exami-
nation of the merits any element that might be of use for the purpose
of a decision on the preliminary objections concerning the Belgian
Government’s lack of capacity and the failure to exhaust local remedies,
Might not the joinder of these objections to the merits, in a case where
the questions with which they deal are manifestly separate from and
independent of the question which constitutes the merits of the case,
be regarded as a départure from the rules governing the procedure for
the examination of preliminary objections and, over and above those
rules, as a departure from the principles on which international juris-
diction itself is based?
