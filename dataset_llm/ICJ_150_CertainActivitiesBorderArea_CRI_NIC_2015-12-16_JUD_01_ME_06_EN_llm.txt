                         5. While I concur with the majority’s conclusion that Costa Rica ought
                      to have produced an EIA in the Construction of a Road case (Judgment,
                      paras. 104‑105 and 160‑162), I feel the present Judgment offers a welcome
                      opportunity to expand upon the present state of the law surrounding
                      EIAs, and to offer insight as to how the body of law governing such
                      instruments may be complemented so as to provide clearer guidance to
                      nation-States contemplating large‑scale public works projects that con-
                      tain a prospect of transboundary impacts.
                         6. As I shall discuss at greater length below, the obligation to produce
                      an EIA presently arises not only under general international law, but has
                      also been codified by various international treaties and other legal instru-
                      ments. Regrettably, despite the current widespread acceptance of the
                      necessity to conduct an EIA where there is a risk of transboundary harm,
                      public international law presently offers almost no guidance as to the spe-

                      cific circumstances giving rise to the need for an EIA, nor the requisite
                      content of any such assessment.

                         7. For these reasons, in the present opinion I intend to offer some sug-
                      gestions as to how the public international law standards governing EIAs
                      could be improved. In undertaking this endeavour, I draw inspiration
                      from the words of Judge Weeramantry in his dissenting opinion to this
                      Court’s Nuclear Tests II Order :

                               “This Court, situated as it is at the apex of international tribunals,
                            necessarily enjoys a position of special trust and responsibility in rela-
                            tion to the principles of environmental law, especially those relating
                            to what is described in environmental law as the Global Commons.
                            When a matter is brought before it which raises serious environmen-
                            tal issues of global importance, and a prima facie case is made out of
                            the possibility of environmental damage, the Court is entitled to take
                            into account the Environmental Impact Assessment principle in deter-
                            mining its preliminary approach.” 1

                         8. In keeping with this sage pronouncement, I shall first examine how
                      the legal instrument of an EIA fits within the broader history and con-
                      temporary régime of international environmental law. Against this back-
                      drop I shall proceed to a discussion of current trends in public international
                      law pertaining to transboundary EIAs. Finally, I shall provide some rec-
                      ommendations that in my respectful view could serve as useful minimum
                      standards for determining the content of transboundary EIAs under pub-
                      lic international law.

                         9. Over approximately the past half‑century remarkable progressive
                      steps have been taken with regard to international environmental law
                      since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was
                      held at Stockholm in 1972 (“Stockholm Conference”) 2. One of the rea-
                      sons for this evolution is scientific development, in so far as increased
                      technological capacity for scientific inquiry has heightened the ability of

                      mankind to ascertain the harm it is committing against its own natural
                      habitat. This is demonstrated most obviously through a greatly intensi-
                      fied focus on climate change over the past twenty years 3.
                         10. Some of the driving forces behind the advent and growing accep-
                      tance of the need to conduct EIAs are the concomitant rise in other inter-
                      national environmental law doctrines, such as the principle of sustainable
                      development, the principle of preventive action, global commons, the pre-
                      cautionary principle, the polluter pays principle and the concept of trans-
                      boundary harm.

                                            Principle of Sustainable Development
                         11. The principle of sustainable development has been a driving force
                      in international environmental law for several decades. Indeed, the Stock-
                      holm Conference culminated in the issuance of a comprehensive report
                      recognizing, inter alia, that environmental management is designed for
                      the purpose of facilitating comprehensive planning that takes into account
                      the side effects of human activities on the environment 4. Chapter I of that
                      report consisted of a declaration (“Stockholm Declaration”) containing
                      26 principles.
                         12. Principle 1 of the Stockholm Declaration implicitly embodied the
                      principle of sustainable development when it stated in relevant part that :
                               “Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate
                            conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life
                            of dignity and well‑being, and he bears a solemn responsibility to
                            protect and improve the environment for present and future genera-
                            tions.”
                      The actual term “sustainable development” was coined in a report pre-
                      pared in 1987 by the World Commission on Environment and Develop-
                      ment 5, commonly known as the “Brundtland Report” 6, and has figured
                      prominently in numerous international treaties, legal instruments and
                      cases applying international environmental law ever since.

                         13. The notion of sustainable development is said to embody the balan­
                      cing of two ideas. The first is the idea of granting priority to essential needs
                      such as food, clothing, shelter, and the second is the idea of limitations
                      imposed by the ability of the environment to meet such future needs 7.
                      As the term implies, the industrial development and scientific progress

                      taking place in the world must be done in a manner that takes into
                      account the impact of such activities on the environment. In fact, in the
                      Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project Judgment, this Court discussed this bal-
                      ancing act in the following terms :
                               “Throughout the ages, mankind has, for economic and other rea-
                            sons, constantly interfered with nature. In the past, this was often
                            done without consideration of the effects upon the environment.
                            Owing to new scientific insights and to a growing awareness of the
                            risks for mankind — for present and future generations — of pursuit
                            of such interventions at an unconsidered and unabated pace, new
                            norms and standards have been developed, set forth in a great number
                            of instruments during the last two decades. Such new norms have to
                            be taken into consideration, and such new standards given proper
                            weight, not only when States contemplate new activities but also when
                            continuing with activities begun in the past. This need to reconcile
                            economic development with protection of the environment is aptly
                            expressed in the concept of sustainable development.” 8


                      The principle of sustainable development is thought of as an underlying
                      concern in all negotiations and discussions of the international commu-
                      nity relating to the environment 9.

                                                Principle of Preventive Action
                         14. In addition to sustainable development, the principle of preventive
                      action is another pillar of modern international environmental law 10.
                      Whereas certain principles of international environmental law such as
                      sustainable development focus on balancing the often competing needs of
                      industrial development and environmental protection, the principle of
                      preventive action, by contrast, focuses solely on the minimization of envi-
                      ronmental damage 11. As the term would imply, the preventive action
                      called for must be done prior to the occurrence of any environmental
                      damage. This Court has recognized the importance of the principle of
                      preventive action in the Gabčíkovo‑Nagymaros Project Judgment, where
                      it stated that :
                            “[t]he Court is mindful that, in the field of environmental protection,

                         15. Central to the principles of sustainable development and preven-
                      tive action is the core idea of common custody over the earth’s resources
                      and that stewardship over the environment cannot end at the border of a

                      however, is captured by Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration :

                         18. There exists some confusion in the international community with
                      regard to this principle as it has been provided for in many conventions
                      though in different language. Certain conventions couch this principle in
                      terms similar to progressive realization of enhanced scientific capabilities
                      and available knowledge 18. This principle was urged before the Court by
                      New Zealand (as well as all five intervening nations) in Nuclear Tests II 19.
                      However, in that Order the Court did not make any finding as to the
                      applicability of the precautionary principle. Nearly two decades later, and
                      despite being urged by New Zealand as an intervening State, the Court
                      did not take into account the precautionary principle in its analysis d

                      of care. As the concept arose from the Organization for Economic
                      Co‑operation and Development (“OECD”) 25 and does not have the sta-
                      tus of a principle of general international law 26, it presently acts as merely
                      a general guideline of public international law 27.

                                                       Transboundary Harm
                        20. As the preceding discussion underscores, there are a variety of
                      overlapping principles when it comes to international environmental law,
                      with distinct approaches and objectives, that converge upon the com-


                         21. There exists no single definition of transboundary harm under
                      international law. Though the Draft Principles relating to prevention of
                      transboundary harm by the International Law Commission (“ILC”) 28 do
                      contain a definition of this concept, the idea of “risk of causing significant
                      transboundary harm” is quite vague. Harm as per the ILC must be phys-
                      ical and is limited to persons, property or the environment 29. However,


                               “For the purposes of these articles, ‘risk of causing significant trans-
                            boundary harm’ refers to the combined effect of the probability of
                            occurrence of an accident and the magnitude of its injurious impact.

                      The ILC also gives guidance on the meaning of the word “significant” by

                               ‘significant’ is something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the
                               level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’. The harm must lead to a real detri-
                               mental effect on matters such as, for example, human health, industry,
                               property, environment or agriculture in other States. Such detrimen-
                               tal effects must be susceptible of being measured by factual and objec-
                               tive standards.” 31
                         22. Transboundary harm has been succinctly described by this Court

                      harm must be a result of human activity ; secondly, the harm must result
                      as a consequence of that human activity ; thirdly, there must be trans-
                      boundary effects on a neighbouring nation-State ; and fourthly, the harm
                      must be significant or substantial 33.

                      law instruments 36.

                      the Rio Declaration 39 and a host of multilateral conventions 40.

                        25. For example, the Rio Declaration does not dictate the contents of
                      an EIA, but rather simply states that: “Environmental impact assessment,
                      as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that
                      are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are

                      elucidation as to the practical implications of this responsibility.
                         28. Finally, in the Pulp Mills Judgment of 2010, upon which the pres-
                      ent Judgment has placed considerable emphasis, this Court noted :

                            “a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance
                            among States that it may now be considered a requirement under
                            general international law to undertake an environmental impact

                            sidered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to
                            affect the régime of the river or the quality of its waters did not under-
                            take an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of
                            such works.

                            over, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout
                            the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the
                            environment shall be undertaken.” 46
                      However, in the same section of that Judgment, the Court opined that
                            “it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its
                            domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project,
                            the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required

                         29. Thus, we see that while the Pulp Mills Judgment elevated the prac-
                      tice of conducting an EIA to an imperative under general international
                      law when certain preconditions are met, at the same time it allowed for a
                      renvoi to domestic law in terms of the procedure and content required
                      when carrying out such an assessment. In view of the paucity of guidance

                         30. One reason for the lack of clarity as to what exactly a nation-State
                      must do under international law to discharge its burden of conducting an
                      EIA under these various authorities could be that the extent of the obliga-
                      tions arising under such instruments are difficult to define with precision.
                      Some have suggested that this lack of precision is attributable to the fact
                      that such assessments are a policy instrument 48. Whatever the reason, the
                      situation as it currently stands is less than ideal.


                         31. To discern the current state of the law on this point, one must
                      endeavour to assimilate the various international law instruments that
                      impose upon nation-States an obligation to conduct an EIA and synthe-
                      size the obligations imposed thereunder. Notwithstanding the lack of

                      transboundary harm. The first stage is to conduct a preliminary assess-
                      ment measuring the possibility of transboundary harm. In the present
                      case, we see the Court has looked at the magnitude of the road project
                      and local geographic conditions in assessing that a preliminary assess-
                      ment by Costa Rica was warranted as to the possibility of harm to the
                      San Juan River (Judgment, para. 155). If a preliminary assessment deter-
                      mines that there is a risk of significant transboundary harm, then the

                      and final stage of this process is that of post‑project assessment (ibid.,
                      para. 161). This is in keeping with the Court’s reasoning in the Pulp Mills
                      Judgment that “once operations have started and, where necessary,
                      throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on
                      the environment shall be undertaken” 49.

                      process. In attempt to fill this lacuna, the present opinion will offer sug-

                      for Europe (“UNECE”) provides, in my view, an exemplary standard for
                      the process to be followed when conducting an EIA. In making this state-
                      ment, I readily concede that the Espoo Convention is primarily a regional
                      instrument designed to regulate transboundary harm in a European con-
                      text. Because international law is grounded in the bedrock principle of
                      consent between sovereign nation-States, and bearing in mind that the
                      present case arises in the geopolitical context of Latin America, I am

                      nations, which reduces the probability of ratification 51.

                        33. Taking such valid criticism into account, but also noting that the
                      Espoo Convention contains a provision that allows for non‑European
                      nation-States to join it 52, I believe that it is helpful to consider the

                      boundary EIAs under public international law. If the international com-
                      munity were to come together for the purpose of putting in place a
                      convention dealing with transboundary EIAs, I propose that the
                      Espoo Convention would constitute a very useful starting-point.


                                        Espoo Convention : A Brief Overview


                        35. Article 2 (6) of the Convention places heavy emphasis on the need
                      for public participation of the likely affected population(s). The form that
                      this obligation takes under the Convention requires that the State propos-
                        50 UNTS, Vol. 1989, p. 309.

                      ing the project allow for the participation of not only its own affected
                      population but that of the potentially affected neighbouring State as well.
                      The notion that international law has begun to pay more attention to
                      individuals is demonstrated by the requirement of public participation 53.
                      This concept of public participation expands upon prior pronouncements

                         36. Article 3 of the Convention requires the nation proposing a project
                      to notify a potentially affected neighbouring nation-State regarding any
                      proposed activity that is likely to cause a “significant adverse transbound-
                      ary impact”. There is, naturally, great debate about the extent of the obli-
                      gation that this phrase entails. A country proposing a project might argue
                      that any impact is neither significant nor adverse, and thus escapes the
                      ambit of Article 3. In fact this seems to be a similar threshold provided

                      to be settled by an inquiry commission.
                         37. Article 5 of the Convention requires consultations with the affected
                      State, to give recommendations to the State of origin methods for the
                      reduction or the elimination of the harmful impact. This allows for a
                      more amicable settling of disputes and problems arising out of a particu-
