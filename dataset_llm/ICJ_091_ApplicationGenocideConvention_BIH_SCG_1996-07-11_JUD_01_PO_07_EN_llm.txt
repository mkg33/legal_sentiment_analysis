1. My approach to the meaning of the first preliminary objection is
essentially different from that of the Court. Prior to deciding whether in
concreto there is an international dispute within the terms of Article IX
of the Genocide Convention, it is necessary, in my opinion, to resolve the
dilemma of whether Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time when the Appli-
cation, as well as the Memorial, were submitted, and Bosnia and Herze-
govina as it exists today when this case is being heard, are actually one
and the same State. This question represents, in my opinion, a typical
example of what Judge Fitzmaurice in his separate opinion in the Norih-
ern Cameroons case! described as objections “which can and strictly
should be taken in advance of any question of competence”, for it opens
the way for the persona standi in judicio of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

If they are the same State, then the issue raised by the preliminary
objection is in order. In the event that they are not, the situation is in my
opinion clear — there is no dispute concerning Article IX of the Conven-
tion — hence, placitum aliud personale.

In this regard, the issue raised by the first preliminary objection is not
an issue of admissibility stricto sensu, but a mixture, in its own right, of
admissibility and jurisdiction ratione personae.

2. The aforementioned question is directly linked with the concept of
an international dispute, the substance of which consists of two cumula-
tive ¢lements — the material, and the formal. The generally accepted
definition of the dispute which the Court gave in the Mavrommatis Pal-
estine Concessions case” represents, in fact, only the material element of
the concept of “international dispute”. In order to qualify “a disagree-
ment over a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests”,
which is evident in this specific case, as an “international dispute”,
another, formal element is indispensable, 1.e., that the parties in the “dis-
agreement or conflict” be States in the sense of international public law.

Article IX of the Genocide Convention stipulates the competence of the
Court for the “disputes between the Parties”. The term “Parties”, as it
obviously results from Article XI of the Convention, means States, either
members or non-members of the United Nations.

The term “State” is not used either ir abstracto in the Genocide Con-
vention, or elsewhere; it means a concrete entity which combines in its
personality the constituting elements of a State, determined by the inter-
national law. The pretention of an entity to represent a State, and even
recognition by other States, is not, in the eyes of the law, sufficient oa its
own to make it a State within the meaning of international law.

From the very beginning of the proceedings before the Court, Yugo-
slavia challenged the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is true
that, as the Court noted, Yugoslavia explicitly withdrew this preliminary
objection. However substantial arguments against the statehood of
Bosnia and Herzegovina at the relevant time were indicated by Yugoslavia
in support of its third objection. Exempli causa, Yugoslavia emphasized
that “{t]he central organs of the Government of this Republic controlled
a very small part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina . . . In fact
four states existed in the territory of the former Socialist Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina . . .”’*. The third objection of Yugoslavia may
in substance be reduced to the assertion that Bosnia and Herzegovina, in
the light of relevant legal rules, “has not established its independent state-
hood” within the administrative boundaries of that former federal unit.
This was an additional reason for the Court to take its stand on the
aforementioned question, not only in order to be able to take the decision
on the first preliminary objection of Yugoslavia, but also in order to
decide whether, and to what extent, it was competent in this case.

3. (The concept of the State ab intra.) The concept of the State ab intra
defines the State as an isolated, static phenomenon on the basis of ifs con-
stituent elements. The State so defined is usually understood to be an
entity comprised cumulatively of a permanent population, an established
territory and sovereign authority, Not infrequently, other elements of the
State are also cited but they do not merit the qualification of constituent
elements. They are by their nature either derived elements (exempli causa,
“capacity to enter into relations with other States”) or they reflect exclu-
sivistic concepts which are ontologically in contradiction with the demo-
cratic nature of positive international law (“degree of civilization such as
enables it to observe the principles of international law”, etc.).

As far as the nature of the cited constituent elements of the State are
concerned, they are legal facts. As legal facts they have two dimensions.

The qualification “constituent elements of the State” reflects the static,
phenomenological dimension of the concept of the State. It proceeds
from the State as a fact, Le., phenomenologically, and focuses on the
basic constituent elements of its static being.

In the case of the emergence of new States, the constituent elements of
the concept of the State lose their phenomenological characteristics —
since in that case, there is no State as an entity — and are transformed
into prerequisites for the emergence of a State. In other words, for a cer-

4 LCJ Reports 1972, p. 52.



tain entity to become a State it must cumulatively fulfil conditions which
are, in the material sense, identical with the constituent elements of a
State in the static, phenomenological sense.

words, if one views, within the concept of the State comprised of the
three cited elements, their mutual relationship ab intra.

With the reservation that the value relationship among the cited ele-
ments is to some extent determined in advance by the cumulative nature
of the elements, some conclusions can nonetheless be drawn. First, there
is no doubt that a certain value relationship, if not even a hierarchy, does
exist. Suffice it to note that territory and population are immanent to
some non-State entities as well. It is also beyond doubt that the element
of sovereignty is peculiar to the State alone. Thirdly — and this is the
differentia specifica between States and other, non-State entities — sov-
ereignty is in a sense a qualifying condition, a condition of special value,
for sovereign authority is not only one of the constituent elements of the
State, but it is at the same time an element which gives concrete substance
to the rather abstract and broad concepts of “territory” and “population”
and, in so doing, links them to the concept of the State in the sense of
international law. Evidently, for a “territory” to be “State territory” it
must be subject to sovereign authority. Without it a “territory” is not a
State territory but it is something else (res nullius, trusteeship territory,
res communis omniwm, common heritage of mankind and the like).

Bosnia and Herzegovina at the relevant point in time?

6. There is no doubt that Bosnia and Herzegovina had a “permanent
population” if we use the term in the technical sense, ie, in the sense of
a group of individuals who were linked to the relevant territory by their
way of life.

However, within the system of positive international law, the term
“permanent population” acquires a different meaning. In a system that
recognizes the fundamental significance of the norms of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples (see paras. 67-68, 71 below), the concept of
à “permanent population”, at least when referring to a territory inhabited
by several peoples, cannot have only the cited technical meaning. In that
case, if one is to be able to speak of a “permanent population” in view of
the norm on equal rights and self-determination of peoples, there has to
be a minimum of consensus among the peoples regarding the conditions
of their life together.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina that minimum did not exist. The Referen-
dum of 29 February and 1 March 1992, in relation to the national plebi-



scite of the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina of 9-10 November
1991, showed that the “permanent population” of the federal unit of
Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into the Muslim-Croat peoples on the
one hand and the Serb people on the other. The unification of the com-
munes with a majority Croat population into the Croatian Community
of Herceg-Bosna on 19 November 1991 and especially the formation
of the independent State community of Herceg-Bosna on 4 July 1992,
symbolized the complete divergence of options among the three peoples
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In an entity in which summa potestas is a
constituent element of special importance and bearing in mind how it
was distributed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are strong grounds to
claim that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there were in fact three “perma-
nent populations”.

7. The use of the term “defined territory” implies defined and settled
boundaries in accordance with the rules of positive international law. As
a condition for the existence of a State, “defined and settled boundaries”
do not have absolute value — in practice a State has been considered to
have been constituted even when all its boundaries were not defined.
However, it is essential that “there is a consistent band of territory which
is undeniably controlled by the Government of the alleged State”. The
rule is that the boundaries be established by international treaty or,
exceptionally, on the basis of the principle of effectiveness.

The question whether Bosnia and Herzegovina had “defined and settled
boundaries” has a two-fold meaning: material and in terms of time.

8. In the material sense, the relevant question is whether one can
equate administrative-territorial boundaries within a composite State and
frontiers between States in the sense of international law?

The answer can only be negative bath from the standpoint of the
internal law of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)
and from the standpoint of international law,

As far as the internal law of SFRY is concerned, suffice it to note the
provisions of Article 5 (1) of the SFRY Constitution which stipulated
expressis verbis that the “territory of SFRY is unified” and that it is
“composed of the territories of the Socialist Republics”. That the
“boundaries” between the federal units were merely lines of administra-
tive division is also evidenced by the fact that they were not directly
established by any legal act. They were determined indirectly, via the ter-
ritories of the communes which comprised a certain federal unit so that
they were, in à sense, the aggregation of communal borders. Thus, the
Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulated in Article 5: “[t]he
territory of SR Bosnia-Herzegovina is composed of the areas of the com-
munes”.

5 M. N. Shaw, International Law, 1986, p. 127.




The administrative nature of the boundaries of the federal units in
SFRY was also recognized by the Arbitration Commission of the Con-
ference on Yugoslavia whose opinions are used by the Applicant as its
main argument. In Opinion No. 3, it described the boundaries between
the Yugoslav federal units as “demarcation lines”.

In the light of international law, the terms “frontier” or “State border
lines” are reserved for States with international personality. More par-
ticularly, whereas the SFRY was a State in terms of public international
law and of the United Nations Charter, the republics were the compo-
nent parts of Yugoslavia and, in the context of the legal nature of a fed-
eration, they were the component parts of a single State in foro externo
and of a composite State in foro interno since the federation is distin-
guished by the parallel existence of a federal and a republican govern-

equal rights and self-determination of peoples.

Bosnia and Herzegovina did not accept the “Concept for the future
organization of the State”, proposed by a working group comprising rep-
resentatives of all the Republics, as a basis for further talks involving the
republican presidents and the State Presidency, which, inter alia, included
a “Proposed Procedure for dissociation from Yugoslavia” on the basis of
the self-determination of peoples. This part of the “Concept” which was
drawn up to deal with the constitutional crisis in SFRY in a peaceful and
democratic manner, respecting the relevant norms of international law
and the internal law of SFRY, envisaged a corresponding solution for the
borders as well. On the basis of the draft amendment to the SFRY Con-
stitution, the “Concept” stipulated the obligation of the Federal Govern-
ment to “c. prepare proposals for the territorial demarcation and the
frontiers of the future states and other issues of importance for formu-
lating the enactment on withdrawal”7.

What remains therefore, is the principle of effectiveness as a possible
basis for the transformation of the administrative-territorial boundaries
of the federal unit of Bosnia and Herzegovina into international borders.
As this principle implies the effective, actual exercise of sovereign author-
ity, and considering the scope of that authority of the central government
in Sarajevo (see para. 18 below), it is beyond doubt that the mentioned
transformation of boundaries on the basis of the principle of effective-
ness did not occur.

10. The Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia
whose opinion Bosnia and Herzegovina uses as argument, states with
respect to the relevant question:

“lelxcept where otherwise agreed, the former boundaries become
borders protected by international law. This conclusion follows from
the principle of respect for the territorial status quo and, in particu-
lar, from the principle of uti possidetis . . . [which] though mitially
applied in settling decolonization issues in America and Africa, is
today recognized as a general principle, as stated by the Interna-
tional Court of Justice in its Judgment of 22 December 1986 in the
case between Burkina Faso and Mali (Frontier Dispute, (1986) LC.J
Reports 554 at 565):

‘Nevertheless the principle is not a special rule which pertains

? Foeus, Special Issue, January 1992, p. 33.




solely to one specific system of international law. It is a general
principle, which is logically connected with the phenomenon of
the obtaining of independence, wherever it occurs, Its obvious
purpose is to prevent the independence and stability of the new
States being endangered by fratricidal struggles.’ ”#

12. Tt was the Dayton Agreement which transformed the administra-

tive

Boundaries of Bosnia and Herzegovina into international borders,

Article 10 of the Agreement stipulates that “[t]he Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognize each
other as sovereign independent States within their international borders”.

13, Regardless of theoretical definitions of sovereignty and the distine-
tions based on them regarding its manifestations, it is evident that the
sovereignty of States implies:

()

(ii)

suprema potestas — “by which is meant that the State has over it no
other authority than that of international law” 0, The equals-mark
that is being placed between suprema potestas and independence! is
indicative of a substantial fact — that the entity purporting to be a
State in the sense of international public law takes vital political deci-
sions autonomously and independently of third States. A State in the
international legal sense cannot and must not comply with alien
political decisions regardless of whether such compliance has a
formal or informal basis. Therein lies the meaning of the qualifica-
tion according to which “the first condition for statehoed is that
there must exist a government actually independent of any other
State” !2,

summa potestas — in the sense of the exercise of real, factual author-
ity on the territory of the State, The intention to establish genuine
authority is no more than a political project, an intellectual construc-
tion that has not materialized. That intention has to be realized and
this implies, inter alia, the existence of an institutional network suit-

able for and capable of implementing its decisions throughout the
State territory. Hence, summa potestas is a mere figure of speech
“until a stable political organisation has been created, and until pub-
lic authorities become strong enough to assert themselves throughout
the territory of the State™!3,

These two segments of sovereignty constitute an organic whole, As for
their mutual relationship, sumuna potestas has the character of a prior

istrative boundaries of the former Yugoslav federal unit.

Such an approach is somewhat surprising, since “the State exists by
itself (par lui-même} and the recognition of a State is nothing else than a
declaration of this existence, recognized by the States from which it ema-
nates” 3,

This is specially so, having in mind that “the practice of States shows
that the act of recognition is still regarded as essentially a political deci-
sion, which each State decides in accordance with its own free apprecia-
tion of the situation”,

It is reasonable to suppose that, merely by relying on these facts, the
learned scholar is able to conclude that “[rlecognition is still in the lan-
guage of diplomats but it does not belong in the language of law” 33.

It is true that the position of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a specific one,
since it has been recognized by practically the whole international com-
munity, This fact serves as the basis for the thesis that

“recognition, along with membership of international organizations,
bears witness to these States’ conviction that the political entity so
recognized is a reality and confers on it certain rights and obliga-
tions under international law”.

This, in doctrinal terms, elegant thesis highlights among other things,
the ambivalent nature of the institute of recognition of States. Tn the
spirit of the ruling, declarative theory, the recognition of States should be
a statement of the factual situation formed /eges artis in harmony with
the relevant legal rules on the emergence of new States. The “States” con-
viction that the political entity . . . is a reality” clearly need not corre-
spond to the factual situation. “Conviction”, per definitionem, is not a

factual condition but its subjective expression — hence it is necessary ad
casum to carry out an investigation so as to establish the precise meaning
of the phrase “States’ conviction” and to see whether or not it is based on
fact or law. 4 contrario, the whole problem would be shifted to the
domain of the rule of “majority opinion”, so that fact would be what the
majority considers it to be,

Having that in mind, it is, generally speaking, necessary from the
standpoint of law to examine in each individual case whether the relevant
legal criteria for recognition are met.

Concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is obvious that, as an assumed
State in the administrative boundaries of that former Yugoslav federal
unit, it could be ranked among the circle of States only as a new State.
Hence, it is necessary to see which criteria are relevant for the recognition

fying, as an imperative norm of international law, the principles
appearing in the preamble to the Charter”,

Jus cogens creates grounds for a global change in relations of State
sovereignty to the legal order in the international community and for the
establishment of conditions in which the rule of law can prevail over the
free will of States, As an objective, non-eliminatory norm, it constitutes a
material basis, a criterion for challenging the legality of individual acts in
the international community. Therefore, it essentially limits the impact of
effectiveness in international law. Effectiveness in a system with a defined
concept of legality may be legally accepted only in cases in which it does
not conflict with the norms that serve as criteria of legality. Within the
co-ordinates of the de jure order effectiveness versus legality is an incor-
rect approach, because to accept effectiveness as a rule

“would indeed be to apply a hatchet to the very roots of the law of
nations and to cover with its spurious authority an infinitive series of
international wrongs and disregard for international obligations”?!

44. The concept of a material, homogeneous legality is unavoidably
reflected in the matter of the birth of States. This is suggested by an as yet
insufficiently advanced and stabilized international practice. Let us take
the case of Southern Rhodesia. In that case, the criterion of effectiveness
was fully met, as the white, minority government, exercised effective rule
over the territory. But, in spite of that, United Nations Security Council
resolution 217 of 20 November 1965 established that the declaration of
independence had “no legal validity” and national government had been
proclaimed by “illegal authorities”. Such an attitude towards Southern
Rhodesia, which on the basis of the ab intra criterion, was a State beyond
any doubt, was governed by the intention “to allow the people of South-
ern Rhodesia to determine their own future consistent with the objectives
of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) (1960)2. United Nations
General Assembly resolution 1514 of 14 December 1960, entitled “Dec-
laration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples” established, inter alia, that

“All peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of
that right they freely determine their political status and freely
pursue their economic, social and cultural development.” (Para. 2.) -

In that way the practice of States confirmed that:

“in the case of an entity seeking to become a state and accepted by
the international community as being entitled to exercise the right of
self-determination, it may well be necessary to demonstrate that the
internal requirements of the principle have not been offended. One
cannot define this condition too rigorously in view of state practice
to date, but it would appear to be a sound proposition that system-
atic and institutionalised discrimination might invalidate a claim to
statehood.”

However, it would be an overstatement to assert that the introduction of
the concept of material legality created a harmonious unity between the
ab intra and ab extra definitions of a State. This has not been achieved
due to the chronic institutional insufficiency of the international order
which, acting in the environment of a primarily political community —
which is what the international community virtually is — often leads to
the prevalence of policy over law. Hence, the discrepancy between inter-
national law and international order, since norms have not always been
applied as they should have been in view of their substance, but more or
less under the influence of non-legal, political views. Indisputably, the
achievement of the aforementioned harmony constitutes not only an aim
of but also a condition for the establishment of international order as a
de jure order in this particular context.

B. The Legality of the Proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's
Independence in the Light of the Internal Law of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia

I. Relevance of the internal law of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in this particular case

45. The original international legal norm of self-determination of
peoples is both incomplete and imperfect, at least when it concerns sub-
jects entitled to self-determination in multi-ethnic States and their exer-
cise of external self-determination infringing upon the territorial integrity
of a State. Given its incompleteness, the original norm of self-determina-
tion of peoples is rendered inapplicable in its respective parts to certain
practical situations and constitutes a sort of decorative, empty normative
structure. Interested entities often refer to it, but it can function only out-
side the legal domain, as a convenient cover for an eminently political
strategy, based on opportuneness and the balance of power.

This implies a need to see the norm of the right to external self-deter-
mination in the States composed of more than one people as a complex
norm consisting of two parts: on the one hand, original international
legal norms of the right of peoples to external self-determination, and, on
the other, relevant parts of the internal law of the given State. In this con-
text, the original international legal norm of the right of peoples has the
role of a general, permissive norm, which assumes an operative character,
the property of a norm which may become effective in the event that the
internal law of a multi-ethnic State has stipulated the right to external
self-determination if it defines the entitlement to it, as well as the pro-
cedure for its exercise. In other words, the relevant provisions of internal
law are ad casum an integral part of the norm of the right of peoples to
external self-determination. Only in this way does the original interna-
tional legal norm of the right to external self-determination become
applicable at the level of the fundamental premise of the rule of law,

The necessity for such a relationship between international and inter-
nal laws is rightfully suggested by the following:

“If the rule of law is to be made effective in world affairs it must
cover a wide range of increasingly complex transactions which are
governed partly by international and partly by municipal law . . . It
is therefore important that international courts and tribunals should
be in a position, when adjudicating upon complex international
transactions, to apply simultancously the relevant principles and
rules of international law and the provisions of any system of
municipal law which may be applicable to the particular transaction
.. . One of the essential functions of international law and interna-
tional organisation is to promote the rule of law within as well as
among nations, for only on the basis of the rule of law within
nations can the rule of law among nations develop and be made




secure. International courts and tribunals can contribute to this
result more effectively if the extent to which the interpretation and
application of municipal law in the course of their work is a normal
and necessary incident of international adjudication on complex
transactions is more fully understood.”

Positive international law free of Manicheanism and the antagonistic
burden of dualistic-monistic theoretical controversy has firmly embarked
upon this course. One can think of a long list of rules of positive inter-
national law that rest on the symbiosis of an international norm contain-
ing both implicit and explicit references to the internal law and the
respective norms of that internal law. To illustrate, Article 46 of the Con-
vention on the Law of Treaties (1969) stipulates that a State may invoke
the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in
violation of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as
invalidating its consent in a case where that “violation was manifest and
concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance”. Or in
the law of the sea, where the subject of protection and preservation of the
marine environment is entirely regulated on the basis of a symbiosis of
international and internal laws. Exempli causa, Article 207 (1) (Pollution
from Land-Based Sources) of the Convention on the Law of the Sea
stipulates:

“States shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and

peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina — Muslims, Serbs and Croats, and
a corresponding number of deputies members of other people and
nationalities and the others who live in Bosnia and Herzegovina”,

who are to take decisions “on the merit of agreement of members from
among the ranks of all peoples and nationalities”.




The ratio legis of Amendment LXX (10) certainly lies in ensuring and
guaranteeing the equality of peoples. The significance attached to the
Council, within the constitutional system of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is
amply demonstrated in paragraph 10, which says that

“in questions of interest to the exercise of equality of peoples and
nationalities in B-H, at the proposal of the Council, the Assembly
shall decide, by means of a specific procedure set out in the Rules of
Order of the Assembly of the Socialist Republic Bosnia and Herze-
govina, by a two-thirds majority of the total number of deputes”.

The Council was designed by the Constitution as an unavoidable instance,
a forum where deliberations were concentrated and proposals originated
for the equality of peoples. In view of these facts, the proposal to call a
referendum on the “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina” must have been
an issue for consideration by the Council, as this is the question that
directly infringed upon “the principles of equality among peoples and
nationalities”.

The circle of formal and material unconstitutionality encompasses also
the act of “official promulgation of the results of the referendum
on March 6, 1992”, The qualification of “official promulgation” invokes,
mutatis mutandis, the relevance of the facts corroborating the formal and
material unconstitutionality of calling the referendum on the status of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The referendum on the “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina” falls into
the category of the so-called preliminary referenda in the constitutional
regulation of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, since the
purpose had been a preliminary voting of citizens on the relevant issue of
the status of Bosnia and Herzegovina, That is why the “official promul-
gation of the results of a referendum” is, actually, a legal act. More par-
ticularly, voting of citizens in a referendum is no decision in formal
terms, irrespective of whether the result of the voting is or is not binding
on the organ which called the referendum. The result of the referendum is
a material condition for decision-making in formal terms and this is, in
the present case, the nature of the “official promulgation™.

Such a legal nature of the “official promulgation” of a federal unit of
Bosnia and Herzegovina as a “sovereign and independent” State consti-
tutes an additional aspect of material unconstitutionality in respect to the
relevant decisions of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. More particularly, Article 252 of that Constitution
stipulated that the:

“Isjacred and inalienable right and responsibility of peoples and
nationalities . . . of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to safeguard and
foster freedom, independence, sovereignty, ferritorial unity and the
constitutionally established social system of the SFRY and the Social-
ist Republic Bosnia and Herzegovina” (emphasis added).




Item 7 of Amendment LXIX to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina provided that: “Political organizations and
acts aimed at the forceful change of the constitutionally established system,
and threats to the territorial unity and independence of SFRY” (emphasis
added) are prohibited. Both of the constitutional provisions mentioned
above include “territorial unity” as a constitutionally protected object
while “official promulgation” is a form of direct threat to that object.

66. The referendum for determination of the status of Bosnia and
Herzegovina was called in the form of a referendum of citizens. This fact
derives from the method of voting at the referendum, which remained un-
disputed by Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it stated in its Memorial, in the
context of the promulgation of its sovereignty and independence (Memo-
rial, para. 4.2.1.10), inter afia, that “the majority of the people of the
Republic” voted positively on the referendum question. The use of the
term “people” in the singular undoubtedly suggests that Bosnia and
Herzegovina is also of the view that this was but a civic referendum,

Was a civic referendum, in the form of a direct expression of the will of
citizens, quite apart from the questions elaborated in items 5 and 6, a
good way in which to decide the “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina”?
Civic referendum is, per definitionem, a form of the exercise of national
sovereignty, that is to say, the rule of the people as Demos, Since three
peoples exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina and are provided with the right
to self-determination, it is indisputable, irrespective of the reasons stated
in paragraphs 5 and 27 of this opinion, that the form of civic referendum
is absolutely inadequate to express the will of each of the three peoples.
In some sort of ultimately strained hypothesis that “sovereign and inde-
pendent Bosnia” was voted for by such a majority of citizens embodying
the majority of each of the members of the three peoples, it might be said
that a civic referendum consummated the national referendum, although
per se it was not such a referendum. But that was not the case, as is
known. In view of the fact that all the three peoples of Bosnia and Herze-
govina are, by virtue of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
“sovereign and equal”, a national referendum is only relevant for the
direct exercise of the right to self-determination. A separate exercise of
the right to self-determination could have been anticipated by means of a
corresponding decision taken by elected representatives of the three
peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly as in 1990, democratic
multiparty elections were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Maps of con-
stituencies correctly mirrored the ethnic structure of Bosnia and Herze-
govina since the national parties of the three peoples individually
gathered practically all the votes of their national corps.

The referendum was an inadequate form of voting on the “status of
Bosnia and Herzegovina” not only because of the reasons relating to its
constitutionality and essential inability to express the will of the three
peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but because of the very provisions of
the Law on Referendum on the basis of which it was held.




The provisions of the Law on Referendum of Bosnia and Herzegovina
taken per se are certainly not formulated so as to imply the possibility
of deciding “on the status of Bosnia and Herzegovina” by means of a
referendum, as designed by the Law.

Apart from the general provisions on calling the referendum already
discussed in paragraph 5 of this opinion, the provisions concerning the
method of decision-making and the individuals participating in the
voting are also of relevance.

Article 33 of the Law stipulates that the

“decision on referendum is to be taken by a majority vote of all
working people and citizens registered as voters in the territory
or part of the territory of SR of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the
referendum is called”.

The decision at the referendum is to be taken by majority vote. Leav-
ing aside the issue of the legality of a referendum, a logical question
arises, i.e., whether a valid issue, such as “the status of Bosnia and Herze-
govina”, may possibly be decided by simple majority. The rational reason
underlying this question relates to the fact that the Constitution of the
Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulated voting of at
least two-thirds of the total number of voters of the Socialist Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina on the question of a change of borders of the
Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Amendment LXIT to Ar-
ticle 5 of the Constitution '*®). In other words, the constitutional require-
ment for the correction of indirectly determined lines of administrative
division within the federation was a two-thirds majority, while the Law on
Referendum required a simple majority for the decision on the status of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of public law. This is, in my view, suffi-
cient proof that the legislator did not, when passing the Law on Referen-
dum (either irrespective of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina or just relying on the Constitution of the Socialist
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina), have in mind a referendum of that
kind. More particularly, it 1s difficult to imagine that the legislator would
lay down much stricter requirements for a referendum on the change of
borders, which in the practice of the Yugoslav federal units was nothing
but a couple of hectares of pasture lands, forests or villages, than
for a referendum on the fateful, existential question of the very federal
unit.

The Law on Referendum also stipulated that “all working people and
citizens included in voters’ lists in the territory, namely that part of ter-
ritory of SR B-H where referendum shall take place”, shall have the right
to vote in the referendum (Art. 33 of the Law). Such a provision raises
the question about who in fact was voting at the referendum. The provi-
sion entitling “all working people and citizens” to vote means that the
criterion of eligibility to vote was not citizenship in the republic. The only

189 Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, No. 21.(1990).



criterion was residence, since it was a condition of enlistment for voting.
Hence, the right to vote in the referendum was, for instance, accorded to
Slovenes or Macedonians, who had a residence in Bosnia and Herze-
govina, while Muslims or Serbs, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who
resided in another republic were deprived of that right.

67. Finally, from the standpoint of the Constitutional law of SFRY, it
would be hard to imagine a more meritorious judgment on the legal
evaluation of the referendum on the “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina”
than the one handed down by the Constitutional Court of Yugoslavia as
the main proponent of constitutionality and legality in the constitutional
system of SFRY (Art. 375 of the SFRY Constitution). The Constitu-
tional Court of Yugoslavia never took up the referendum on the status of
Bosnia and Herzegovina as à separate issue. However, it made several
rulings on the analogous acts of federal units which had promulgated
“sovereignty and independence” before Bosnia and Herzegovina. Apart
from the actual decisions of the Constitutional Court of Yugoslavia in
the concrete cases, we shall quote from relevant parts of the explanations
of those decisions since they extend beyond the framework of the con-
Crete issue in formal and material terms, on which the court ruled. In
other words they constitute a meritorious legal evaluation of the highest
judicial instance in SFRY on the relevant question. In ruling IU
No. 108/1-91 (Official Gazette of SFRY, No. 83/91), the Constitutional
Court pointed out, inter alia, that

“The right of peoples of Yugoslavia to self-determination, includ-
ing the right to secession, may not, in the view of the Constitutional
Court of Yugoslavia, be exercised by unilateral acts of the peoples of
Yugoslavia, namely enactments of the Assemblies of the republics
within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . . . Although
the procedure for the exercise of the right to self-determination
including the right to secession is not provided for by the SFRY
Constitution, this does not mean that the right can be exercised on
the basis of unilateral acts on self-determination and secession. No
people and, more particularly, no assembly of a republic can, by
means of a umlateral act, decide on the exercise of that right before
the procedure and conditions governing the procedure have been
jointly determined for the exercise of that right.

A unilateral promulgation of sovereignty and independence of
republics making up the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
implies, in the opinion of the Constitutional Court of Yugoslavia, an .
infringement upon the provisions of the SFRY Constitution con-
cerning the composition of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo-
slavia and of the frontiers of Yugoslavia as a federal state and state
community of voluntarily united peoples and their socialist repub-
lies”



It is worth mentioning that the above ruling was approved in the course
of the court deliberations in full composition as provided for in
Article 381 of the SFRY Constitution and in the presence of both judges
from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Herzegovina in the Light of International Law

Nations Charter and continuing via the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (1960), and the Cov-
enants on Human Rights (1966), to the Declaration on Principles of
International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation
among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations
(1974), the equal rights and self-determination of peoples has been of
essential universal value of the democratic ordre public embodied in the
United Nations Charter, and raised to a positive norm of general inter-
national law with the character of jus cogens!!9, In the case concerning
East Timor, the Court in its Judgment stated inter alia:

“In the Court’s view, . . . the right of peoples to self-determina-
tion, as it is evolved from the Charter and from United Nations

69. Equal rights and self-determination of peoples is a complex norm
in terms of structure,

On the one hand, the very phrase “equal rights and self-determination
of peoples” is a link, an amalgam of a general legal principle (“equal
rights”) and the norm on the self-determination of peoples. “Equal
rights” in the above phrase, as a normative substitute for “equality of
States”, has a broader meaning because it defines, in a broader form, the
relationship of each people taken individually to the sum of rights recog-
nized to peoples under international law. Its virtual meaning lies in a
prohibition of any distinction between peoples and the respective rights
recognized to them. In other words, the principle of “equal rights”
defines the scope of the norms of international law that relate to the
status of peoples. The right to self-determination does, however, have an
immediate material substance as

“all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external

83. Bosnia and Herzegovina claims that it is a “successor State”
because:

(a) “succession of States” means the “replacement of one State by
another in the responsibility for the international relations of terri-
tory”, according to the very widely accepted definition given in both
Vienna Conventions on Succession of States of 1978 and 1983; and

(b) “it is obvious that Bosnia and Herzegovina has replaced the former
SFRY for the international relations of what was the Federal
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina before the dissolution of
former Yugoslavia” (Memorial, para. 4.2.1.26).

On the contrary, the position of Yugoslavia in the subject-matter is
that “the so-called Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has not become
a State party to that 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide in accordance with the provisions of the Con-
vention itself” (Submissions, B.1) because:

(a) “The Applicant State cannot enter into the international treaties of
the predecessor State on the basis of succession because it flagrantly
violated the principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples” (Preliminary Objections, para. B.1.2.39);

(b) “As the Applicant State has violated the obligations deriving from
the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, the
Vienna Convention on the Succession of States in Respect of
Treaties could not apply to this case even if it had come into
force” (ibid., para. B.1.3.5); and

(c) “Notification of succession is a manner of entry into treaties of the
predecessor State in cases where the new State has based its exist-
ence upon the principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples. In this particular case, the Applicant State has based its
existence on the violation of duties deriving from the principle of
equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and thus cannot
make use of the notification of succession as a method of entry
into the international treaties of its predecessor State.” (Jbid.,
para. B.1.4.11.)

The essence of this objection by Yugoslavia is that because of its




“flagrant violation of the principle of equal rights and self-determination
of peoples”, Bosnia and Herzegovina was not a successor State and
hence could not have acquired the capacity of State party to the 1948
Convention on Genocide on the grounds of succession.

To make a valid conclusion on the merits of the objection, it is
necessary to answer the question of whether there is a connection between
succession of States and legality of territorial changes.

84. The answer to this question implies a precise definition of the con-
cept of succession. The term “succession” is used in a broad, imprecise
meaning.

“Succession of States means both the territorial change itself — in
other words, the fact that within a given territory one State replaces
another — and the succession of one of those States to the rights and
obligations of the other, i.e., the State whose territory has passed to
the successor States.” !23

It can be seen that the term “succession” means two things: (a) territo-
rial change itself; and (6) transmission of rights and obligations from
predecessor State to successor State(s).

The distinction between succession taken in terms of territorial change
(de facto succession) and succession as transmission of derived rights and
obligations from predecessor State to successor State(s) (de jure succes-
sion) is drawn also by the Convention on Succession of States in respect
of Treaties, referred to by Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to prove its
status of “Successor State”. This Convention in its Article 2 (b) (Use of
Terms) defines “succession of States” as “the replacement of one State by
another in the responsibility for the international relations of the terri-
tory”. At the same time, Article 6 (Cases of Succession of States Covered
by the Present Convention) specifies that the Convention “applies only to
the effects of a succession of States occurring in conformity with the
international law and, in particular, the principles of international law
embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”. Relations between
Article 2 (b) and Article 6 of the Convention are precisely defined in
the Comment to Article 2 of the Draft Articles on Succession of States in
respect of Treaties on the basis of which Article 2 of the Convention on
Succession of States in respect of Treaties was adopted. This Comment,
inter alia, says:

“the term [‘succession’] is used as referring exclusively to the fact of
replacement of one State by another in the responsibility for inter-

national Law, 1947, Vol. 24, pp. 360-361.




national relations of territory leaving aside any connotation of inheri-
tance of rights or obligations on the occurrence of that event™ !%4,

Such a definition of succession corresponds to the basic concept of
“succession of States” which emerged from the study of the topic by the
International Law Commission. More particularly:

“The approach to succession adopted by the Commission after its
study of the topic of succession in respect of treaties is based upon
drawing a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the fact of
replacement of one State by another in the responsibility for the
international relations of a territory and, on the other, the transmis-
sion of treaty rights and obligations from the predecessor to the suc-
cessor State . . .

In order to make clear the distinction between the fact of replace-
ment of one State by another and the transmission of rights and obli-
gations, the Commission inserted in article 2 a provision defining
the meaning of the expression ‘succession of States’ for the purpose
of the draft. Under this provision the expression ‘succession of
States’ is used throughout the articles to denote simply a change in
the responsibility for the international relations of a territory, thus
leaving aside from the definition all questions of the rights and obli-
gations as a legal incident of that change.” !?5

This distinction was necessary as

“the difficulty stemmed from the fact that the expression ‘succession’
was not qualified in the definitions of it given in art. 2 (1, b). From
that paragraph it might be deduced that the convention was also
intended to apply to unlawful successions” '26,

Because of that,

“art. 6 was the most important saving clause of the draft articles,
since it safeguarded the legality of all provisions of the future con-
ventions by limiting their application to the effects of lawful succes-
sion . . . the provisions of the future convention would not apply to

unlawful transfers which were contrary to the will of people and to
the principle of self-determination” !?7,

Therefore, “succession of States” in terms of “replacement of one State
by another in the responsibility for the international relations of terri-
tory” “does not mean ipso facto a juridical substitution of the acquiring
State in the complex rights and duties possessed by the previous sover-
eign”!?5 or, in the present case, entry into the international treaties of
SFRY as a predecessor State. The condition thereto is that the “replace-
ment of one State by another” occurred “in conformity with interna-
tional law, in particular, with the principles of international law em-
bodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.

85. À provision concerning territorial changes to be effected “in con-
formity with international law and, in particular, with the principles of
international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations” has a
declarative impact. So,

“even if the article did not appear in the convention, that instrument
would apply only to lawful succession from the point of view of the
principles of international law especially those embodied in the UN
Charter, which was the keystone of all international conventions” !?°,

The principle underlying the provision of Article 6 of the Convention on
Succession of States in respect of Treaties is a self-evident principle, axio-
matic to any legal order stricto sensu. It is ratione materiae a narrowed
projection of the general concept of lawfulness of acts, an application of
the concept of lawfulness to the questions of succession. In view of the
material significance of lawfulness for the very existence of a de jure
order, the rule making provisions of any codification applicable only to
the facts occurring and situations established in conformity with interna-
tional law is a general presumption, a self-explanatory matter! The
reason for a universal provision of legality led the Commission separately
to specify the rule limiting the application of the provisions of the Con-
vention to the cases of lawful succession:

“Other members, however, were of the opinion that in regard,
particularly, to transfers of territory it was desirable to underline

130 “to admit that, apart from well-defined exceptions, an unlawful act, or its immediate
consequences, may become suo vigore a source of legal right for the wrongdoer, is to
introduce into a legal system a contradiction which cannot be solved except by
denial of its legal character. International law does not and cannot form an excep-
tion to that imperative alternative.” (H. Lauterpacht, Recognition in International
Law, 1947, p. 421.)




that only transfers occurring in conformity with international law
should fall within the concept of ‘succession of States’ for the pur-
pose of the present articles. Since, to specify the element of conform-
ity with the international law with reference to one category of suc-
cession of States might give rise to misunderstandings as to the
position regarding that element on other categories of succession of
States, the Commission decided to include amongst the general
articles a provision safeguarding the question of lawfulness of the
succession of States dealt with in the present articles. Accordingly,
article 6 provides that the present articles relate only to the effects
of a succession of States occurring in conformity with international
law.” 13!

86. Notification of succession is only a technical means by which the
successor State expresses its consent to be considered bound by the treaty
whose original party is the predecessor State. Hence, to make a notifica-
tion of succession produce its intended legal effects, the actual succession
must have been lawful. The criterion of lawfulness of the succession is
“international law and, in particular, the principles of international law
embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.

In the present case, and with regard to the position of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, of special importance are the principles of territorial integ-
rity and political unity, and of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples.

The specific relevance of those principles for the matter of succession is
a logical consequence of the nature of changes activating the institution
of succession and the role of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples in constituting new States. Hence, these principles of the United
Nations Charter have been particularly accentuated. The Special Rap-
porteur, Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, stated in his proposal concerning
lawfulness of succession that,

“The conditions for succession of States shall include respect for
general international law and the provisions of the United Nations
Charter concerning the territorial integrity of States and the right of
peoples to self-determination.” 32

The Preamble to the Convention on Succession of States in respect of
Treaties “recall[s] that respect for the territorial integrity and political
independence of any State is required by the Charter of the United

131 UNCSS, First Session, p. 236, para. |.

Nations”. That wording confirms that the existence of territorial integrity
and political independence derive from the United Nations Charter and,
hence, binds the States irrespective of the Convention.

87. The proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a “sovereign and
independent state” constitutes, in my view, a substantial breach of the
cogent norm on equal rights and self-determination of peoples in both
the formal and material sense.

A substantial breach in the formal sense is reflected in the following:

(a) the procedure of proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was con-
ducted in an unconstitutional way, contrary to the relevant provi-
sions of its own Constitution and that of the SFRY ;

(b) self-determination in the subject case was de facto conceived as a
right of a territory within a sovereign, independent State, rather
than as a right of peoples.

The breach of the norm on equal rights and self-determination of
peoples in a material sense is reflected in the following:

(a) the proclamation of independence of a federal unit of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in violation of relevant provisions of the internal law
of the SFRY and of Bosnia and Herzegovina, endangered the terri-
torial integrity and political unity of SFRY, in contravention of the
provision of paragraph 7 of the Declaration on Principles;

(b) the proclamation of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina
within its administrative borders was not based on the equal rights
and self-determination of all three peoples of Bosnia and Herze-
govina.

Therefore, the proclamation of the independence of Bosnia and Herze-
govina was not in conformity with the relevant principles of equal rights
and self-determination of peoples, and territorial integrity and political
unity and, as such, has no merit for lawful succession in terms of the suc-
cession of Bosnia and Herzegovina with respect to the Convention on
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

88. By its nature, the proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s inde-
pendence was an act of secession. Bosnia and Herzegovina does not con-
test that assertion of Yugoslavia. It is taken from paragraph 3.22 of the
Statement of Bosnia and Herzegovina which reads:

“whether or not Bosnia, at the time of its secession, had a right to
self-determination is irrelevant because: (1) it is now a recognized,
sovereign State, and (2) even if, arguendo, it were supposed that it
had no right to self-determination in international law, international
law certainly did not prohibit its achieving the status of an indepen-
dent State at the occasion of the disintegration of the Former



Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.” (Statement of the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Prelimi-
nary Objections, p. 60.)

89. Secession is, per definitionem, “the creation of a State by the use or
threat of force and without the consent of the former sovereign”!*.
Therefore it is understandable that the

“United Nations Charter does not recognize the term or concept of
‘secession’, for this concept is profoundly at odds with the spirit and
normative principles of the Charter. The Charter raises respect for
territorial integrity to the rank of a constitutional norm, a norm of
jus cogens. On January 1, 1970, the UN Secretary-General made the
following statement:

‘So, as far as the question of secession of a particular section of a
Member State is concerned, the United Nations’ attitude is un-
equivocal. As an international organization, the United Nations has
never accepted and does not accept, and I do not believe it will ever
accept, the principle of secession of a part of a Member State.””!34

The Security Council has characterized secession as illegal. In its resolu-
tion 169 (1961) on the Congo, the Security Council, inter alia,

“strongly deprecate{d] the secessionist activities illegally carried out
by the provincial administration of Katanga with the aid of external
resources and manned by foreign mercenaries . . . and

Declarefd],
(d) that all secessionist activities against the Republic of Congo are
contrary to the Loi fondamentale”.
The implicit characterization of secession as an illegal act under inter-
national law can be found in paragraph 7 of the “Declaration of Prin-
ciples of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations among

States” which stipulates, inter alia, that the right to self-determination
shall not be construed as

“authorizing or encouraging any action which could dismember or
impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of
sovereign and independent States”.

On the regional, European level, such a characterization of secession is
contained in the Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between

133 J. Crawford, The Creation of States in International Law, 1979, p. 247.
134 United Nations, Monthly Chronicle, Vol. 7, p. 36 (February 1970).




Participating States contained in the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe (CSCE) Final Act adopted on 1 August 1975 at
Helsinki:

“[t]he participating States regard as inviolable all one another’s fron-
tiers as well as the frontiers of all States in Europe and therefore they
will refrain now and in future from assaulting these frontiers”.

On the other hand, an explicit condemnation of secession can be found in
the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations as a formal
source of international law pursuant to Article 38 (c} of the Statute
of the International Court of Justice. Secession is deemed to be a most
serious crime by the national legislations of civilized nations. More par-
ticularly, an inside assault on the territorial integrity of a country
or an attempted assault, including preparatory actions, are categorized
as one of the gravest of crimes in virtually all the criminal codes of
civilized nations.

90. The admission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations
cannot convalidate substantial legal defects in its establishment as an
independent State, especially because of the need to draw a sharp distine-
tion between

“secession in pursuance of, and in violation of, self-determination.
Where the territory in question is a self-determination unit it may be
presumed that any secessionary government possesses the general
support of the people: secession in such a case, where self-determi-
nation is forcibly denied, will be presumed to be in furtherance of, or
at least not inconsistent with, the application of self-determination
to the territory in question.” !3’

There is not much doubt that the admission of Bosnia and Herze-
govina to the United Nations has given general, political support to Bos-
nia and Herzegovina. However that political support does not, and coutd
not, be interpreted as a subsequent convalidation of illegality of Bosnia
and Herzegovina’s birth. Even if the General Assembly had such an
intention in mind when admitting Bosnia and Herzegovina to the mem-
bership of the United Nations, such an outcome was legally impossible,
since such an act implied a derogation from the self-determination of
peoples which has the character of jus cogens. Norms of jus cogens do
not tolerate derogation, so any concurrent régime or situation, whether it
be established by way of à bilateral or unilateral act, cannot acquire legal
force due to the peremptoriness of jus cogens — more specifically, this act
or acts remains in the sphere of simple facts. One could say that this is a
classic example of application of the general principle of law expressed in

135 J. Crawford, op. cit, p. 258; see also, separate opinion of Judge Ammoun, Western
Sahara, 1.C.J. Reports 1975, pp. 99-100.




the maxim quidquid ab initio vitiosus est, non polest tractu temporis
convalescere.


99. Three principal legal questions are raised by Yugoslavia’s fifth
preliminary objection, and relate to:

(a) the qualification of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina;

(b) the territorial or non-territorial nature of the obligations of States
under the Genocide Convention; and

(c) the type of the State responsibility referred to in Article IX of the
Convention.

100. Having in mind the territorial nature of the obligations of States
under the Genocide Convention, the qualification of the conflict in Bos-
nia and Herzegovina is of considerable importance. Even if this question
1s closely linked to the merits, this does not prevent the Court from

“mak[ing] a summary survey of the merits to the extent necessary to
satisfy itself that the case discloses claims that are reasonably argu-
able or issues that are reasonably contestable; in other words, that
these claims or issues are rationally grounded on one or more prin-
ciples of law, the application of which may resolve the dispute. The
essence of this preliminary survey of the merits is that the question
of jurisdiction or admissibility under consideration is to be deter-
mined not on the basis of whether the applicant’s claim is right but
exclusively on the basis whether it discloses a right to have the claim
adjudicated.” '?

In my opinion, the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be quali-
fied as “civil war” or “internal conflict” exclusively as Yugoslavia asserts.
That assertion is only partly correct.

The armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a special, sui
generis conflict, in which elements of civil war and international armed
conflict were intermingled.

Elements of civil war were obviously present in the armed conflict in
Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, according to my opinion, they could
in no way be seen as its dominant characteristic. They were especially

expressed in the period of constitutional crisis before the proclamation of
the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the incomplete parlia-
ment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The passive, preparatory stage of that
war consisted especially of the acts of creation of national militias as
early as in 1991, while the active phase of the war started with attacks
against the organs of the central federal authorities, especially against the
units of the Yugoslav People’s Army.

After the proclamation of sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and
Herzegovina by the incomplete parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
the civil war became, in my opinion, an international armed conflict, in
which one side consisted of a fictitious, de jure recognized State — the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina — and the other side consisted of
two de facto States not recognized by the international community —
Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosna. This was bellum omnium contra
omnes, which is eloquently shown by the war between the Muslim authori-
ties in Sarajevo and Herzeg-Bosna in 1993, and by the war between the
authorities in Sarajevo and the alternative Muslim Autonomous Region
of Western Bosnia, proclaimed in September 1993.

101. The relevant passage of the Court’s Judgment relating to the
nature of the rights and obligations of States under the Convention reads
as follows:

“the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are rights and
obligations erga omnes. The Court notes that the obligation each State
thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not territo-
rially limited by the Convention.” (Para. 31 of the Judgment.)

In my opinion, it is necessary to draw a clear distinction, on the one
hand, between the legal nature of the norm prohibiting genocide, and, on
the other, the implementation or enforcement of that norm.

The norm prohibiting genocide, as a norm of jus cogens, establishes
obligations of a State toward the international community as a whole,
hence by its very nature it is the concern of all States. As a norm of jus
cogens it does not have, nor could it possibly have, a limited territorial
application with the effect of excluding its application in any part of the
international community. In other words, the norm prohibiting genocide
as a universal norm binds States in all parts of the world.

As an absolutely binding norm prohibiting genocide, it binds all sub-
jects of international law even without any conventional obligation. To
that effect, and only to that effect, the concrete norm is of universal
applicability (a norm erga omnes), and hence “non-territorality” as
another pole of limited territorial application may be taken as an element
of the very being of a cogent norm of genocide prohibition.

The position is different, however, when it comes to the implementa-
tion or enforcement of the norm of genocide prohibition. The norm pro-
hibiting genocide, like other international legal norms, is applicable by




States not in an imaginary space, but in an area of the territoralized inter-
national community. And, as was pointed out by the Permanent Court of
International Justice in the “Lotus” case:

“Now the first and foremost restriction imposed by international
law upon a State is that — failing the existence of a permissive rule
to the contrary — it may not exercise its power in any form in the
territory of another State. In this sense jurisdiction is certainly terri-
torial; it cannot be exercised by a State outside its territory except by
virtue of a permissive rule derived from international custom or
from a convention.

In these circumstances, all that can be required of a State is that it
should not overstep the limits which international law places upon
its jurisdiction; within these limits, its title to exercise jurisdiction
rests in its sovereignty.” !>4

A territorial jurisdiction conceived in this way suggests, as a general
rule, the territorial character of the State’s obligation in terms of imple-
mentation of an international legal norm, both in prescriptive and enforce-
ment terms. If this were not the case, norm on territorial integrity and
sovereignty, also having the character of jus cogens, would be violated.

102. What is the status of the Genocide Convention? With respect to
the obligation of prevention of the crime of genocide, the Convention
does not contain the principle of universal repression. It has firmly opted
for the territorial principle of the obligation of prevention and

“the only action relating to crimes committed outside the territory of
the Contracting Party is by organs of the United Nations within the
scope of the general competence” 155,

Accordingly,

“the States are . . . obliged to punish persons charged with the com-
mission of acts coming under the Convention insofar as they were
committed in their territory” !*6.

Article VII of the draft Genocide Convention, prepared by the Secre-
tary-General, was based on the concept of universal repression!” In its
draft Convention the 4d Hoc Committee on Genocide replaced the text
of Article VII, hence “the principle of universal repression was rejected
by the Committee by 4 votes (among which were France, the United

States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) against 2
with 1 abstention” !*,

An unfavourable position regarding the principle of universal punish-
ment emerges also from declarations and reservations concerning the
Genocide Convention !'°°, Communication of Governments'®® and by
non-governmental organizations that have a consultative status with the
Economic and Social Council !é!,

The Special Rapporteur concluded that

“since no international criminal court has been established, the ques-
tion of universal punishment should be reconsidered, if it is decided
to prepare new international instruments for the prevention and
punishment of genocide” '62.

The intention of the drafters of the Convention to establish territorial
obligations of States under the Convention clearly and irrefutably stems
from the provisions of Article XII of the Convention which reads:

“Any Contracting Party may at any time, by notification addressed
to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, extend the applica-
tion of the present Convention to all or any of the territories for the
conduct of whose foreign relations that Contracting Party is respon-
sible.” (Emphasis added.)

It is obvious that, if this were not the case, the said Article would be
deprived of all sense and logic.

103. Could a State be responsible for genocide? The Court finds, when
it refers to “the responsibility of a State for genocide or for any of the
other acts enumerated in Article 111”, that Article IX does not exclude
any form of State responsibility, nor is

“the responsibility of a State for acts of its organs excluded by
Article IV of the Convention, which contemplates the commission
of an act of genocide by ‘rulers’ or ‘public officials’” (para. 32 of
the Judgment).

Such a position does not appear, in my opinion, to be tenable.

Article TV of the Genocide Convention, which stipulates criminal
responsibility for genocide or the other acts enumerated in Article ITI of
the Convention, has a twofold meaning:

(a) a positive meaning, starting from the principle of individual guilt,
since Article IV establishes as criminally responsible “persons . . .

whether they are constitutionally appointed rulers, public officials or
private individuals”. This rule represents lex lata, because:

“International practice since the Second World War has con-
stantly applied the principle of individual criminal responsibility
for crimes of international law, including those of genocide” 6%,

(b) a negative meaning — contained in the exclusion of criminal respon-
sibility of States, governments or State authorities and the rejection
of the application of the doctrine of the act of the State in this
matter. Such a solution is expressed in the positive international law.
The International Law Commission, when elaborating the Draft
Code of Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind, con-
cluded, inter alia, in relation to the content ratione personae of the
Draft Code that:

“With regard to the content ratione personae, the Commission
took the view that its efforts at this stage should be devoted exclu-
sively to the criminal responsibility of individuals. This approach
was dictated by the uncertainty still attaching to the problem of
criminal responsibility of States . . . True, the criminal responsi-
bility of individuals does not eliminate the international responsi-
bility of States for the acts committed by persons acting as organs
or agents of the State. But, such responsibility is of a different
nature and falls within the traditional concept of State responsi-
bility . . . the question of international criminal responsibility
should be limited, at least at the present stage, to that of
individuals.” "6

The resolution built into Article TV of the Genocide Convention repre-
sents an expression of a broader understanding of the inability to establish
the criminal responsibility of legal persons (societas delinquere non potest).

The understanding is based on the premise that a criminal offence as a
phenomenon is reduced to a human action, that is to say, to a physical
act or to its omission. Since States are legal entities of an abstract char-
acter, persons without a physical body and incapable of criminal liability,
they thus cannot be guilty as perpetrators of criminal acts.

It is hardly necessary to state that the interest of safeguarding the
essential values of the international community involves the issue of
criminal responsibility of a State as illustrated, inter alia, by the Draft

163 Study of the Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,

Code of Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind '%.
Theoretically, the issue of criminal responsibility of a State may be
situated within the framework of a pure model of a State authority or
State as the offender, namely in the framework of collective, simultaneous
responsibility of a State as a legal person and physical personality, as
its political representative.

However, the above are just projects which, irrespective of their rele-
vance, have not yet found a place within positive international law. This
fact per se, irrrespective of the circumstances of a concrete case, renders
the Court, as an authority implementing positive law to subject cases,
incapable of taking such projects into account or accepting them as rele-
vant. If this were not the case, the Court would step away from its fun-
damental judicial function and penetrate into the legislative or quasi-
legislative area 1%.

104. Even in the hypothesis that, tractu temporis, since the Genocide
Convention came into force, criminal responsibility for genocide or for
any of the other acts enumerated in Article III has been extended to
States as well, the relevance of such a change to the subject case could be
highly questionable.

The rationale of such a question is the nature of the compromissory
clause contained in Article IX of the Genocide Convention. The estab-
lishment of jurisdiction of the Court for disputes concerning the interpre-
tation, application or fulfilment of the Convention is undoubtedly
precedent to the general rule of an optional character of the Court’s juris-
diction in international law. This fact has a dual meaning — legal and
meta-legal. In legal terms, precedent has to be strictly interpreted '¢’, par-
ticularly when it comes to the restriction of the sovereign rights of States.
In this case, the jurisdiction of the Court is founded in relation to dis-
putes “relating to the interpretation, application or fulfilment of the
present Convention” (emphasis added). In other words, the Court has, on
the basis of Article IX of the Convention, jurisdiction to settle disputes
relating to the relevant provisions of the Convention but not such disputes
concerning the rules as might possibly exist outside its frame.

Meta-legal meaning resides in the fact that the extension of the
Court’s jurisdiction beyond the provisions of Article IX of the Conven-
tion would, in normal reasoning, inhibit the States in other cases. An
evident readiness of States to accept the binding jurisdiction of the

165 Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1976, Vol. 11, Part Two, pp. 7-18.

166 “the enormity of the crime of genocide can hardly be exaggerated, and any treaty
for its repression deserves the most generous interpretation; but the Genocide Con-
vention is an instrument which is intended to produce legal effects by creating legal
obligations between the parties to it” (Reservations to the Convention on the Preven-
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports
1951, joint dissenting opinion of Judges Guerrero, Sir Arnold McNair, Read and
Hsu Mo, p. 47).

167 P.C.1J., Series A, No. 7, p. 76.



Court on a broad basis would be strengthened by such a move on the
part of the Court.
105. Article IX of the Convention stipulates that:

“Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpre-
tation, application or fulfilment of the present Convention, including
those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or for any
of the other acts enumerated in article III, shall be submitted to the
International Court of Justice at the request of any of the parties to
the dispute.”

If one attempts to determine the genuine meaning of the wording “respon-
sibility of a State for genocide or for any of the other acts enumerated in
article III”, several elements are of crucial importance.

(a) Article TX by its nature is a standard compromissory clause. As a
procedural provision, it aims at determining the jurisdiction of the Court
within the co-ordinates of “interpretation, application or fulfilment” of
the material provisions of the Convention. Hence, interpretations of
Article IX of the Convention may not in concreto go beyond the provi-
sions on individual criminal responsibility stipulated in Article IV of the
Convention (see para. 101 above). As is forcefully expressed in the joint
separate opinion of Judges Sir Percy Spender and Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice
in the South West Africa case:

“The principle of interpretation directed to giving provisions their
maximum effect cannot legitimately be employed in order to intro-
duce what would amount to a revision of those provisions.” 68

(b) The wording “responsibility of a State for genocide or for any of
the other acts enumerated in article III” is abstract and broad in its
vagueness, particularly in terms of the convention on criminal law “in
which care should be taken to avoid giving the State a fictitious legal
character, a procedure which should only be used in civil or commercial
matters” '%®. What is more, the wording “responsibility of a State” is
incorporated into the procedural provisions of the Genocide Convention.
It is not used, however, in the operative part of the Convention to denote
a possible consequence of committing the crime of genocide. The reason
for such a solution is obviously to be traced in the option for individual
criminal responsibility for genocide or related punishable acts.

For, as Manley Hudson concludes:

“The article goes further, however, in ‘including’ among such dis-
putes ‘those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or
any of the other acts enumerated in Article III’. As no other provi-
sion in the Convention deals expressly with State responsibility, it is

168 1. C.J. Reports 1962, p. 468.
169 N. Ruhashyankiko, op. cit., p. 82, para. 314.



difficult to see how a dispute concerning such responsibility can be
included among disputes relating to the interpretation or application
or fulfilment of the Convention. In view of the undertaking of the
parties in Article I to prevent genocide, it is conceivable that a dis-
pute as to State responsibility may be a dispute as to fulfilment of
the Convention. Yet read as a whole, the Convention refers to the
punishment of individuals only; the punishment of a State is not
adumbrated in any way, and it is excluded from Article V by which
the parties undertake to enact punitive legislation. Hence the ‘respon-
sibility of a State” referred to in Article IX is not criminal liability.” 7

The genuine meaning of the wording “responsibility of a State” should
hence be traced within the responsibility for the obligations entered into
by the parties under the Convention. Primary responsibilities of the
parties have been stipulated in Articles V and VI, and covering:

— an obligation to enact necessary legislation to give effect to the pro-
visions of the Convention; and

— the obligation of instituting legal proceedings for punishable acts pro-
vided for by Article III of the Convention against persons charged in
a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was
committed.

Obligations of the Contracting Parties “to enact . . . the necessary
legislation” and to punish persons who commit génocide and related
acts constitute a form of international responsibility of the State, responsi-
bility towards crucial interest of the international community as a
whole, built into the norm prohibiting genocide.

Given the nature of these obligations, one could hardly disagree with
the Special Rapporteur, Mr, N. Ruhashyankiko, that “at the present
stage in the development of international criminal law, the State can bear
only political responsibility for international crimes”'?!, or perhaps, in
more precise terms, the State can bear primarily political responsibility
for a failure to perform obligations concerning the prohibition and pun-
ishment of international crimes.

{e) The qualification of a State as a responsible entity for the crime of
genocide as a primarily political responsibility is not a priori exclusive of
the civil responsibility of a State. The civil responsibility of a State in the
matter of genocide may assume two forms of expression:

170 M. M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, 1908, p. 857.

171 Study of the Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,
prepared by Mr, N. Ruhashyankiko, Special Rapporteur, doc. E/CN 4/Sub.27416, 4 July
1978, p. 38, para. 159.



(i) civil responsibility for the crime of genocide committed in its own
State territory; and

(ii) civil responsibility for the crime of genocide committed in the terri-
tory of another State.

In the eventuality contemplated by (i) above, it would be civil respon-
sibility under internal law which is to be considered and adjudicated in its
entirety by the internal judicial authorities of a contracting party.

A case falling under (ii) above would be different in terms of quality.
Leaving aside the conditions in which a State may be responsible for
genocide perpetrated in the territory of another State, civil responsibility
would be characterized by two stages. The first stage would comprise a
claim for reparations to the competent authorities of the State respon-
sible for genocide and adjudicated in the procedure established by its own
internal law. The second stage would involve an international litigation
for the reparation of losses incurred by genocide, the parties to it being
the State responsible for genocide and the State on whose territory geno-
cide was perpetrated. In other words, it would be a case of the typical

-international civil responsibility of a State. Given the fact that the
national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as an object safeguarded from
the crime of genocide, has no locus standi in the Court, the State on
whose territory the crime has been perpetrated should espouse the cause
of the “national, ethnic, racial or religious” group after having exhausted
local legal remedies.

1 am convinced that the Genocide Convention provided for no interna-
tional civil responsibility of States for the crime of genocide. Such a stand-
ing of the Convention on the matter of international responsibility may of
course be qualified in more than one way, but it is difficult to infer any
conclusion on the force of the concept of international civil responsibility
within the fibre of the Convention, unless one strays into the area of legal
construction. It is easy to accept the view that the international civil
responsibility of States for the crime of genocide would strengthen the
effectiveness of prohibition of the crime of genocide. However, in the
present case, the question is reduced to the qualification of positive
law concerning responsibility for genocide and not to the qualification
of optimal solutions in abstracto. As suggested by Special Rapporteur
Whitaker

“when the Convention is revised consideration shall be given to
including provisions for a State responsibility for genocide together
with reparations” 72,


106. With regard to the sixth preliminary objection raised by Yugosla-
via, the Court finds that:

“Bosnia and Herzegovina could become a party to the Conven-
tion through the mechanism of State succession. Moreover, the
Secretary-General of the United Nations considered that this had
been the case” (para. 20 of the Judgment)

and that

“the Court does not consider it necessary, in order to decide on its
jurisdiction in this case, to make a determination on the legal issues
concerning State succession in respect to treaties which have been
raised by the Parties. Whether Bosnia and Herzegovina automati-
cally became party to the Genocide Convention on the date of its
accession to independence on 6 March 1992, or whether it became a
party as a result — retroactive or not — of its Notice of Succession
of 29 December 1992, at all events it was a party to it on the date of
the filing of its Application on 20 March 1993.” (Para. 23 of the
Judgment.)

107. I must say that, in my view, the opposite is the case. No one
denies that Bosnia and Herzegovina “could become a party to the Con-
vention through the mechanism of State succession”. However, the real
question is not whether Bosnia and Herzegovina “could have become a
party”, for every new State has in principle that possibility, but whether it
became a party to the Convention through the succession mechanism. The
fact that the Secretary-General “considered that this had been the case”
is not of decisive importance, as the scope of depositary functions is
clearly defined in positive international law. As stated in the Commen-
tary to Article 77 (Functions of Depositaries) of the Convention on the
Law of Treaties:

a depositary has a certain duty to examine whether signatures,
instruments and reservations are in conformity with any applicable
provisions of the treaty or of the present articles, and if necessary to
bring the matter to the attention of the State in question. That is,
however, the limit of the depositary’s duty in this connexion. It is no
part of the functions to adjudicate on the validity of an instrument or
reservation.” 7

In other words it is firmly established that “the depositary is not invested

173 UNCLT, First and Second Sessions, Vienna, 26 March-24 May 1968 and 9 April-
22 May 1969, Official Records Documents of the Conference, p. 89, para. 4 (emphasis
added).




with any competence to adjudicate upon or to determine matters arising in
connexion with the performance of its functions”.

In my opinion, the Court had to consider whether Bosnia and Herze-
govina had become a party to the Convention on the basis of succession,
at least vis-a-vis Yugoslavia, for two reasons:

— in the formal sense, there exists a dispute between Bosnia and Herze-
govina and Yugoslavia in that the positions of the parties to the dis-
pute in relation to “automatic succession” are radically opposed.
While Bosnia and Herzegovina considers automatic succession to be
a feature of positive international law and therefore contends that “it
has automatically succeeded to the Genocide Convention” 75, Yugo-
slavia denies this, claiming that “the ‘clean slate’ rule has been and
remains in force as a rule of customary international law for new
States” !76,

(It should be noted that expressions such as “automatic succession
to the Genocide Convention” or “has automatically succeeded to the
Genocide Convention” are not sufficiently precise and are, conse-
quently, incorrect. The objects of succession are not treaties as legal
acts but concern the status of the parties to the concrete treaty and/or
the rights and obligations stipulated by that treaty. If treaties as legal
acts were the object of succession, then succession would also apply
to treaties whose obligation has been performed, for they are as valid
as before, albeit merely of historical interest, which is clearly not the
case.)

— in the material sense, as Bosnia and Herzegovina did not express its
consent to be bound by the Convention in the way prescribed by
Article XI of the Convention, the rules of succession are the only
possible basis on which Bosnia and Herzegovina could be considered
a party to the Genocide Convention.

108. The Genocide Convention, by its nature, is a convention in the
field of international criminal law. This is something which results from
the very nature of the matter, and which hardly needs arguing. À conven-
tion which has, as its subject, the definition and punishment of genocide
as a crime under international law, and whose provisions are imple-
mented through national criminal legislation, could hardly be defined in
a different way. Another consideration is that in a community like the
international community, many conventions and other international legal
acts have a direct or indirect humanitarian meaning. Such a meaning of

174 UNCLT, First and Second Sessions, Vienna, 26 March-24 May 1968 and 9 April-
22 May 1969, Official Records, Documents of the Conference, p. 89, para. 8 (emphasis added).

liminary Objections, 14 November 1995, para. 6.9 at p. 111 (emphasis added).

international legal acts results unavoidably from the fact that, in the final
analysis, the international community is genus humanum, that in a system
whose original and basic subjects are abstract beings, the individual rep-
resents the final addressee of the legal rules. However, it could not be
concluded from that that the Genocide Convention is a humanitarian
convention, a convention which belongs to humanitarian law, because
that term denotes the rules contained in conventions and international
customs whose subject is “to reduce or limit the suffering of individuals,
and to circumscribe the area within which the savagery of armed conflicts
is permissible” 7? (in that sense it should be noted that the full name of
the Geneva Conference of 1974-1977 which adopted Protocols I and II
was “Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of
Internatienal Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts™).

The qualification of a convention or of other international legal acts as
“humanitarian”, on the basis of the direct or indirect significance of that
convention for the legal status of individuals, would make the predomi-
nant part of international law a “humanitarian law”. Exempli causa, the
“humanitarian law” understood in such a way would include the instru-
ments which regulate the position of the minorities, the right of peoples
to self-determination, the conventions which punish acts of terrorism,
and, in general, all conventions in the field of international criminal law.

The term “humanitarian convention” or “convention of humanitarian
character” is used, so it seems, in order to stress the importance of the
convention. However, terms like “humanitarian convention”, “conven-
tion on human rights”, etc., do not, logically speaking, denote the legal
force of the convention, but rather its appurtenance to a species, in the
system of international law. The importance of a convention may rather
be expressed by other qualifications — in this concrete case by the
qualification according to which the Genocide Convention represents a
“general multilateral convention of universal interest”,

109. Article 34 (Succession of States in Cases of Separation of Parts of
a State) of the Convention on Succession in respect of Treaties (1978)
stipulates inter alia:

“1. When a part or parts of the territory. of a State separate to
form one or more States, whether or not the predecessor State con-
tinues to exist:

fa) any treaty in force at the date of the succession of States in
respect of the entire territory of the predecessor State continues
in force in respect of each successor State so formed”.

The relevant provision of the cited Article has been formulated in terms
of automatic succession. Theoretically, it corresponds to the concept of

Y% I. G. Starke, Introduction to International Law, 1989, p. 553.




universal succession based on a strict analogy with the notion of inheri-
tance in civil law and/or the concept on legal succession (substitution +
continuation) according to which ‘‘the successor State under interna-
tional law succeeds to its predecessor’s rights and obligations, which
become its own” [translation by the Registry] "7,

In concreto, the fundamental question is the qualification of the term
“automatic succession” as stipulated by Article 34 of the Convention on
Succession in respect of Treaties (1978), i.e., does it constitute lex lata, a
part of positive international law — or not?

110. The answer to the fundamental question thus posed implies:

(a) a qualification of the solution established by Article 34 (1) of the
Convention from the standpoint of treaty law;

(b) a qualification of that solution from the standpoint of the practice
of States prior to the adoption of the Convention on Succession in
respect of Treaties;

(c) a qualification of the practice of States after the Convention was
adopted at the diplomatic conference in Vienna in August 1978.

Article 34 (Succession of States in Cases of Separation of Parts of a
State) is an integral part of the Convention on Succession in respect of
Treaties, hence the rule contained in it is a treaty rule and shares the fate
of the Convention itself. Article 49 (Entry into Force) of the Convention
stipulates that:

“1. The present Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth
day following the date of deposit of the fifteenth instrument of rati-
fication or accession.”

Since the condition for the coming into force of the Convention has not
been fulfilled, the Convention has not become a part of the positive legal
milieu. Consequently, the rule contained in Article 34 (1) is in a state of
lex ferenda.

The rule contained in Article 34 (1) could, naturally, be lex lata outside
the framework of the Convention as an expression of existing customary
law. Does this rule merit the qualification of a customary rule?

The generally held view of customary law, endorsed by this Court !”°, is
that the creation of a rule of customary international law postulates:
“two constitutive elements: (1) a general practice of States, and (2) the
acceptance by States of the general practice as law” #0,

the predecessor State continues to exist suggests two principal conclu-
sions:

(a) In quantitative terms it is difficult, if not impossible, to speak of a
generalized practice in this respect. As the ILC loyally notes in its com-
mentary on Article 33 (Succession of States in Cases of Separation of
Parts of a State) and Article 34 (Position of a State Continues after Sepa-
ration of Part of Its Territory) of its Draft: “During the United Nations
period cases of separation resulting in the creation of a newly indepen-
dent State . . . have been comparatively few.” '8! Previous practice does
not substantively affect the argument because “[blefore the era of the
United Nations, colonies were considered as being in the fullest sense ter-
ritories of the colonial power”, hence, “some of the earlier precedents
usually cited . . . in cases of secession concerned secession of colonies” !82,
One could rather, and with greater justification, speak of a certain
number of precedents;

(b) These precedents in the qualitative sense have in common an iden-
tical position regarding treaties of the predecessor State — new States
were neither bound nor entitled ipso jure to the continuance of pre-
independence treaties. In relation to the period prior to the foundation of
the United Nations,

“[t}he majority of writers take the view, supported by State practice,
that a newly independent State begins its life with a clean slate,
except in regard to ‘local’ or ‘real’ obligations” !8,

The practice in the United Nations era is presented in the commentary on
Article 33 of the Draft (Article 34 of the Convention) with the cases of
Pakistan and Singapore. The case of Pakistan is qualified as the applica-
tion of the principle that on separation such a State has a “clean slate” in
the sense that it is not under any obligation to accept the continuance in
force of its predecessor’s treaties '®*. As far as Singapore is concerned, in
spite of the “devolution agreement” of 1965, it “adopted a posture simi-
lar to that of other newly independent States”, that is, “[w}hile ready to
continue Federation treaties in force, Singapore regarded that continu-
ance as a matter of mutual consent” 185,

The ILC viewed the case of Pakistan as a “special one” '* probably
because it prompted a legal opinion of the United Nations Secretariat.
The relevant part of the opinion reads:

“1. From the viewpoint of international law, the situation is one
in which part of an existing State breaks off and becomes a new
State. On this analysis there is no change in the international status
of India; it continues as a State with all treaty rights and obligations
of membership in the United Nations. The territory which breaks
off, Pakistan, will be a new State, it will not have the treaty rights
and obligations of the old State . . .

In international law the situation is analogous to the separation of
the Irish Free State from Britain, and of Belgium from the Nether-
lands. In these cases the portion which separated was considered a

new State; the remaining portion continued as an existing State with
all the rights and duties which it had before.” '87

This legal opinion was given in connection with the concrete issue con-
cerning Pakistan’s position in relation to the Charter of the United
Nations, but its wording and argumentation clearly indicate that it was
designed as an opinion of principle. In any event, there are clear indica-
tions that States interpreted it as a principled position of the United
Nations with regard to the relationship of a part of a State territory
which breaks off and becomes a new State, to the treaty rights and obli-
gations of the old State's,

111. It would appear that the main methodological approach of the
Commission in drafting Article 34 of the Convention was based on the
drawing of a distinction between two things:

(a) the obligation of the new State to continue to apply the treaties of
its predecessor to its territory after the succession of States; and,

188 In the note verbale of its Permanent Mission to the United Nations received on
11 September 1963, the Government of Afghanistan bases its assertion that “Pakistan is
not a successor té British treaty rights because Pakistan is a new State” precisely on the
argument that the Secretary-General of the United Nations “denied the right of succes-
sion” to Pakistan — United Nations, Legislative Series, Materials on Succession of
States, 1967 (ST/LEG/SER.B/14), p. 2, para. 3 {a} and footnote |.




(b) the right of the new State to consider itself a party to those treaties
in its own name after the succession of States '%.

The Commission proceeded explicitly from this distinction in formu-
lating the provisions of Article 15 of the Draft Convention which stipu-
lates that:

“A newly independent State is not bound to maintain in force, or
to become a party to, any treaty by reason only of the fact that at
the date of the succession of States the treaty was in force in respect
of the territory to which the succession of States relates.”

If the Commission was guided by the practice of States in formulating
the provisions of Articles 15 and 33 of the Draft (Articles 16 and 34 of
the Convention) then a complete analogy has to be applied when one is
determining the consequences of succession in the case of the creation of
a newly independent State by secession from the metropolis and the cre-
ation of a State by the separation of parts of an existing State. In par-
ticular, in the period prior to the United Nations era, cases of “secession”
concerned the “secession of colonies” '?°. In other words this is a virtually
uniform practice, the practice in the case of Pakistan and Singapore, the
only cases cited in the commentary to Article 33 of the Draft to illustrate
the practice during the United Nations period, being characterized as the
“clean slate” rule.

Making a distinction between the consequences of succession in the
case of a newly independent State the territory of which immediately
before the date of succession was a dependent territory, and the case of a
new State formed by separation of a part of an existing State, and estab-
lishing different rules for these two cases — “clean slate” in the former
and “automatic continuity” in the latter — the Convention undoubtedly
went beyond the sphere of codification of existing practice and entered
the sphere of progressive development.

The provision on “automatic continuity” could hardly be justified in a
convention on succession even in the event that the new States, following
the logic of the right to consider themselves as parties to the treaties in
their own name after the succession of States, had uniformly accepted the
rights and obligations stemming from the treaties of the predecessor
State.

The very fact that we are dealing with the right of the new State “to
consider itself a party to the treaties in its own name” (emphasis added),
a right that has been operationalized in conformity with the rules of

treaty law based on the fundamental principle of consent, eliminates,
within the logic of codification of existing practice, the construction on
“automatic continuity” which is, by its meaning, an obligation. What
could be open to debate as we are dealing with a right or authorization is
whether that right or authorization, depending on the nature of the prac-
tice, is an ordinary or categorical authorization (jus cogens). Even the
uniform exercise of a right does not provide grounds for transforming the
right into an obligation. Per analogiam, if on the basis of the authorizing
norm contained in Article 33 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea
(1982) a large majority of States were to proclaim a contiguous zone, that
would not mean that the establishment of the zone would constitute an
obligation of States. The consequences of such a practice would be the
constitution of customary rules on the right of States to proclaim exclu-
sive economic zones or in concreto the customary rule on the right of the
successor State “to consider itself as a party to the predecessor State’s
treaties in its own name”.

It is therefore not difficult to agree with the opinion of the Expert Con-
sultant of the Conference, Sir Francis Vallat, that

“[t]he rule [in Article 2 — Succession of States in Case of Separation
of Parts of a State] was not based either on established practice or on
precedent, it was a matter of the progressive development of inter-
national law rather than of codification” !°!,

It was noted that, in the case of Article 34 of the Convention

“the International Law Commission abandoned the ‘clean slate’
principle and introduced, on the contrary, a rule of continuity. It
was clear that in doing so it had been aware of the fact that it was
not simply reflecting the present state of the law, but was proposing
progressive development. For ‘clean slate’ was part of general inter-
national law and would continue to be so, whatever solution was
adopted in the Convention.” 192

Multilateral law-making conventions do not represent an exception since:

“Succession to multilateral law-making conventions after separa-
tion or secession is a right, not an obligation. Multilateral law-mak-
ing conventions establish a body of rules of international law. They
do not create subjective rights of individual states. In case of succes-
sion no acquired right of a third party need be protected, by making
it the successor’s responsibility to perform it. No automatic change

23 August 1978, pp. 52-55.




of attribution; in other words: no automatic succession, therefore,
takes place.” !°3

Finally, it is also worth examining the practice of States following the
adoption on 22 August 1978 of the Convention on Succession in respect
of Treaties, which was open for signature until 28 February 1979.
Article 46 (Signature) of Chapter VIT of the Convention stipulates

“The present Convention shall be open for signature by all States
until 28 February 1979 at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs
of the Republic of Austria, and subsequently, until 31 August 1979,
at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.”

The position of States regarding the Convention could hardly, even
given a maximum degree of benevolence, be described as satisfactory. In
the almost twenty years since the Convention was opened to ratification
and accession, only 13 States have deposited instruments of ratification,
accession or succession, so that not even the obviously modest require-
ment of 15 instruments of ratification or accession for the Convention to
enter into effect has been fulfilled. This fact — volens nolens — is indica-
tive of the attitude of States towards the Convention, regardless of the
fact that the number of ratifications or accessions cannot, in itself, be
considered conclusive with regard to the acceptance of the rules con-
tained in a Convention which has not come into force. The practice of
new States which have emerged since 1993 clearly shows that automatic
succession is not accepted as a positive rule (Multilateral Treaties Depos-
ited with the Secretary-General, Status as at 31 December 1993).

112. It follows from the above that the rule on automatic succession of
multilateral treaties — lex ferenda, as matters now stand — has not been
accepted in positive international law. However, it would be wrong to
conclude from this that a new State begins life in the international com-
munity as a tabula rasa, a newborn in a legal vacuum deprived of all
treaty rights and obligations. Such a state of affairs would be in contra-
diction with the very idea of an organized, de jure international commu-
nity, an idea which does not recognize or tolerate the existence of any
entity which is not directly or indirectly subject to the rule of law.

Moreover, treaty rights and obligations are subject to the division of
rights and obligations effected in the well-known dictum of the Court in the
case concerning Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited:

“[a]n essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations
of a State toward the international community as a whole, and those

l'Académie de droit international de La Haye, Vol. 116, 1965, p. 233.




arising vis-à-vis another State . . . By their very nature, the former
are the concern of all States.” 4

(Modern international law does not take the classical view according
to which only custom, as a formal source, may originally constitute a
norm of general international law, whereas a rule created by treaty, per
definitionem, represents a particular norm which may possibly acquire
the status of a norm of general international law tractu temporis by
means of custom. This view played its part when the international
community was primitive and undeveloped and when constructions
like this were required to fill in the vast gaps in the positive law. Today
such a concept is untenable both in theory and from the standpoint of
positive law.

Theoretically, if it is righily considered that the basis of the binding
nature of general international law is the “will of the international
community as a whole”, general custom and comprehensive multilat-
eral treaties are only the instrumentalization of that will. Their mutual
relationship in value terms is determined by the inherent capacity of
both sources to express that will. Any other approach implicitly intre-
duces dualism into the foundation of the binding nature of interna-
tional law for it is obvious that neither general custom nor general
multilateral treaties imply unanimity, the agreement of all States. There-
fore, to recognize custom as having an exclusive role in the generation
of general international law is tantamount to a metaphysical joke
{Lauterpacht speaks of “the mysterious phenomenon of customary
international law which is deemed to be a source of law only on condi-
tion that it is in accordance with law” (“Sovereignty over Submarine
Areas”, 27 British Year Book of International Law 376, p. 394 (19503);
he also raises the question of “why custom is binding, The answer,
beyond which it is in law not possible to go, is that it is the will of the
international community that international law, in its various manifes-
tations, shall be binding” (H. Lauterpacht, International Law, Col-
lected Papers, 1, General Works, 1970, p. 58).

In positive legal terms, the capacity of general multilateral treaties to
generate norms jus cogens superveniens has been established by the
Convention on the Law of Treaties. The commentary on Article 50 of
the Draft (Article 53 of the Convention) says inter alia: “a modifica-
tion of a rule of jus cogens would today most probably be effected
through a general multilateral treaty” — Yearbook of the International
Law Commission, 1966, Vol. 11, p. 248, para. 4. If a general multi-
lateral treaty is capable of creating a norm of jus cogens, as the most
perfect part of international law, then à fortiori it is capable of gen-
erating a norm of general international law.)

194 J C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32.



General multilateral treaties adopted in the interest of the international
community, being the instrumental form of expression of the will of the
international community as a whole, operate erga omnes independently
of contractual approval. The Genocide Convention is a case in point. As
indicated by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion
concerning Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide, proceeding from the qualification of
genocide as “a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups”
which “is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United
Nations”, “the principles underlying the Convention . . . are recognized
by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional
obligation”,

Hence, the principles underlying the Genocide Convention are part of
the corpus juris cogentis. Any new State is a priori subject to these rules
since they express the universal interest of the international community
as a whole,

113. The cited opinion of the Court raises a question of fundamental
importance for these concrete proceedings — the question of the relation-
ship between the principles underlying the Genocide Convention and the
provisions of the Genocide Convention. This question has two dimen-
sions — a quantitative and a qualitative one. The quantitative dimension
of the question has to do with the relationship between underlying prin-
ciples and the provisions of the Convention, i.e., whether those principles
apply to the Convention as a whole. The answer to this question can, in
my opinion, only be negative. The fundamental principles of interna-
tional law underlying the Genocide Convention are manifested only in
the substantive provisions of the Convention, the provisions defining its
object and purpose. The transitional and final provisions of the Conven-
tion, to which should be added the procedural provisions regarding
methods of settling disputes, are not such as to warrant being described
as expressing the spirit and letter of the fundamental principles of inter-
national law. This is corroborated not only by the possibility of express-
ing reservations regarding these provisions but also by the effect of
termination carried out in accordance with Article XIV of the Con-
vention.

In qualitative terms the relationship between the “principles underlying
the Convention” and the substantive provisions of the Convention is rele-

195 I. C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23 (emphasis added).

196 It might be concluded that, having in mind that nature of the principles underlying
the Genocide Convention, the then Secretary-General Hammarsjkold warned the Congo
authorities during United Nations operations in that country that the principles of the
Convention must be held to govern even a new State like the Congo and to apply to sub-
ordinate political authorities within the Congo State (Annual Report of the Secretary-
General 1960-1961, General Assembly, 16th Sess., Supp. No. 1, p. 11; Waldock, “General
Course on Public International Law”, Recueil des cours de l'Académie de droit interna-
tional de La Haye, Vol. 106, 1962, p. 228).




vant from the standpoint of whether the legal effect of those principles
covers the substantive provisions of the Convention, These provisions of
the Convention are the normative concretization of the “principles under-
lying the Convention”, the transformation of the general — for practical
purposes inoperable — categorical imperative into a series of concrete,
particular categorical imperatives in the form of specific substantive pro-
visions of the Convention.

In other words, the substantive provisions of the Genocide Conven-
tion, as the concretization of those principles, are interpretative in nature
so that they share the cogent nature of the principles underlying the Con-
vention,

If this were not the case, these lofty principles “recognized by civilized
States as binding on States” would remain in the air, as a kind of monu-
ment to good intentions which never came to fruition.

For, if the provisions of the Genocide Convention were not a concre-
tization of the principles underlving the Convention, the international
community would be faced with insurmountable legal obstacles in the

120. The position of the Court regarding its jurisdiction ratione tem-
poris can be summarized by the following part of paragraph 34 of the
Judgment, in which it finds:

“that the Genocide Convention — and in particular Article IX — does
not contain any clause the object or effect of which is to limit in such
manner the scope of its jurisdiction ratione temporis, and nor did the
Parties themselves make any reservation to that end, either to the Con-
vention or on the occasion of the signature of the Dayton-Paris Agree-
ment. The Court thus finds that it has jurisdiction in this case to give
effect to the Genocide Convention with regard to the relevant facts.”

Concerning the jurisdiction of the Court ratione temporis, the situation
is, in my opinion, clear — according to the rule of general international
law, expressed in paragraph 3 of Article 24 (Entry into Force) of the
Convention on the Law of Treaties:

“When the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is estab-
lished on a date after the treaty has come into force, the treaty enters
into force for that State on that date, unless the treaty otherwise pro-
vides.”

Article IX of the Genocide Convention is a procedural provision of the
Convention and, being an integral part of it, shares the Convention’s des-
tiny or, to put it more precisely, the destiny of its contractual provisions.
Consequently, if the Convention does not have a retroactive effect — and
it obviously does not — then its Article IX likewise has no such effect.
So, as the general rule of non-retroactivity stipulates, the Convention is
applied to the events and situations which took place after it had come
into effect in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina or, in the circumstances
of the present case, when the Convention became applicable between
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.

The analogy which the Court has drawn between this case and Mav-
rommatis Palestine Concessions (para. 26 of the Judgment) does not
seem convincing. One can rather speak of an analogy between this case
and the Ambatielos case to the effect that:

“To accept this theory would mean giving retroactive effect to
Article 29 of the Treaty of 1926, whereas Article 32 of this Treaty
states that the Treaty, which must mean all the provisions of the Treaty,
shall come into force immediately upon ratification. Such a conclu-
sion might have been rebutted if there had been any special clause or
any special object necessitating retroactive interpretation. There is
no such clause or object in the present case. It is therefore impossible
to hold that any of its provisions must be deemed to have been in
force earlier.”

2H Ambatielos, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 40 (emphasis
added).




For, as it is clearly stated in the commentary on Article 24 of the Con-
vention on the Law of Treaties:

“when a jurisdictional clause is attached to the substantive clauses of
a treaty as a means of securing their due application, the non-retro-
activity principle may operate to limit ratione temporis the applica-
tion of the jurisdictional clause. Thus in numerous cases under the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fun-
damental Freedoms, the European Commission of Human Rights
had held that it is incompetent to entertain complaints regarding
alleged violations of human rights said to have occurred prior to the
entry into force of the Convention with respect to the State in ques-
tion.” 212

On the basis of the foregoing, I take the liberty of concluding that, in
my opinion, the relevant conditions for the entertainment of the case by
the Court, relating both to jurisdiction and to admissibility, have not
been met.
