                      1. Much to my regret, I am unable to concur with the decision of the
                    Court that The Gambia has standing in the present case, which leads me
                    to vote against paragraph 115 (4) and (5). Pursuant to Article 57 of the
                    Statute, I will explain the reasons for my dissent.

                       2. The Gambia’s institution of the proceedings against Myanmar
                    before the Court for the protection of the common interest of the States
                    parties to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
                    of Genocide (hereinafter the “Genocide Convention” or the “Conven-
                    tion”) is, in essence, a collective lawsuit, which renders this case excep-
                    tional. Notwithstanding its purported objective, The Gambia’s legal action
                    raises some fundamental issues that bear on the statutory framework
                    of the judicial mechanism for dispute settlement under the Charter of
                    the United Nations. The way in which Article IX of the Genocide Con­
                    vention is being interpreted in the Judgment, in my opinion, deviates
                    from the rules on treaty interpretation and the settled jurisprudence of the
                    Court with regard to the Genocide Convention.


                             I. Access to the Court and the Nature of the Case

                       3. In its first preliminary objection, the Respondent claims that the
                    Court lacks jurisdiction, or alternatively that the Application is inadmis-
                    sible, because the real applicant in these proceedings is the Organisation
                    of Islamic Cooperation (hereinafter the “OIC”), which cannot be a party
                    to proceedings before the Court pursuant to Article 34, paragraph 1, of
                    the Statute. It argues that this objection concerns both law and fact.

                       4. Myanmar’s first preliminary objection raises a substantive issue,
                    namely, whether the Court is competent under the Statute to entertain a
                    case which is in fact initiated by an international organization and
                    entrusted to one of its members to act on its behalf. The evidence and
                    documents adduced by the Respondent, in my view, sufficiently prove
                    that The Gambia was tasked and appointed by the OIC to institute the
                    proceedings against Myanmar in the Court. This is not only supported by
                    the resolutions adopted by the OIC, but also publicly acknowledged by
                    its Member States, in particular The Gambia itself. As is recalled in the
                    Judgment, The Gambia expressly announced in the United Nations Gen-
                    eral Assembly that “it would champion an accountability mechanism for
                    the alleged crimes against the Rohingya” and “lead concerted efforts to

                    521 	 application of the genocide convention (diss. op. xue)

                    take the Rohingya issue to the International Court of Justice on behalf of
                    the Organization of Islamic Cooperation” (United Nations, Official
                    Records of the General Assembly, UN doc. A/74/PV.8, 26 September 2019,
                    p. 31, emphasis added (Judgment, paras. 69 and 73)). Being the chair of
                    the Ad hoc Ministerial Committee on Accountability for Human Rights
                    Violations against the Rohingyas established by resolution No. 59/45-
                    POL of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers in May 2018, The Gambia
                    is specifically instructed and directed by the OIC to take legal action in
                    the International Court of Justice. Moreover, the decision to file a case in
                    the Court was negotiated and agreed upon among its members, particu-
                    larly with regard to the representation and funding of the envisaged legal
                    action (OIC, Report of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Committee on Human
                    Rights Violations against the Rohingya, 25 September 2019; OIC, resolu-
                    tion No. 59/47-POL on the Work of the OIC Ad Hoc Ministerial Com-
                    mittee on Accountability for Human Rights Violations against the
                    Rohingyas, November 2020; OIC Secretary General Thanks the ISF for
                    its Support in Financing the Rohingya Case at the ICJ, OIC press release,
                    7 October 2020).


                        5. The Gambia does not deny those facts but maintains that it insti-
                    tuted the proceedings in its own name and has a dispute with Myanmar
                    regarding “its own rights” as a State party to the Genocide Convention.
                    Notably, The Gambia does not claim any link with the alleged acts in
                    Myanmar. In its own words, it has no individual interest in the case but
                    acts for the common interest of the States parties. Given its character,
                    The Gambia’s legal action, either for the common interest of the OIC
                    Member States, or for the common interest of the States parties to the
                    Genocide Convention, is arguably tantamount to a public-­            interest
                    ­litigation.
                        6. In rejecting the Respondent’s first preliminary objection, the Court
                     simply dismisses as irrelevant Myanmar’s evidence relating to the OIC’s
                     decision and its financial support for The Gambia’s legal action. In the
                     Court’s view, those factors do not detract from The Gambia’s status as
                     the Applicant before the Court, and The Gambia’s motivation to com-
                     mence the proceedings is irrelevant for establishing the jurisdiction of the
                     Court. This reasoning, in my view, is evasive of the real hard issue before
                     the Court.

                       7. Article 34, paragraph 1, of the Statute provides that “[o]nly States
                    may be parties in cases before the Court”. By virtue of that provision,
                    international organizations do not enjoy access to the Court. The issue in
                    the present case is not in whose name the proceedings are instituted, what
                    motive the Applicant may pursue, or who has arranged the litigation
                    team; no one has ever challenged The Gambia’s capacity to have access
                    to the Court. The matter for the Court to determine is whether The Gam-
                    bia is acting on behalf of the OIC for the common interest of its member


                    States, some of which are parties to the Genocide Convention, while o
                                                                                        ­ thers
                    are not. The evidence shows that the issue of the Rohingyas was never
                    considered as a bilateral dispute between The Gambia and Myanmar in
                    the OIC. It was the OIC, not The Gambia, which took the decision to
                    submit the issue of the Rohingyas to the International Court of Justice,
                    and The Gambia was entrusted to find a proper way to implement the
                    OIC’s decision. Although The Gambia independently made its decision
                    to institute proceedings in the Court, the fact remains that The Gambia’s
                    legal action is initiated by the OIC and that The Gambia is acting under
                    the mandate and with the financial support of the OIC.

                       8. To establish the existence of a bilateral dispute between the parties,
                    there must be some link — a territorial, national or other form of connec-
                    tion — between the applicant and the alleged acts of the respondent. This
                    linkage requirement has a substantive bearing on the merits phase. Alle-
                    gations of genocide or other genocidal acts require serious investigation
                    and proof. When the applicant has no link whatsoever with the alleged
                    acts, it is apparently difficult, if not impossible, for it to collect evidence
                    and conduct investigations on its own. Relying entirely on the evidence
                    and material sources collected by third parties, for example United Nations
                    organs, human rights bodies or the State concerned, only reinforces the
                    argument that the case is a public-­interest action, actio popularis. Such
                    action, even in the form of a bilateral dispute, may in fact allow interna-
                    tional organizations to have access to the Court in the future.

                       9. Although I agree with the Court’s finding that the conduct of
                    The Gambia to institute the proceedings before the Court does not amount
                    to an abuse of process, I doubt very much the Court’s conclusion that there
                    are no other grounds of inadmissibility which would require it to decline
                    the exercise of its jurisdiction (Judgment, para. 49). Judicial propriety,
                    in my view, is a relevant issue under the circumstances of the present case.
                    In the administration of justice, the Court must ensure that the princi-
                    ples of international adjudication be observed, both in form and in sub-
                    stance.
                       10. Under the Statute, the Court’s function in contentious cases is con-
                    fined to disputes between two or more States. The bilateral and adversarial
                    structure of the dispute settlement mechanism is reflected in the procedural
                    rules of the Court. Such rules are not suitable to entertain public-­interest
                    actions. When the applicant is in fact acting on behalf of an international
                    organization, albeit in its own name, the respondent may be placed in a
                    disadvantageous position before the Court. This is particularly true if sev-
                    eral judges on the bench are nationals of member States of the interna-
                    tional organization concerned. With the organization in the shadow,
                    inequality of the Parties may be hidden in the composition of the Court,
                    thereby undermining the principle of equality of the parties, one of the
                    fundamental principles of the Court for dispute settlement. However desir-
                    able it is to provide judicial protection to the victims of the alleged acts,


                    the respondent is entitled to a fair legal process in accordance with the
                    provisions of the Statute and the Rules of Court. For a comparison, refer-
                    ence may be made to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
                    (hereinafter “ITLOS”). Under Articles 20 and 37 of its Statute, ITLOS
                    and its Seabed Disputes Chamber shall be open to specific entities, includ-
                    ing certain international organizations. Article 22 of the Rules of the Tri-
                    bunal provides that an international organization which is a party to a
                    dispute before the Tribunal has the right to choose a judge ad hoc if there
                    is a judge of the nationality of a State that is the other party to the dispute
                    and if there is no judge of the nationality of one of the member States of
                    the international organization (Rules of the Tribunal, 25 March 2021,
                    ITLOS/8, Art. 22 (1)-(2)). Equally, “[w]here an international organization
                    is a party to a case and there is upon the bench a judge of the nationality
                    of a member State of the organization, the other party may choose a judge
                    ad hoc” (ibid., Art. 22 (3)). It is further provided that “[w]here two or more
                    judges on the bench are nationals of member States of the international
                    organization concerned . . . the President may . . . request one or more
                    such judges to withdraw” (ibid., Art. 22 (4)). Clearly, proper identification
                    of the character of a legal action before the Court directly concerns the
                    good administration of j­ustice.

                       11. Moreover, The Gambia’s legal action may challenge the principle
                    of finality in the adjudication of the dispute. Articles 59 and 60 of the
                    Statute provide that the decision of the Court has no binding force except
                    between the parties and in respect of that particular case and that the
                    decision of the Court shall be final and without appeal. In the present
                    case, if any State party has standing to take legal action in the Court for
                    the protection of the common interest of the States parties in compliance
                    with the obligations erga omnes partes of the Genocide Convention, one
                    may wonder whether the Court’s decision has binding force on all other
                    States parties as well. According to Article 59, the effect of res judicata of
                    the judgment should be limited solely to the parties. It follows that, at
                    least in theory, those States parties will not be prevented from exercising
                    their right to institute separate proceedings for the same cause against the
                    same State before the Court. This is not a far‑fetched concern. In consid-
                    ering The Gambia’s standing, the Court states that the situation with
                    Bangladesh does not affect the right of all other States parties to assert
                    the common interest in compliance with the obligations erga omnes partes
                    under the Convention (Judgment, para. 113). In other words, according
                    to the Court, even if Bangladesh is regarded as a specially affected State,
                    whether it files a case or not does not affect the right of other States par-
                    ties to institute proceedings before the Court. This reasoning apparently
                    is not in line with the rules of State responsibility.

                      12. These concerns give rise to the issue of judicial propriety for the
                    Court to consider whether it is appropriate to exercise jurisdiction in
                    the present case. Ultimately, they boil down to the very question whether


                    the “dispute” over the alleged acts of Myanmar could be settled by the
                    Court as wished by The Gambia or the OIC.


                                     II. Article IX and the Issue of Standing

                       13. In the present case, largely due to the character of The Gambia’s
                    legal action, the question of jurisdiction ratione personae and the issue of
                    standing are delicately interlinked. Whether Article IX of the Convention
                    provides jurisdiction ratione personae to a non-­injured State party also
                    bears on the standing of the Applicant.

                       14. In determining whether it has jurisdiction ratione personae in the
                     case with regard to the Respondent’s first preliminary objection, the
                     Court only examines whether The Gambia meets the conditions laid
                     down in Articles 34 and 35 of the Statute, without examining the terms of
                     the compromissory clause of the Genocide Convention, which is consid-
                    ered only in relation to the question of standing under Myanmar’s second
                    preliminary objection. Articles 34 and 35, however, basically concern the
                    right or “the legal capacity” of a party to appear before the Court, which
                    is a question of statutory requirements for access to the Court, not a
                    ­matter of consent for jurisdiction (Legality of Use of Force (Serbia and
                     Montenegro v. Belgium), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                     2004 (I), p. 295, para. 36). As is pointed out above, the issue before the
                     Court is not about The Gambia’s legal capacity to institute the proceed-
                     ings, but whether the Court has jurisdiction ratione personae to entertain
                     the case instituted by a non-­injured State. The matter relates, first and
                     foremost, to the interpretation of Article IX of the Genocide Convention,
                     namely whether the States parties have agreed to grant a general standing
                     to all the States parties for the invocation of responsibility of any other
                     State party solely on the basis of their common interest in compliance
                     with the obligations under the Convention.

                        15. Article IX of the Genocide Convention reads as follows:
                             “Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpre-
                          tation, application or fulfilment of the present Convention, including
                          those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or for any
                          of the other acts enumerated in article III, shall be submitted to the
                          International Court of Justice at the request of any of the parties to
                          the dispute.”
                       16. The wording of Article IX, per se, does not indicate much about
                    what exactly was intended by the contracting parties. In response to
                    Myanmar’s argument that The Gambia, as a non-­injured State, has no
                    standing in the case, the Court states the following:
                            “[T]he terms of Article IX providing that disputes are to be sub-
                          mitted to the Court ‘at the request of any of the parties to the dispute’,





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 98                                                                                  3/09/23 09:53

                         as opposed to any of the Contracting Parties, do not limit the category
                         of Contracting Parties entitled to bring claims for alleged breaches of
                         obligations erga omnes partes under the Convention. This phrase clar-
                         ifies that only a party to the dispute may bring it before the Court,
                         but it does not indicate that such a dispute may only arise between a
                         State party allegedly violating the Convention and a State ‘specially
                         affected’ by such an alleged violation.” (Judgment, para. 111.)

                    This interpretation, in my opinion, has unduly expanded the scope of Arti-
                    cle IX. Although the international law on State responsibility has evolved
                    significantly since the adoption of the Genocide Convention, the terms of
                    the Genocide Convention must be interpreted in accordance with the
                    applicable rules on treaty interpretation as reflected in Articles 31 and 32
                    of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. As the Court stated in
                    its Advisory Opinion on Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention
                    and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (hereinafter the “Advisory Opin-
                    ion”), in interpreting the Genocide Convention, regard should be given to
                    “[t]he origins and character of th[e] Convention, the objects pursued by the
                    General Assembly and the contracting parties, the relations which exist
                    between the provisions of the Convention, inter se, and between those pro-
                    visions and these objects” (I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23).
                       17. The Genocide Convention provides several means and mechanisms
                    for the implementation of the obligations under the Convention; judicial
                    settlement is just one of them. Most importantly, the States parties must
                    enact national legislation to prevent and punish acts of genocide and any
                    other acts enumerated in Article III (Article V of the Convention). Perpe-
                    trators may be tried in national courts or by a competent international
                    criminal court (Art. VI). The States parties also undertake to co-­operate
                    through extradition to bring the alleged offenders to justice (Art. VII). In
                    addition, any State party, whether it is directly or indirectly affected by
                    the alleged acts of genocide, may engage the competent organs of the
                    United Nations to take such action under the Charter as they consider
                    appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide
                    (Art. VIII). Lastly, a dispute between States parties with regard to the
                    interpretation, application or fulfilment of the Convention, including the
                    responsibility of a State for acts of genocide, may be submitted to the
                    Court at the request of any of the parties to the dispute (Art. IX). This set
                    of mechanisms takes into account the situation where a non-­injured State
                    party may raise the issue of genocide against another State party, but the
                    mechanisms to which such State party may resort apparently do not
                    include the International Court of Justice. This interpretation can be con-
                    firmed by the travaux préparatoires of the Genocide Convention.

                       18. The treaty was drafted at a time when the notions of obligations
                    erga omnes partes or erga omnes were not established in general interna-
                    tional law. During the negotiation process of Article IX, Contracting Par-


                    ties did not have much discussion on the word “disputes”; its ordinary
                    meaning was presumed to refer to bilateral disputes. The debate among
                    the Contracting Parties primarily focused on the meaning and scope of the
                    phrase “responsibility of a State for genocide” and whether to include it
                    in the clause. A number of Contracting Parties expressed doubt and raised
                    questions about the inclusion of State responsibility in so far as that
                    would cover situations in which a State commits genocide against its own
                    nationals (see e.g. United Nations General Assembly, Sixth Committee,
                    Hundred and Third Meeting, 12 November 1948, UN doc. A/C.6/SR.103,
                    pp. 432‑433 (Greece), 434 (Peru) and 435 (Poland); ibid., Hundred and
                    Fourth Meeting, 13 November 1948, UN doc. A/C.6/SR.104, p. 443
                    (Iran)). Upon the understanding that the term “responsibility of a State
                    for genocide” in Article IX refers to reparation for damages inflicted on
                    the nationals of one State party by another State party, they agreed to
                    retain that reference in Article IX. In clarifying the scope of State respon-
                    sibility, the United States stated that

                         “[i]f the words ‘responsibility of a State’ were taken in their traditional
                         meaning of responsibility towards another State for damages inflicted,
                         in violation of the principles of international law, to the subjects of
                         the plaintiff State ; and if, similarly, the words ‘disputes . . . relating
                         to the . . . fulfilment’ referred to disputes concerning the interests of
                         subjects of the plaintiff State, then those words would give rise to no
                         objection. But if, on the other hand, the expression ‘responsibility of
                         a State’ were not used in the traditional meaning, and if it signified
                         that a State could be sued for damages in respect of injury inflicted
                         by it on its own subjects, then there would be serious objections to
                         that provision ; and the United States Government would have reser-
                         vations to make about that interpretation of the phrase.” (Ibid., Hun-
                         dred and Thirty-Third Meeting, 2 December 1948, UN doc. A/C.6/
                         SR.133, pp. 703‑704 (United States of America).)
                    The United States’ position was generally shared and accepted by the Con­
                    tracting Parties.
                       19. The intention of the Contracting Parties to limit the scope of claims
                    that can be brought to the Court under Article IX is also manifested in
                    the general debate relating to the Belgian/British joint proposal on the
                    compromissory clause of the Genocide Convention. This joint proposal
                    stated as follows:
                            “Any dispute between the High Contracting Parties relating to the
                         interpretation, application or fulfilment of the present Convention,
                         including disputes relating to the responsibility of a State for any of
                         the acts enumerated in articles II and IV, shall be submitted to the
                         International Court of Justice at the request of any of the High Con-
                         tracting Parties.” (Belgium and United Kingdom : Joint amendment
                         to article X of the draft Convention (E/794), 10 November 1948,

                      20. India introduced an amendment to the Belgian/British joint pro-
                    posal to replace the phrase “at the request of any of the High Contracting
                    Parties” by the phrase “at the request of any of the parties to the dispute”
                    (UN doc. A/C.6/260, as reproduced in United Nations General Assem-
                    bly, Sixth Committee, Hundred and Third Meeting, 12 November 1948,
                    UN doc. A/C.6/SR.103, p. 428, fn. 1). In its consideration of the Belgian/
                    British proposal, India stated that
                         “the inclusion of all disputes relating to the responsibility of a State
                         for any of the acts enumerated in articles II and IV would certainly
                         give rise to serious difficulties. It would make it possible for an
                         unfriendly State to charge, on vague and unsubstantial allegations,
                         that another State was responsible for genocide within its territory.”
                         (Ibid., pp. 437‑438.)

                    Immediately after India expressed this concern, Luxembourg clarified
                    who might claim rights to reparations following the perpetration of the
                    crime of genocide. It stated that
                         “the principle that no action could be instituted save by a party con-
                         cerned in a case should be applied in that connexion. [R]esponsibility
                         would thus arise whenever genocide was committed by a State in the
                         territory of another State.” (Ibid., p. 438.)
                    The Indian amendment was approved in the general debate and the text
                    of Article IX was amended accordingly.
                       21. During the subsequent negotiations, India continued to express its
                    concern over the terms of Article IX. After the adoption of Article IX, it
                    warned that “the provisions of the joint amendment of Belgium and the
                    United Kingdom . . . were capable of being interpreted in a much wider
                    sense than the authors of the amendment had themselves intended” (ibid.,
                    Hundred and Fifth Meeting, 13 November 1948, UN doc. A/C.6/SR.105,
                    p. 459). After the vote against reconsideration of the text of Article IX,
                    India reiterated its position, stating that “the text of article IX would help
                    to strain relations between States and was therefore contrary to the very
                    purpose of the convention” (ibid., Hundred and Thirty-First Meeting,
                    1 December 1948, UN doc. A/C.6/SR.131, p. 690). India, of course, was
                    not the only Contracting Party who indicated its reservation over a pos-
                    sible expansive interpretation of Article IX.
                       22. The travaux préparatoires demonstrate that the Contracting Parties
                    were fully conscious of the potential problems of vague, insubstantial and
                    even abusive actions relating to the fulfilment of obligations and respon-
                    sibility for genocide. Such situations would more likely arise if an unlim-
                    ited standing was granted to the States parties. There was no indication
                    among the Contracting Parties that, given the raison d’être of the Geno-
                    cide Convention, the principle that no action could be instituted save by
                    a party concerned in a case would not apply to cases that are filed under
                    Article IX.





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 104                                                                               3/09/23 09:53

                       23. I agree with the Court that The Gambia is not exercising diplo-
                    matic protection in the present case, but that does not mean there need
                    not be a link between the applicant and the alleged acts of the respondent.
                    Although the word “[d]isputes” in Article IX is without any qualification,
                    opposition of views between the two parties must relate to a legal interest
                    that the applicant may claim for itself under international law. Unless
                    otherwise expressly provided for in a treaty, general standing of the States
                    parties cannot be presumed. In this regard, a provision in contrast can be
                    given. Article 33 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides
                    that “[a]ny High Contracting Party may refer to the [European Court of
                    Human Rights] any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention
                    and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party”. If the
                    Genocide Convention had contained a similar clause, the requirement of
                    a link between the applicant and the respondent’s alleged acts for jurisdic-
                    tional purpose would be unnecessary.


                       24. In cases concerning alleged violations of the Genocide Convention,
                    the Court has affirmed that Article IX includes all forms of State respon-
                    sibility, including the responsibility of a State for an act of genocide per-
                    petrated by the State itself through the acts of its organs (see e.g.
                    Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
                    Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary
                    Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 616, para. 32; see also
                    the divergent views in ibid., joint declaration of Judges Shi and Veresh-
                    chetin, pp. 631‑632, and declaration of Judge Oda, pp. 626‑629,
                    paras. 4-7), which reflects the development of international law on State
                    responsibility. In none of those cases, however, did the Court consider or
                    even imply that a State party may invoke international responsibility of
                    another State party solely on the basis of the raison d’être of the Geno-
                    cide Convention; the applicant must have a territorial, national or some
                    other form of connection with the alleged acts.

                       25. To recall what the Court said in the Advisory Opinion, “[i]t is well
                    established that in its treaty relations a State cannot be bound without its
                    consent” (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
                    ment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951,
                    p. 21). It is doubtful that, either at the time when they each became party
                    to the Genocide Convention, the Parties had ever envisaged such treaty
                    relationship between them or more generally, that the States parties ever
                    intended to give such a broad standing to the States parties for addressing
                    alleged breaches of the obligations under the Genocide Convention. The
                    Court’s innovative interpretation has extended well beyond the reason-
                    able expectations of the States parties, inconducive to the security and
                    stability of treaty relations.

                                III. Raison d’être of the Genocide Convention
                                              and Its Implication

                       26. By reference to the raison d’être of the Genocide Convention as
                    enunciated in the Advisory Opinion, the Court upholds The Gambia’s
                    standing for the following reasons :
                            “All the States parties to the Genocide Convention . . . have a
                         common interest to ensure the prevention, suppression and punish-
                         ment of genocide, by committing themselves to fulfilling the obliga-
                         tions contained in the Convention. As the Court has affirmed, such a
                         common interest implies that the obligations in question are owed by
                         any State party to all the other States parties to the relevant conven-
                         tion ; they are obligations erga omnes partes, in the sense that each
                         State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case.”
                         (Judgment, para. 107.)
                    It goes on to say that
                         “[t]he common interest in compliance with the relevant obligations
                         under the Genocide Convention entails that any State party, without
                         distinction, is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State
                         party for an alleged breach of obligations erga omnes partes . . .
                         regardless of whether a special interest can be demonstrated” (ibid.,
                         para. 108).
                    It explains that “[i]f a special interest were required for that purpose, in
                    many situations no State would be in a position to make a claim” (ibid.).
                    This reasoning, based on a particular reading of the Advisory Opinion,
                    does not seem consistent with the established practice of the States par-
                    ties.
                       27. In the Advisory Opinion, the Court was requested by the General
                    Assembly to address exclusively the question of reservations to the Geno-
                    cide Convention. For that purpose, it considered the characteristics of the
                    Genocide Convention in international law and identified the common
                    interest of the States parties in the accomplishment of the high purposes
                    of the Convention. In the oft cited statement in the Advisory Opinion on
                    which the Court largely relies for its decision in the present case, the
                    Court stated that
                         “[t]he Convention was manifestly adopted for a purely humanitarian
                         and civilizing purpose. It is indeed difficult to imagine a convention
                         that might have this dual character to a greater degree . . . In such a
                         convention the contracting States do not have any interests of their
                         own ; they merely have, one and all, a common interest, namely, the
                         accomplishment of those high purposes which are the raison d’être of
                         the convention. Consequently, in a convention of this type one cannot

                         duties. The high ideals which inspired the Convention provide, by
                         virtue of the common will of the parties, the foundation and measure
                         of all its provisions.” (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention
                         and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.
                         Reports 1951, p. 23.)
                    Notwithstanding the common interest thus identified, the Court did not
                    consider that reservations to the Genocide Convention should be categor-
                    ically prohibited. Instead, it took the view that the compatibility of a res-
                    ervation with the object and purpose of the Convention should furnish a
                    criterion for assessing a particular reservation made by a State on acces-
                    sion and appraising an objection lodged by another State to the reserva-
                    tion, thus limiting both the freedom of making reservations and that of
                    objecting to them. The Court observed that, as the intention of the Gen-
                    eral Assembly and the States parties was to have as many States as pos-
                    sible participate in the Convention so as to ensure the widest possible
                    scope of application, the complete exclusion of States from the Conven-
                    tion for minor reservations would not be deemed desirable for the fulfil-
                    ment of the object and purpose of the Convention. In the Advisory
                    Opinion, the Court did not specify which reservations to the provisions of
                    the Convention would be deemed as minor reservations and therefore
                    permissible, and which are incompatible with the object and purpose of
                    the Convention. Pursuant to that criterion, in the subsequent treaty prac-
                    tice, a reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention has generally
                    been accepted as permissible by the States parties. To date, 16 States par-
                    ties maintain reservations to Article IX.
                       28. This position has also been confirmed by the jurisprudence of the
                    Court. According to the Court, a reservation to Article IX of the Geno-
                    cide Convention bears on the jurisdiction of the Court, which is meant to
                    exclude a particular method of settling a dispute relating to the interpre-
                    tation, application or fulfilment of the Convention, and does not affect
                    substantive obligations relating to acts of genocide themselves under that
                    Convention. Therefore, a reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Con-
                    vention is not incompatible with the object and purpose of the Conven-
                    tion (Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application:
                    2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and

                    paras. 24‑25).
                       29. Reservation to a compromissory clause and standing of a non-­
                    injured State, although distinct and separate issues, both concern whether
                    the Court can exercise its jurisdiction. A reservation to Article IX has the
                    effect of blocking other States parties from instituting proceedings against
                    the reserving State for its alleged breaches of obligations erga omnes par-





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 110                                                                               3/09/23 09:53

                    tes under the Convention. This means that reservations to Article IX of
                    the Genocide Convention could also lead to many situations where no
                    State party would be in a position to make a claim before the Court
                    against another State party who has made a reservation to the jurisdic-
                    tion of the Court, as was the case, for instance, with Rwanda in the
                    Armed Activities case, and Spain and the United States in the Legality of
                    Use of Force cases. No State party has ever asserted that the Court’s deci-
                    sions upholding the effect of the relevant reservations in those cases preju-
                    diced the common interest of the States parties to the Convention.
                    Logically, the reason given by the Court in the present case for discarding
                    the requirement of a special interest cannot be established; just as, in the
                    situation of a reservation to the jurisdiction of the Court, dismissal of an
                    application for lack of standing of a non‑injured State is, in the Court’s
                    own words, also just to exclude a particular method of settling a dispute
                    relating to the interpretation, application or fulfilment of the Convention,
                    and does not affect substantive obligations relating to acts of genocide
                    themselves under that Convention.




                           IV. Obligations Erga omnes partes and the Belgium
                                             v. Senegal Case

                       30. Introduction of the notion of obligations erga omnes and erga
                    omnes partes is a positive development of international law. In the second
                    phase of the South West Africa cases, the Court rejected the applications
                    submitted by Ethiopia and Liberia, former members of the League of
                    Nations, on the ground that they had no standing in the cases as they
                    each did not have any legal right or interest in the subject-­matter of their
                    claim (South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa ; Liberia v. South
                    Africa), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1966, p. 51, para. 99).
                    The Court’s decision was severely criticized by the Member States of the
                    United Nations and prompted the General Assembly to adopt the ­decision
                    placing South West Africa under the direct responsibility of the United
                    Nations.
                       31. The South West Africa cases stand as a constant reminder that in
                    cases where the common interest of the international community is pur-
                    portedly at stake, the issue of standing of the applicant must be handled
                    with great care. For the purpose of the present case, it is worthwhile to
                    put the South West Africa cases into perspective. After the dissolution of
                    the League of Nations, the mandate for South West Africa entrusted to
                    the Union of South Africa by the League continued to exist. By virtue of
                    the Court’s Advisory Opinion relating to the international status of South
                    West Africa, the Union of South Africa as the mandatory remained
                    obliged to submit petitions from the inhabitants of the mandated terri-
                    tory as well as annual reports concerning its administration of the terri-





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 112                                                                              3/09/23 09:53

                    tory to the United Nations for the latter’s exercise of its supervisory
                    functions (International Status of South West Africa, Advisory Opinion,
                    I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 143). The Union of South Africa, however,
                    adopted apartheid in the territory and refused to fulfil its obligations
                    under the mandate. In 1960, Ethiopia and Liberia instituted proceedings
                    against the Union of South Africa in the Court.

                      32. In his dissenting opinion appended to the Court’s Judgment in the
                    second phase, Judge Wellington Koo, then Vice-­President, described the
                    character of the mandate for South West Africa as follows:
                            “[T]he mandates system has a complex character all of its own, with
                         a set of general and particular obligations for the mandatory to
                         observe or carry out, and with a scheme of multiple control and super-
                         vision by the League of Nations with its Council, Assembly, member
                         States and the Permanent Mandates Commission and with judicial
                         protection in the last resort by the Permanent Court. It is a novel
                         international institution. Nothing of the kind had existed before. It is
                         sui generis.” (South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa ; Lib­
                         eria v. South Africa), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1966,
                         dissenting opinion of Vice-­President Wellington Koo, p. 217.)


                    This sui generis system, in Judge Koo’s words, constituted an interna-
                    tional joint enterprise. Among the guarantees provided therefore to
                    ensure its success, an adjudication clause was inserted into Article 7,
                    paragraph 2, of the Mandate for South West Africa, which reads as fol-
                    lows :
                            “The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should arise
                         between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of
                         Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the provi-
                         sions of the Mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negoti-
                         ation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International
                         Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of
                         Nations.” (Ibid., p. 218.)
                    With regard to the Court’s view that the applicants as individual member
                    States had no legal right or interest in the case, Judge Koo referred to
                    Article 22 of the Covenant and the mandate agreement, by virtue of
                    which, in his view, member States of the League had the legal right and
                    interest in the observation by the mandatory of its obligations both
                    toward the inhabitants of the mandated territory, and toward the League
                    and its members. The adjudication clause was intended as the last resort
                    to enable the member States to seek judicial protection of such right and
                    interest. Obviously, standing of the member States before the Court was
                    based on the statutory provisions of the mandate rather than merely on a
                    common interest ; it was granted in advance to the individual member





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 114                                                                              3/09/23 09:53

                    States of the League, and subsequently the member States of the
                    United Nations, on the basis of the consent of the member States (South
                    West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa ; Liberia v. South Africa), Prelimi-
                    nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 343). This unique sys-
                    tem cannot be generalized to all other conventions, where a common
                    interest of the States parties may exist.


                       33. Largely as a rectification of its position taken in the South West
                    Africa cases, the Court in the Barcelona Traction case made its first pro-
                    nouncement on the concept of obligation erga omnes, recognizing the
                    common interest of the international community as a whole in the protec-
                    tion of certain important rights. It stated that

                         “an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of
                         a State towards the international community as a whole, and those
                         arising ­vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By
                         their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of
                         the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have
                         a legal interest in their protection ; they are obligations erga omnes.”
                         (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (New Appli-
                         cation: 1962) (Belgium v. Spain), Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J.
                         Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33.)

                    The Court, however, stopped short of indicating whether such obliga-
                    tions, either on the basis of treaty provisions or customary international
                    law, would by themselves provide standing for any State to institute pro-
                    ceedings against any other State before the Court for the protection of the
                    common interest.
                       34. Since Barcelona Traction, the Court has referred to obligations
                    erga omnes in a number of other cases, in none of which, however, it dealt
                    with the relationship between such obligations and the question of stand-
                    ing (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995,

                    and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro case, with regard to the appli-
                    cant’s request that the Court make rulings about acts of genocide and





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 116                                                                                3/09/23 09:53

                    other unlawful acts allegedly committed against “non-Serbs” outside its
                    own territory by the respondent, the Court recognized that this request
                    could concern questions about the legal interest or standing of the appli-
                    cant in respect of such matters and the significance of the jus cogens charac­
                    ter of the relevant norms. Before turning to those questions, however, the
                    Court found that the evidence offered by the applicant did not in any way
                    support its allegations and, therefore, it did not see the need to address
                    those questions of law (Application of the Convention on the Prevention
                    and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Ser-

                    para. 185).
                       35. The only case in which the Court explicitly affirms the entitlement
                    of a State party to make a claim against another State party on the basis
                    of the common interest in compliance with the obligations erga omnes
                    partes is the Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite
                    (Belgium v. Senegal) case. On the issue of standing, I will not repeat my dis-
                    senting opinion appended to that Judgment but highlight three points.

                       36. First, the issue raised by the applicant in Belgium v. Senegal essen-
                    tially concerns the interpretation and application of the principle of extra-
                    dition or prosecution, aut dedere aut judicare, under Article 7, paragraph 1,
                    of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrad-
                    ing Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter the “Convention against Tor-
                    ture”), with Article 5 establishing universal jurisdiction over criminal
                    offences of torture as defined in that convention. As its national courts
                    were seised of cases against Mr. Hissène Habré, the former President of
                    Chad, for alleged torture offences, Belgium was a specially affected State
                    in the case. By virtue of its national law and Article 8 of the Convention
                    against Torture, Belgium had the right to make a request to Senegal for
                    the extradition of the alleged offender. According to Article 7, para-
                    graph 1, if a State party in whose territory the alleged offender is found
                    decides not to extradite the person concerned, it is obliged to submit the
                    case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Belgium
                    claimed that the respondent, having failed to prosecute Mr. Habré and
                    refused to extradite him to Belgium, had breached its obligation under
                    Article 7, paragraph 1, of that convention. Logically, whether S      ­ enegal
                    had fulfilled its obligation under Article 6, paragraph 2, to conduct
                    ­preliminary inquiry into the facts of the alleged offences constituted part
                     of the legal issues relating to the principle of extradition or prosecution.



                       37. In any event, the Court’s pronouncement on the obligations erga
                    omnes partes cannot be taken as a legal basis for Belgium’s standing in the
                    case before the Court. The issue that involves Belgium’s standing relates to
                    the question whether Belgium remained competent to request the extradi-
                    tion of the alleged offender as a result of the amendments to its national





6 CIJ1258_Ord.indb 118                                                                               3/09/23 09:53

                    laws. In 1993, Belgium enacted a national law establishing universal juris-
                    diction for its national courts in respect of war crimes (Law on the repres-
                    sion of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and
                    protocols I and II of 8 June 1977 (loi relative à la répression des infractions
                    graves aux conventions internationales de Genève du 12 août 1949 et aux pro-
                    tocoles I et II du 8 juin 1977), 16 June 1993, Art. 7). In 1999, the scope of
                    punishable offences subject to universal jurisdiction under the 1993 act was
                    expanded to include genocide and crimes against humanity, including tor-
                    ture (Act concerning the punishment of grave breaches of international
                    humanitarian law (loi relative à la répression des violations graves du droit
                    international humanitaire), 10 February 1999, Art. 1 (1)‑(2)). In April 2003,
                    a further amendment was made to the law, requiring a request from the
                    Federal Prosecutor for the criminal investigation of a complaint on the
                    basis of universal jurisdiction (Law amending the law of 16 June 1993 con-
                    cerning the prohibition of grave breaches of international humanitarian
                    law and article 144ter of the judicial code (loi modifiant la loi du 16 juin
                    1993 relative à la répression des violations graves du droit international
                    humanitaire et l’article 144ter du code judiciaire), 23 April 2003, Art. 5). The
                    1993 act as thus amended was repealed by an act of 5 August 2003, which
                    also amended the Code of Criminal Procedure. Among the changes intro-
                    duced therein, the new act provides that there must exist some requisite link
                    with Belgium for prosecution of the alleged offences previously proscribed
                    by the 1993 act (Law on grave breaches of international humanitarian law
                    (loi relative aux violations graves du droit international humanitaire),
                    5 August 2003, Art. 16 (1)-(2)). All of the above changes to Belgium’s crim-
                    inal law and procedure preceded Belgium’s application instituting proceed-
                    ings before the Court in the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite case.
                    Although Belgium’s criminal investigations against Mr. Hissène Habré
                    could be traced back to 2000 and were being conducted pursuant to the
                    1993 act as amended in 1999, it was only in 2005 that a Belgian investigat-
                    ing judge issued an international warrant in absentia for Mr. Habré’s arrest
                    and that Belgium subsequently requested his extradition. During the pro-
                    ceedings before the Court, Belgium claimed that the act of 5 August 2003
                    “imposes no bar to such universal jurisdiction, because the 2003 Law pro-
                    vides that investigations [that] begun before its entry into force may be pur-
                    sued if they follow from complaints filed by Belgians” (Questions relating to
                    the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Memorial of
                    the Kingdom of Belgium, 1 July 2010, Vol. I, p. 20). Apparently, the issue
                    for the Court to decide was whether Belgium was competent in accordance
                    with Article 5 of the Convention against Torture to maintain its request for
                    extradition of Mr. Habré in light of the changes to its national law. The
                    matter concerns the conditions for extradition rather than the obligation to
                    prosecute. The Court’s reasoning that “[i]f a special interest were required
                    for that purpose, in many cases no State would be in the position to make
                    such a claim”, a purported ground for Belgium’s standing in the case, does
                    not, in my view, fit into the situation where the principle of extradition or
                    prosecution is applicable.

                       38. Secondly, the Court has consistently maintained a clear distinction
                    between substantive norms and procedural rules. It has firmly held that
                    “the erga omnes character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdic-
                    tion are two different things” (East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judg-
                    ment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). This position is reiterated in
                    Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
                    Crime of Genocide ((Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro),
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), p. 104, para. 147) (see also Jurisdic-
                    tional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening),
                    Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I), p. 140, para. 93). The inference drawn
                    from the common interest in the Belgium v. Senegal case and the present
                    case confuses the legal interest of the States parties in the compliance with
                    the substantive obligations of the Genocide Convention and the proce-
                    dure for dispute settlement.
                       39. Thirdly, the common interest enunciated by the Court in the Advi-
                    sory Opinion exists not solely in the Genocide Convention. As the Court
                    found in the Belgium v. Senegal case, the States parties to the Convention
                    against Torture also have a common interest in compliance with the rel-
                    evant obligations under that convention, which are characterized as obli-
                    gations erga omnes partes. By analogy, such common interest could
                    equally be identified in many other conventions relating to, for example,
                    human rights, disarmament and environment. If obligations under those
                    conventions are therefore regarded as obligations erga omnes partes, by
                    virtue of the Court’s reasoning in the present case, it means that any of
                    the States parties, specially affected or not by an alleged breach of the
                    relevant obligations, would have standing to institute proceedings in the
                    Court against the alleged State party, provided no reservation to the
                    jurisdiction of the Court is entered by either of the parties. This approach
                    has two potential consequences: one is that more States would make res-
                    ervations to the jurisdiction of the Court and the second is that India’s
                    concern expressed during the negotiation process on Article IX of the
                    Genocide Convention over vague and insubstantial allegations may be
                    raised again.



                       40. The situation of the Rohingyas in Myanmar deserves serious
                    responses from the international community. If there is evidence suggest-
                    ing that there may be commission of genocidal acts in Myanmar, various
                    organs of the United Nations possess powers which can be exercised for
                    the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide pursuant to the initia-
                    tive of one or more United Nations Member States, even without the
                    exercise of the right under Article VIII of the Genocide Convention. The
                    fact is that the situation of Myanmar and the Rohingya refugees has been
                    on the agenda of various United Nations organs for years. The human
                    rights situation of the Rohingyas has also been under the investigation of
                    a UN Fact-­Finding Mission and the Special Rapporteur for Myanmar.

                    Above all, Myanmar remains bound by its obligations under the Geno-
                    cide Convention.

                       41. The situation in Myanmar, as is found in the 2017 Final Report of
                    the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, represents a development
                    crisis, a human rights crisis and a security crisis; while all communities
                    have suffered from violence and abuse, protracted statelessness and pro-
                    found discrimination have made the Muslim community particularly vul-
                    nerable to human rights violations. As Kofi Annan, Chair of the
                    Advisory Commission, pointed out, “the challenges facing Rakhine State
                    and its peoples are complex and the search for lasting solutions will
                    require determination, perseverance and trust” (Statement by Kofi
                    Annan, Chair of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State (Interim
                    Report), 16 March 2017).
