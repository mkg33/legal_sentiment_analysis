The Court has dealt with one single question, namely: Have the Appli-
cants a legal interest in the subject-matter of the claim? Upon this the
Court has found—

“that the Applicants cannot be considered to have established any
legal right or interest appertaining to them in the subject-matter
of the present claims: and that, accordingly, the Court must decline
to give effect to them. For these reasons, the Court decides to reject
the claims of the Empire of Ethiopia and the Republic of Liberia.”

The Court, in my view, has been able to do that from an unwarranted
assumption of the presumed intentions of the framers of the Covenant
and the mandates system in 1919, and from an analysis and infer-
pretation of such instruments consequent with the particular assumption,
which serves as basis or premise of the Court’s analysis and reasoning.
This process, has accordingly led the Court to its present decision.

The Court answered that question in due application of paragraph 2
of Article 55. In consequence, the Court’s present decision states the
reasons and arguments, in view of which, it finds that the Applicants
do not have a substantive right or legal interest in the claim.

The majority of the Court is reproducing on the present occasion the
arguments adduced in dissenting opinions against the Judgment of 1962.

In my view the Court has been able to arrive at its conclusion by
assuming, beforehand, the correctness of its interpretation of Article 7 (2)
of the Mandate for German South West Africa, which is the main basis
of its reasoning.

On page 328, the Court then said:

“To found the jurisdiction of the Court in the proceedings, the
Applicants, having regard to Article 80, paragraph 1, of the Charter
of the United Nations, relied on Article 7 of the Mandate of 17 De-
cember 1920 for South West Africa, and Article 37 of the Statute
of the Court. In response to the Applications and Memorials of
Ethiopia and Liberia, the Government of South Africa filed Pre-
liminary Objections to the jurisdiction of the Court.”

Such Preliminary Objections read as follows (ibid., p. 326):

“On behalf of the Government of South Africa, in the Preliminary
Objections:

‘For all or any of the reasons set out in these Preliminary Ob-
jections, the Government of the Republic of South Africa submits
that the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia have no locus standi
in these contentious proceedings and that the Honourable Court
has no jurisdiction to hear, or adjudicate upon, the questions of
law and fact raised in the Applications and Memorials; and prays
that the Court may adjudge and determine accordingly.’

On behalf of the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia, in the written
Observations on the Preliminary Objections:

‘May it please this Honourable Court to dismiss the Preliminary
Objections raised by the Government of the Republic of South
Africa in the South West Africa cases, and to adjudge and declare
that the Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the questions
of law and fact raised in the Applications and Memorials of the
Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia in these cases.” ”

In the oral proceedings the following submissions were presented by
the Parties:

“On behalf of the Government of South Africa, at the hearing on
11 October 1962:



‘For all or any one or more of the reasons set out in its written
and oral statements, the Government of the Republic of South.
Africa submits that the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia have
no locus standi in these contentious proceedings, and that the Court
has no jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon the questions of law
and fact raised in the Applications and Memorials, more particularly
because:

Firstly, by reason of the dissolution of the League of Nations,
the Mandate for South West Africa is no longer a “treaty or conven-
tion in force” within the meaning of Article 37 of the Statute of
the Court, this submission being advanced—

(a) with respect to the said Mandate Agreement as a whole,
including Article 7 thereof, and

(b) in any event, with respect to Article 7 itself;

Secondly, neither the Government of Ethiopia nor the Government
of Liberia is “another Member of the League of Nations”, as required
for locus standi by Article 7 of the Mandate for South West Africa;

Thirdly, the conflict or disagreement alleged by the Governments of
Ethiopia and Liberia to exist between them and the Government of
the Republic of South Africa, is by reason of its nature and content
not a “dispute” as envisaged in Article 7 of the Mandate for South
West Africa, more particularly in that no material interests of the Go-
vernments of Ethiopia and/or Liberia or of their nationals are in-
volved therein or affected thereby;

Fourthly, the alleged conflict or disagreement is as regards its state of
development not a “dispute” which “cannot be settled by negotiation”
within the meaning of Article 7 of the Mandate for South West Africa.’

On behalf of the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia, at the hearing
on 17 October 1962:

‘May it please the Court to dismiss the Preliminary Objections
raised by the Government of the Republic of South Africa in the
South West Africa cases, and to adjudge and declare that the Court
has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the questions of law and
fact raised in the Applications and Memorials of the Governments
of Ethiopia and Liberia in these cases.” ”

Questions having been put to the Parties by two Judges, the Court
decided that the answers to them should be given after the oral rejoinder,
first on behalf of the Republic of South Africa and then on behalf of
Ethiopia and Liberia; and that, in the same order, the Agents should be
called upon to indicate whether those questions and the answers given
to them had led them to amend their respective submissions and, if so,
to present the amended submissions.

Availing themselves of this decision, the Agents of the Parties gave
their answers on 22 October 1962. The Agent of the Republic of South



Africa amended the submissions which he had read at the hearing on
11 October by substituting the following paragraph for the paragraph
commencing with the word “Firstly”:
“Firstly, the Mandate for South West Africa has never been, or
at any rate is since the dissolution of the League of Nations no longer,
a ‘treaty or convention in force’ within the meaning of Article 37 of
the Statute of the Court, this Submission being advanced—
(a) with respect to the Mandate as a whole, including Article 7
thereof; and
(b) in any event, with respect to Article 7 itself.”

After due consideration of the issues involved, the Court in its 1962


(1) the Applicants have locus standi;

(2) the Applicants were Members of the League and could then and
can now invoke the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice
in accordance with Article 37 of the Statute;

(3) a dispute, as envisaged in Article 7 of the Mandate, does exist
between the Parties;
(4) the dispute cannot be settled by negotiation.

before the Court by the Applicants does not affect any material interest
of the Applicant States or their nationals, and their further contention
that the League Members have no legal right or interest in the observance
by the Mandatory of its duties to the inhabitants; the Court then said:

“The question which calls for the Court’s consideration is whether
the dispute is a ‘dispute’ as envisaged in Article 7 of the Mandate
and within the meaning of Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.

The Respondent’s contention runs counter to the natural and
ordinary meaning of the provisions of Article 7 of the Mandate, which
mentions ‘any dispute whatever’ arising between the Mandatory
and another Member of the League of Nations ‘relating to the
interpretation or the application of the provisions of the Mandate’.
The language used is broad, clear and precise: it gives rise to no ambi-
guity and it permits of no exception. It refers to any dispute whatever
relating not to any one particular provision or provisions, but to
‘the provisions’ of the Mandate, obviously meaning all or any provis-
ions, whether they relate to substantive obligations of the Mandatory
toward the inhabitants of the Territory or toward the other Members
of the League or to its obligation to submit to supervision by the
League under Article 6 or to protection under Article 7 itself. For
the manifest scope and purport of the provisions of this Article
indicate that the Members of the League were understood to have a
legal right or interest in the observance by the Mandatory of its
obligations both toward the inhabitants of the Mandated Territory,



and toward the League of Nations and its Members.” (South West
Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962,
p. 343.)

Those mentioned above were, among others, the main findings of
the Court in 1962. The considerations and reasons for its findings are
summarized in the following statements, contained in the Courts


(a) the Applicants do have locus standi;

(b) the Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the question of
law and fact, raised by the Applicants;

(¢) the Mandate is a “treaty or convention in force” within the meaning
of Article 37 of the Statute. It is an international agreement, having


(d) a dispute exists between the Parties before the Court, constituted by
their opposing attitude relating to the performance of the obligations
of the Mandate (ibid., p. 328);

(e) the Mandate is an international instrument of an institutional
character (ibid., p. 332);

(f) the authority which the Respondent exercises over South West
Africa is based on the Mandate. If the Mandate lapsed, so did the
Respondent’s authority. To retain rights and deny obligations, is
not justified (International Status of South West Africa, Advisory
Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950; South West Africa, Preliminary
Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 333);

(g) the obligation to submit to international supervision, is of the very
essence of the Mandate and cannot be excluded;


(h)


the Union of South Africa is under an obligation to accept the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, according to Article 37 of the
Statute and Article 80 (1) of the Charter (International Status of
South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950) ;


(J)

(k)

and continues to reflect the Court’s Opinion in 1962 (South West
Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1962,
p. 334);

the obligation to submit to compulsory jurisdiction was effectively
transferred to the International Court before the dissolution of the
League;

the Mandate as a whole, including of course Article 7, is still in
force (ibid., p. 335);

(1) judicial protection of the “sacred trust” was an essential feature

of the mandates system, the duty and right of insuring the perfor-
mance of this trust was given to the League, its organs and all its
Members;

(m) in the event of a veto by the Mandatory under the unanimity rule

(n)

(0)

(s)
(1)

(u)

(Articles 4 and 5, Covenant), the only course left to defend the inter-
ests of the inhabitants would be to obtain adjudication by the Court
(ibid., p. 337);

as neither the Council nor the League was entitled to appear before
the Court, the only effective recourse for protection of the sacred
trust would be for a Member or Members of the League to invoke
Article 7 and bring the dispute to the Permanent Court for adjudi-
cation. Article 7 played an essential part as one of the securities in
the mandates system (ibid, p. 337);

the right to implead the Mandatory before the Permanent Court,
was specially and expressly conferred on the Members of the
League because it was the most reliable procedure of ensuring
protection;

the clear and precise language of Article 7 refers to any dispute
relating to “the provisions”, meaning all or any provisions (ibid.,
p. 343);

the scope and purport of Article 7 indicate that the Members of the
League were understood to have a legal right or interest in the
observance of the Mandatory’s obligations towards the inhabitants
of the territory (ibid., p. 343);

article 7 is clearly in the nature of implementing one of the “se-
curities for the performance of this trust”, mentioned in Article
22 (D);

the present dispute is a dispute as envisaged in Article 7;
repeated negotiations over a period of more than ten years, in the
General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations had
reached a deadlock before 4 November 1960 and the impasse
continues to exist. No reasonable probability exists that further
negotiations would lead to a settlement;

diplomacy by conference or parliamentary diplomacy, has come


to be recognized as one of the established modes of international
negotiation, and in cases where the disputed questions are of common
interest to a group of States on one side or the other in an organized
body, it has often been found to be the most practical form of
negotiation. If the question at issue is one of mutual interest to
many States, there is no reason why each of them should go through
the formality and pretence of direct negotiation with the common
adversary State, after they have participated in the collective ne-
gotiation with the same State in opposition;

(v) the Court concludes that Article 7 is a treaty or convention still in
force and that the dispute cannot be settled by negotiation. Con-
sequently, the Court is competent to hear the dispute on the merits
(ibid., p. 347).

In the present proceedings, the Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the merits of the dispute (South West Africa, Preliminary Objections,
Judgment, T.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 347).

The merits of the dispute have been presented and developed before
the Court through the written and oral arguments of the Parties to the
present case.

Much time, effort and expense have been used in these pleadings, and
the Court is acquainted with all the necessary elements to form a con-
sidered opinion and to pass on the merits of the Applicants’ claim.

This, in my opinion, the Court should have done, and the majority
should not have limited and restricted the whole field of these contentious
proceedings on the merits to the narrow point of the question regarding
legal interest or substantive right.

The concepts expressed on the occasion of the 1950 Opinion are
fundamental for the consideration of the case in the present procedure.
The 1962 Judgment is based on this Opinion and the Court, in my view,
is bound to abide by the conclusions given in that Judgment in respect
to the legal interest of the Applicants and the admissibility of the
claim. Furthermore, the Court cannot ignore the conclusions arrived

1 After the 1950 Opinion had been accepted and approved by the General
Assembly it was the “law recognized by the United Nations”. (Judge Lauterpacht,
in Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa,
1.C.J. Reports 1956, p. 46.)



at in its Advisory Opinions of 1950 and 1956, taking into account that:

“In exercising its discretion [to give an Advisory Opinion] the
International Court of Justice, like the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice, has always been guided by the principle which the
Permanent Court stated in the case concerning the Status of Eastern
Carelia” (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17,
paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962,
p. 155),

to the effect that:

“The Court, being a Court of Justice cannot, even in giving
advisory opinions, depart from the essential rules guiding their
activity as a Court.” (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion,
1923, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 5, p. 29.) }

In order to omit quotations from the Court’s Opinions, while dealing
with particular issues, I will emphasize at the outset some of the points,
reasoning and conclusions of the Court in its 1950 Advisory Opinion
and in its 1962 Judgment, in which I find support for my own views.

*
* +

An international régime, the mandates system, was created by
Article 22 with a view to giving practical effect to the two principles of
(a) non-annexation, and (b) that the well-being and development of the
peoples inhabiting the mandated territories, not yet able to stand by
themselves, form ‘‘a sacred trust of civilization”.

The creation of this new international institution did not involve any
cession of territory or transfer of sovereignty, and the Union was to
exercise an international function of administration on behalf of the
League of Nations.

The Mandate was created in the interests of the inhabitants and of
humanity in general, as an international institution with an international
object—a sacred trust of civilization.

The international rules regulating the Mandate constituted an inter-
national status for the territory.

The functions were of international character and their exercise,
therefore, was subjected to the supervision of the Council of the

1 Hammarskjold, La juridiction internationale (Leyde, 1938), p. 289. He also
quoted from the report submitted by Judges Loder, Moore and Anzilotti, in 1927,
that the view that advisory opinions are not binding is more theoretical than real.
(Series E, No. 4, p. 76.) -

“In this connexion, it may be recalled that in using judicial decisions as a ‘source
of law’ by virtue of Article 38 (1) (d) of the Statute, no distinction at all is made

given in the form of an advisory opinion. Recourse is equally had to both types
of judicial decision.” (Rosenne, The International Court of Justice, 1957, p. 493,
note 2.)



League of Nations and to the obligation to submit annual reports.

Obligations: (a) administration as a “sacred trust”; (b) machinery
for implementation, supervision and control as “securities for the
performance of this trust”. These obligations represent the very essence
of the “sacred trust”. Their fulfilment could not be brought to an end,
nor the rights of the population with the liquidation of the League, as
they did not depend on the existence of the League.

The provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 80 of the Charter presuppose
that the rights of States and peoples shall not lapse automatically on the
dissolution of the League.

The resolution of the League’s Assembly of 18 April 1946 had to
recognize that the functions of the League terminated with its existence,
at the same time the Assembly recognized that Chapters XI, XII and
XIII of the Charter embodied the principles declared in Article 22 of
the Covenant of the League of Nations.

In paragraph 4 of that resolution, the Mandatory Powers recognized
that some time would lapse from the termination of the League to the
implementation of the trusteeship system, and assumed the obligation
to continue nevertheless, in the meantime, to administer the territories
under mandate, for the well-being of the peoples concerned, until other
arrangements have been agreed between them and the United Nations.

The Assembly understood that the mandates were to continue in
existence until “other arrangements” were established, concerning the
future status of the territory.

Maintaining the ‘status quo” meant: to administer the territory
as a sacred trust and to give account and report on the acts of ad-
ministration.

There are decisive reasons for an affirmative answer to the question
whether the supervisory functions of the League are to be exercised by
the new international organization created by this Charter.

The authors of the Covenant considered that the effective performance
of the sacred trust of civilization required that the administration
of the mandated territories should be subjected to international super-
vision.

The necessity for supervision continues to exist. It cannot be admitted
that the obligation to submit to supervision has disappeared, merely
because the supervisory organ under the mandates system has ceased to
exist, when the United Nations has another international organ per-
forming similar supervisory functions.

Article 80, paragraph 1, of the Charter, purports to safeguard the
rights of the peoples of mandated territories until trusteeship agreements
are concluded, but no such rights of the peoples could be effectively



safeguarded without international supervision and a duty to render
reports to a supervisory organ.

The resolution of 18 April 1946 of the Assembly of the League pre-
supposes that the supervisory functions exercised by the League would
be taken over by the United Nations, and the General Assembly has the
competence derived from the provisions of Article 10 of the Charter,
and is legally qualified to exercise such supervisory functions.

On 31 January 1923 the Council of the League adopted certain rules
by which the mandatory governments were to transmit petitions. This
right which the inhabitants of South West Africa has thus acquired is
maintained by Article 80, paragraph 1, of the Charter.

The dispatch and examination of petitions form a part of the super-
vision, and petitions are to be transmitted by the Union Government
to the General Assembly, which is legally qualified to deal with them.

The Court was of the opinion that Article 7 of the Mandate is still
in force and that having regard to Article 37 of the Statute of the inter-
national Court and Article 80 (1) of the Charter, the Union Government
is under an obligation to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.

The Union has no competence to modify unilaterally the international
status of the territory, as is shown by Article 7 of the Mandate. The
competence to determine and modify the international status of South
West Africa rests with the Government of South Africa acting with the
consent of the United Nations.

I will now express my views on the points involved in what I believe
to be the main issues:

(a) that the Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the merits in the
present case;

(b) that the claims are admissible;

(c) that the Mandate did not lapse, is in existence and still in operation ;

(d) that the decision of the 1962 Judgment, based on the 1950 and 1956
Advisory Opinions, is res judicata between the Parties, especially in
respect of jurisdiction and the survival of the Mandate, and that the
issue of the locus standi of the Applicants is also res judicata;

(e) that the Mandate is a “Treaty or Convention in force’ within the
meaning of Article 37 of the Statute;

(f) that the Court—regardless of the question whether it is legally
bound by its previous judgments—has no grounds nor weighty
reasons to reconsider nor reverse the 1962 decision or to ignore the
moral, political and juridical authority of the 1950 and 1956 Ad-
visory Opinions;

(g) that the Mandatory has the obligation to make annual reports



(h)

SOUTH WEST. AFRICA (Diss. OP. PADILLA NERVO)

(Article 6), and transmit petitions, and submit to internationa

supervision ;

that the General Assembly, after the dissolution of the League, is
the supervisory organ with the functions formerly performed by the
Council of the League, and this by virtue of the powers given to the
General Assembly by Article 10 of the Charter, and in compliance
with Article 80 and the spirit of Article 76, and the resolution of
18 April 1946 of the Assembly of the League;

(i) that Articles 6 and 7 of the Mandate are in full force and should be

complied with, as being susceptible of performance toward the
United Nations, which now represents the “organized International
Community” created and intended to substitute the League of
Nations;

(j) that the trusteeship system is the modern version of the mandates

system, established with the purpose of maintaining the principles
of it, and to transform every mandate into a trust territory or an
independent State.

APPLICANTS’ LEGAL INTEREST

The Respondent’s contention that according to the wording in Ar-
ticle 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate, the Applicants have not “locus standi”,
because since the dissolution of the League there could no longer be
“another Member of the League of Nations” today, was a contention
rejected by the Court in its 1962 Judgment. The Court said then in this
respect:

agreed to submit under Article 7 of the Mandate. Such obligation is
embodied in Article 37 of the Statute, which forms an integral part of the
Charter.

This transferred obligation was voluntarily assumed by the Respondent
when joining the United Nations. There can be no question of lack of
consent as regard this transfer of Respondent’s obligation to this Court,
under Article 7 of the Mandate, to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction
of the Permanent Court.

The validity of Article 7, in the Court’s view, was not affected by the
dissolution of the League, just as the Mandate as a whole is still in
force.

Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the last resolution of the League, adopted
unanimously on 18 April 1946, are in their letter and spirit principles
adopted by all Members of the United Nations as binding commitments
under the Charter.

The principle that “no interest no action”, does not necessarily mean
<‘material” interest, and the argument that the Applicants cannot invoke



the jurisdiction of the Court in a dispute with the Respondent, because
the said conflict or disagreement does not affect any material interest of
the Applicant States or their nationals, has no decisive weight.

When the Covenant and the Mandate were approved, the right of an
action before the Permanent Court was given to all Members of the
League, because they were understood to have an interest in the ob-
servance by the Mandatory of its obligations toward the inhabitants of
the territory and towards the Members of the League.

That interest was certainly far greater and superior to any material
interests of their own, and was the legal basis of their right of action.

The history of the Covenant and the mandates system, the purposes,

declare whether or not an official policy of racial discrimination is in
conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and in
harmony with principles of equality and non-discrimination based
on race or colour, proclaimed and accepted by the international com-
munity.

The arguments and evidence presented by the Respondent for the
purpose of attributing to the numerous resolutions on South West
Africa, adopted by the General Assembly during the past 20 years, a
political character and the claim that they have been politically inspired,
do in fact emphasize the duty of the Court to give weight and authority
to those resolutions of the General Assembly, as a source of rules and
standards of general acceptance by the States Members of the Inter-
national Organization.

The Court should also recognize those decisions as embodying reason-
able and just interpretations of the Charter, from which has evolved
international legal norms and/or standards, prohibiting racial discrimi-
nation and disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Many of the activities of the General Assembly and the Security
Council—among them, those relating to the problem of South West
Africa—are in the nature of political events concerned with the mainten-
ance of international peace, which is also the concern of the Court, whose
task is the pacific settlement of international disputes.

From those activities and under the impact of political factors, new
legal norms or standards emerge.

Examining the close interrelation between the political and legal
factors in the development of every branch of international law, Profes-
sor Rosenne makes some observations and comments which I consider
pertinent to quote:

“That interrelation explains the keenness with which elections of
Members of the Court are conducted ... But that interrelation
goes further. It explains the conflict of ideologies prevalent today

national Court, Vol. I, p. 4.)

“The Charter of the United Nations and the urgency of current
international problems and aspirations have turned the course of
the Organized International Society into new directions ... The
intellectual atmosphere in which the application today of inter-
national law is called, has changed, and with it the character of the


>

Court, as the Organ for applying international law, is changing too.’
(Zbid., pp. 5-6.)

Rosenne remarks also that the full impact upon the Court of those
changes is found in the activities of the General Assembly and the
Security Council.

Whatever conclusions one might draw from these activities, it is
evident that their far-reaching significance is the fact that the struggle
towards ending colonialism and racism in Africa, and everywhere, is the
overwhelming will of the international community of our days.

The Court, in my view, should take into consideration that consensus
of opinion.

The General Assembly, as a principal organ of the United Nations,
empowered to “discuss any questions or any matters within the scope
of the present Charter” (Article 10), especially those questions “relating
to the maintenance of international peace” (Article 11), and to “recom-
mend measures for the adjustment of any situation resulting from a
violation of the provisions of the Charter, setting forth the purposes
and principles of the United Nations”, has enacted, with respect to the
situation in South West Africa, numerous resolutions—in the legal
exercise of such functions and powers—resolutions which have the
character of rules of conduct, standards or norms of general acceptance,
condemning “racial discrimination” and violations of “human rights and
fundamental freedoms”, as contrary to the Charter, the Covenant and
the Mandate.

There is no principle of general international law which could be validly
invoked to contradict, or destroy, the essential purpose and the funda-
