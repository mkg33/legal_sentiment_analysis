1. T have voted in favour of the Court’s finding that it has no jurisdic-
tion to adjudicate upon the dispute submitted by Spain since this dispute
comes within the terms of the reservation contained in paragraph 2 (d)
of the Canadian declaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory
jurisdiction of 10 May 1994. I have done so, however, with a heavy heart,
since I am fully aware that this Judgment — although undoubtedly in
conformity with international law as it presently stands — bears testi-
mony to the inherent weakness of the system of compulsory jurisdiction
under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute, also called the optional
clause system, as it has developed in the course of time.

5. Since that time controversy only has arisen with regard to the ques-
tion whether reservations inconsistent with the Statute itself are admis-
sible. Although the Court itself never took position with regard to that
question, both in the Norwegian Loans case and the Interhandel case the
so-called “automatic reservation” and its validity under the Statute was a
matter for lively debate. According to Judge Lauterpacht and some of his
colleagues, Article 36, paragraph 6, of the Statute explicitly authorized
the Court and not the declarant State to decide whether in the event of a
dispute the Court has jurisdiction. A reservation in which the declarant
State reserves for itself the right to determine whether a dispute is essen-
tially within its national jurisdiction is “contrary to an express provision”
of the Statute and therefore must be deemed invalid.

6. In his famous separate opinion in the Norwegian Loans case Judge
Lauterpacht did not doubt, however, for one moment the right of a State
to make reservations which cannot be deemed to be contrary to the
Statute. He explicitly stated:

“In accepting the jurisdiction of the Court Governments are free
to limit its jurisdiction in a drastic manner. As a result there may be
little left in the Acceptance which is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Court. This the Governments, as trustees of the interests entrusted
to them, are fully entitled to do.”*

7. Nor have I found in doctrine a tendency to limit the legality —
which is something entirely different from the desirability — of making
reservations to declarations of acceptance (with the exception of reserva-
tions encroaching upon the Statute). I therefore cannot but share the
view of the Court, expressed in paragraph 54 of the Judgment, that “[t]he
fact that a State may lack confidence as to the compatibility of certain of
its actions with international law does not operate as an exception to the
principle of consent to the jurisdiction of the Court and the freedom to
enter reservations”. The Court has to apply the law as it is and I have not
found a scrap of evidence in State practice that contradicts the Court’s
View.

10. Asis clear from this statement, a State taking unilateral action on
a matter where international law apparently is in a state of flux is well
aware of the probability that such actions may lead to disputes with other
States. It may prefer to settle such disputes by other means than judicial
settlement because it is convinced that such other means may lead to a
resolution of the issue which in the end will be more satisfactory for all
States concerned. Under present international law States are perfectly
entitled to take such a position. In paragraph 56 of the Judgment the
Court refers in this respect to the principle of the free choice of means
contained in Article 33 of the Charter.

11. In the present case, however, Canada had made its choice and had
made a commitment to a particular method of dispute settlement by
accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. It is true that it had
explicitly stipulated in its declaration of 1985 that it could at any time
terminate its acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction or add to, amend or
withdraw the reservations contained in its declaration and that was
exactly what Canada did when it deposited its new declaration on
10 May 1994.

12. A State which is free to terminate its acceptance of the Court’s
compulsory jurisdiction at any time by the same token is legally free to
limit the scope of that acceptance. The question which in my opinion
must be put has, therefore, no legal purport but seems nevertheless legiti-
mate. The question which presents itself in the present case (but not for
the first time) is: how far can a State go in strengthening the system of
compulsory jurisdiction by depositing a declaration of acceptance while
at the same time making reservations which impair its effectiveness?

15. The optional clause system is a fragile system. The high expecta-
tions of the founders of the Permanent Court of International Justice
have not come true. The prospects of a comprehensive system of com-
pulsory jurisdiction reached their peak in the 1930s but at present it may
at best be called a beckoning ideal. Nevertheless, an increasing number of
States are finding their way to the Court and also the number of States
which have deposited a declaration of acceptance is slowly but steadily
increasing. Under these circumstances it would in my opinion not have
been beyond the Court’s mandate to draw attention to the fragility of the
system of compulsory jurisdiction which in the form of the optional
clause system is an integral and essential part of the Statute and to the
risks to which it is exposed. This all the more so since in its recent Judg-
ment in the case concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between
Cameroon and Nigeria, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
1998, the Court emphasized — be it on a strictly legal basis — the impor-
tance of that system.

20. I certainly do not contend that what is contained in the above quo-
tations is fully reflected in the optional clause system as it has developed
until today. Nevertheless I strongly feel that the gist of that content, viz.,
that compulsory jurisdiction is more than just another method of settling
legal disputes, should function as a point of reference for the Court's
evaluation of the optional clause system. Since the Court’s Judgment —
inevitable as it is — does not bring us any nearer to the qualitative
criteria referred to here, I have voted for the finding of the Court with
dismay; I found it necessary to give expression to my disquiet which is in
no way restricted to the present case.
