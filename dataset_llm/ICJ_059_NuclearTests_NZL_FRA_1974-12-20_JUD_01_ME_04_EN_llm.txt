Adhering as I do to the reasons relied on in the dissenting opinion
which I appended to the Order of 22 June 1973, I do not see that there
would be any point in repeating the arguments already developed in the
separate opinion which I have appended to the Judgment also delivered
today in the case between Australia and France; these arguments and
reasons apply mutatis mutandis to the Judgment in the present case.
