15. It is to be regretted that the French Government has failed to
appear in order to put forward its arguments on the issues arising in the
present phase of the proceedings, and the Court has thus not had the
assistance it might have derived from such arguments or from any evi-
dence adduced in support of them. The Court nevertheless has to proceed
and reach a conclusion, and in doing so must have regard not only to the
evidence brought before it and the arguments addressed to it by the
Applicant, but also to any documentary or other evidence which may be
relevant. It must on this basis satisfy itself, first that there exists no bar to
the exercise of its judicial function, and secondly, if no such bar exists,
that the Application is well founded in fact and in law.

16. The present case relates to a dispute between the Government of
New Zealand and the French Government concerning the legality of
atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by the latter Government in the
South Pacific region. Since in the present phase of the proceedings the
Court has to deal only with preliminary matters, it is appropriate to
recall that its approach to a phase of this kind must be, as it was expressed
in the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases, as follows:

“The issue being thus limited, the Court will avoid not only all
expressions of opinion on matters of substance, but also any pro-
nouncement which might prejudge or appear to prejudge any even-
tual decision on the merits.” (/.C.J. Reports 1973, pp. 7 and 54.)

It will however be necessary to give a summary of the principal facts



21. The Application founds the jurisdiction of the Court on the follow-
ing basis:

“(a) Articles 36 (1) and 37 of the Statute of the Court and Article 17
of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes, done at Geneva on 26 September 1928; and, in the
alternative,

(b) Article 36 (2) and (5) of the Statute of the Court.”

22. The scope of the present phase of the proceedings was defined by
the Court’s Order of 22 June 1973, by which the Parties were called upon
to argue, in the first instance, questions of the jurisdiction of the Court
and the admissibility of the Application. For this reason, as already
indicated, not only the Parties but also the Court itself must refrain from
entering into the merits of the claim. However, while examining these
questions of a preliminary character, the Court is entitled, and in some
circumstances may be required, to go into other questions which may not
be strictly capable of classification as matters of jurisdiction or admissibi-
lity but are of such a nature as to require examination in priority to those
matters.

23. In this connection, it should be emphasized that the Court possesses
an inherent jurisdiction enabling it to take such action as may be required,
on the one hand to ensure that the exercise of its jurisdiction over the
merits, if and when established, shall not be frustrated, and on the other,
to provide for the orderly settlement of all matters in dispute, to ensure
the observance of the “inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial
function” of the Court, and to “maintain its judicial character” (Northern
Cameroons, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, at p. 29). Such inherent juris-
diction, on the basis of which the Court is fully empowered to make
whatever findings may be necessary for the purposes just indicated,
derives from the mere existence of the Court as a judicial organ established
by the consent of States, and is conferred upon it in order that its basic
judicial functions may be safeguarded.

24. With these considerations in mind, the Court has therefore first
to examine a question which it finds to be essentially preliminary, namely
the existence of a dispute, for, whether or not the Court has jurisdiction
in the present case, the resolution of that question could exert a decisive
influence on the continuation of the proceedings. It will therefore be
necessary to make a detailed analysis of the claim submitted to the Court
by the Application of New Zealand. The present phase of the proceedings
having been devoted solely to preliminary questions, the Applicant has
not had the opportunity of fully expounding its contentions on the
merits. However the Application, which is required by Article 40 of the
Statute of the Court to indicate “‘the subject of the dispute”, must be the
point of reference for the consideration by the Court of the nature and
existence of the dispute brought before it.

agreement. In particular, the French Government did not feel able
to give the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand the assurance
which he sought, namely that the French programme of atmospheric
nuclear testing in the South Pacific had come to an end.”

And in a letter to the President of the French Republic by the Prime
Minister of New Zealand dated 4 May 1973, following those discussions,
the Prime Minister said:

“Since France has not agreed to our request that nuclear weapons
testing in the atmosphere of the South Pacific be brought to an end,
and since the French Government does not accept New Zealand’s
view that these tests are unlawful, the New Zealand Government
sees no alternative to its proceeding with the submission of its dispute
with France to the International Court of Justice.

I stress again that we see this as the one question at issue between
us, and that our efforts are solely directed at removing it from
contention.”

27. Further light is thrown on the nature of the New Zealand claim
by the reaction of New Zealand, both through its successive Prime
Ministers and through its representatives before the Court, to the state-



ments, referred to in paragraph 20 above, made on behalf of France and
relating to nuclear tests in the South Pacific region. In the course of the
oral proceedings, the Attorney-General of New Zealand outlined the
history of the dispute, and included in this review mention of diplomatic
correspondence exchanged between 10 June and | July 1974 by France
and New Zealand, which was communicated to the Court on 3 July by
the Applicant, and of a communiqué issued by the Office of the President
of the French Republic on 8 June 1974. The Attorney-General’s com-
ments on these documents, which are thus part of the record in the case,
indicated that they merited analysis as possible evidence of a certain
development in the controversy between the Parties, though at the same
time he made it clear that this development was not, in his Government’s
view, of such a nature as to resolve the dispute to its satisfaction. More
particularly, when referring to a Note of 10 June 1974 from the French
Embassy in Wellington to the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(quoted in paragraph 36 below) he stated: “New Zealand has not been
given anything in the nature of an unqualified assurance that 1974 will
see the end of atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific”. The At-
torney-General continued:

“On 11 June the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Kirk, asked
the French Ambassador in Wellington to convey a letter to the
President of France. Copies of that letter have been filed with the
Registry. It urged among other things that the President should, even
at that time, weigh the implications of any further atmospheric
testing in the Pacific and resolve to put an end to an activity which
has been the source of grave anxiety to the people of the Pacific region
for more than a decade.” (Hearing of 10 July 1974.)

It is clear from these statements, read in the light of the diplomatic
correspondence referred to above, that if the Note of 10 June 1974
could have been construed by New Zealand as conveying “an unqualified
assurance that 1974 [would] see the end of atmospheric nuclear testing”
by France “in the South Pacific”, or if the President of the Republic,
following the letter of 11 June 1974, did “resolve to put an end to [that]
activity”, the applicant Government would have regarded its objective as
having been achieved.

28. Subsequently, on | November 1974, the Prime Minister of New
Zealand, Mr. W. E. Rowling, commented in a public statement on the
indications given by France of its intention to put an end to atmospheric
tests in the Pacific, and said:

“It should... be clearly understood that nothing said by the
French Government, whether to New Zealand or to the international
community at large, has amounted to an assurance that there will



be no further atmospheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific. The
option of further atmospheric tests has been left open. Until we have
an assurance that nuclear testing of this kind is finished for good, the
dispute between New Zealand and France persists...” (Emphasis
added.)

Without commenting for the moment on the Prime Minister’s inter-
pretation of the French statements, the Court would observe that the
passage italicized above clearly implies that an assurance that atmospheric
testing is “finished for good” would, in the view of New Zealand, bring
the dispute to an end.

29. The type of tests to which the proceedings relate is described in the
Application as ‘nuclear tests in the South Pacific region that gave rise to
radio-active fall-out”, the type of testing contemplated not being specified.
However, New Zealand’s case has been argued mainly in relation to
atmospheric tests; and the statements quoted in paragraphs 26, 27 and 28
above, particularly those of successive Prime Ministers of New Zealand,
of 11 June and ! November 1974, show that an assurance ‘‘that nuclear
testing of this kind”, that is to say, testing in the atmosphere, ‘‘is finished
for good” would meet the object of the New Zealand claim. The Court
therefore considers that, for purposes of the Application, the New Zealand
claim is to be interpreted as applying only to atmospheric tests, not to any
other form of testing, and as applying only to atmospheric tests so con-
ducted as to give rise to radio-active fall-out on New Zealand territory.

35. It will be convenient to take the statements referred to above in
chronological order. The first statement is contained in the communiqué
issued by the Office of the President of the French Republic on 8 June
1974, shortly before the commencement of the 1974 series of French
nuclear tests:

“The Decree reintroducing the security measures in the South
Pacific nuclear test zone has been published in the Official Journal
of 8 June 1974.

The Office of the President of the Republic takes this opportunity
of stating that in view of the stage reached in carrying out the French
nuclear defence programme France will be in a position to pass on
to the stage of underground explosions as soon as the series of tests
planned for this summer is completed.”

36. The second is contained in a Note of 10 June 1974 from the French
Embassy in Wellington to the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

“It should . . . be pointed out that the decision taken by the Office
of the President of the French Republic to have the opening of the
nuclear test series preceded by a press communiqué represents a
departure from the practice of previous years. This procedure has
been chosen in view of the fact that a new element has intervened in
the development of the programme for perfecting the French
deterrent force. This new element is as follows: France, at the point
which has been reached in the execution of its programme of defence



NUCLEAR TESTS (JUDGMENT)

by nuclear means, will be in a position to move to the stage of under-
ground firings as soon as the test series planned for this summer is
completed.

Thus the atmospheric tests which will be carried out shortly will,
in the normal course of events, be the last of this type.

The French authorities express the hope that the New Zealand
Government will find this information of some interest and will wish
to take it into consideration.”

37. As indicated by counsel for the Applicant at the hearing of 10 July
1974, the reaction of the New Zealand Prime Minister to this second
statement was expressed in a letter to the President of the French Repub-
lic dated 11 June 1974, from which the following are two extracts:

*. . [have noted that the terms of the announcement do not represent
an unqualified renunciation of atmospheric testing for the future.”

“I would hope that even at this stage you would be prepared to
weigh the implications of any further atmospheric testing in the
Pacific and resolve to put an end to this activity which has been the
source of grave anxiety to the people in the Pacific region for more
than a decade.”

Thus the phrase “in the normal course of events’ was regarded by New
Zealand as qualifying the statement made, so that it did not meet the
expectations of the Applicant, which evidently regarded those words as a
form of escape clause. This is clear from the observations of counsel for
New Zealand at the hearing of 10 July 1974. In a Note of 17 June 1974,
the New Zealand Embassy in Paris stated that it had good reason to
believe that France had carried out an atmospheric nuclear test on 16 June
and made this further comment:

“The announcement that France will proceed to underground
tests in 1975, while presenting a new development, does not affect
New Zealand’s fundamental opposition to all nuclear testing, nor
does it in any way reduce New Zealand’s opposition to the atmos-
pheric tests set down for this year: the more so since the French
Government is unable to give firm assurances that no atmospheric
testing will be undertaken after 1974.”

38. The third French statement is contained in a reply made on 1 July
1974 by the President of the Republic to the New Zealand Prime Minis-
ter’s letter of 11 June:


“In present circumstances, it is at least gratifying for me to note
the positive reaction in your letter to the announcement in the
communiqué of 8 June 1974 that we are going over to underground


tests. There is in this a new element whose importance will not, 1
trust, escape the New Zealand Government.”

39. These three statements were all drawn to the notice of the Court
by the Applicant at the time of the oral proceedings. As already indicated,
the Court will also have to consider the relevant statements subsequently
made by the French authorities: on 25 July 1974 by the President of the
Republic; on 16 August 1974 by the Minister of Defence; on 25 Septem-
ber 1974 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the United Nations
General Assembly; and on 11 October 1974 by the Minister of Defence.

40. The next statement to be considered, therefore, will be that made
on 25 July at a press conference given by the President of the Republic,
when he said:

“...on this question of nuclear tests, you know that the Prime
Minister had publicly expressed himself in the National Assembly
in his speech introducing the Government's programme. He had
indicated that French nuclear testing would continue. I had myself
made it clear that this round of atmospheric tests would be the last,
and so the members of the Government were completely informed
of our intentions in this respect . . .”

41. On 16 August 1974, in the course of an interview on French
television, the Minister of Defence said that the French Government had
done its best to ensure that the 1974 nuclear tests would be the last
atmospheric tests.

42. On 25 September 1974, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs,
addressing the United Nations General Assembly, said:

“We have now reached a stage in our nuclear technology that
makes it possible for us to continue our programme by underground
testing, and we have taken steps to do so as early as next year.”

43. On 11 October 1974, the Minister of Defence held a press con-
ference during which he stated twice, in almost identical terms, that
there would not be any atmospheric tests in 1975 and that France was
ready to proceed to underground tests. When the comment was made
that he had not added “in the normal course of events”, he agreed that
he had not. This latter point is relevant in view of the Note of 10 June
1974 from the French Embassy in Wellington to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of New Zealand (paragraph 36 above), to the effect that the atmos-
pheric tests contemplated “will, in the normal course of events, be the
last of this type”. The Minister also mentioned that, whether or not
other governments had been officially advised of the decision, they could
become aware of it through the press and by reading the communiqués
issued by the Office of the President of the Republic.



44. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the communiqué
issued on 8 June 1974 (paragraph 35 above), the French Embassy’s Note of
10 June 1974 (paragraph 36 above) and the President’s letter of 1 July 1974
(paragraph 38) conveyed to New Zealand the announcement that France,
following the conclusion of the 1974 series of tests, would cease the
conduct of atmospheric nuclear tests. Special attention is drawn to the
hope expressed in the Note of 10 June 1974 ‘‘that the New Zealand
Government will find this information of some interest and will wish
to take it into consideration”, and the reference in that Note and in the
letter of 1 July 1974 to “a new element” whose importance is urged upon
the New Zealand Government. The Court must consider in particular
the President’s statement of 25 July 1974 (paragraph 40 above) followed
by the Defence Minister’s statement of 11 October 1974 (paragraph 43).
These reveal that the official statements made on behalf of France con-
cerning future nuclear testing are not subject to whatever proviso, if any,
was implied by the expression “in the normal course of events /normale-
ment ]”.

45. Before considering whether the declarations made by the French
authorities meet the object of the claim by the Applicant that no further
atmospheric nuclear tests should be carried out in the South Pacific, it is
first necessary to determine the status and scope on the international
plane of these declarations.

46. It is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral
acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating
legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very
specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that
it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on
the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being
thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with
the declaration. An undertaking of this kind, if given publicly, and with
an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of inter-
national negotiations, is binding. In these circumstances, nothing in
the nature of a quid pro quo, nor any subsequent acceptance of the
declaration, nor even any reply or reaction from other States, is required
for the declaration to take effect, since such a requirement would be
inconsistent with the strictly unilateral nature of the juridical act by which
the pronouncement by the State was made.

47. Of course, not all unilateral acts imply obligation; but a State
may choose to take up a certain position in relation to a particular matter
with the intention of being bound—the intention is to be ascertained by



interpretation of the act. When States make statements by which their
freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is called
for.

48. With regard to the question of form, it should be observed that
this is not a domain in which international law imposes any special or
strict requirements. Whether a statement is made orally or in writing
makes no essential difference, for such statements made in particular
circumstances may create commitments in international law, which
does not require that they should be couched in written form. Thus the
question of form is not decisive. As the Court said in its Judgment on the
preliminary objections in the case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear:

“Where . . . as is generally the case in international law, which
places the principal emphasis on the intention of the parties, the law
prescribes no particular form, parties are free to choose what form
they please provided their intention clearly results from it.” (/.C.J.
Reports 1961, p. 31.)

The Court further stated in the same case: ““. . . the sole relevant question
is whether the language employed in any given declaration does reveal a
clear intention . . .” (ibid., p. 32).

49. One of the basic principles governing the creation and performance
of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith.
Trust and confidence are inherent in international co-operation, in parti-
cular in an age when this co-operation in many fields is becoming
increasingly essential. Just as the very rule of pacta sunt servanda in the
law of treaties is based on good faith, so also is the binding character of an
international obligation assumed by unilateral declaration. Thus inter-
ested States may take cognizance of unilateral declarations and place
confidence in them, and are entitled to require that the obligation thus
created be respected.

50. Having examined the legal principles involved, the Court will now
turn to the particular statements made by the French Government.
The Government of New Zealand has made known to the Court its own
interpretation of some of these statements at the oral proceedings (para-
graph 27 above). As to subsequent statements, reference may be made to
what was said by the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 1 November 1974
(paragraph 28 above). It will be observed that New Zealand has recog-
nized the possibility of the dispute being resolved by a unilateral declara-
tion, of the kind specified above, on the part of France. In the public
statement of ! November 1974, it is stated that “Until we have an assur-
ance that nuclear testing of this kind is finished for good, the dispute
between New Zealand and France persists”. This is based on the view



that “the option of further atmospheric tests has been left open”. The
Court must however form its own view of the meaning and scope intended
by the author of a unilateral declaration which may create a legal obli-
gation, and cannot in this respect be bound by the view expressed by
another State which is in no way a party to the text.

51. Of the statements by the French Government now before the
Court, the most essential are clearly those made by the President of the
Republic. There can be no doubt, in view of his functions, that his public
communications or statements, oral or written, as Head of State, are in
international relations acts of the French State. His statements, and those
of members of the French Government acting under his authority, up to
the last statement made by the Minister of Defence (of 11 October 1974),
constitute a whole. Thus, in whatever form these statements were expres-
sed, they must be held to constitute an engagement of the State, having
regard to their intention and to the circumstances in which they were
made.

52. The unilateral statements of the French authorities were made
outside the Court, publicly and erga omnes, even if some of them were
communicated to the Government of New Zealand. As was observed
above, to have legal effect, there was no need for these statements to be
addressed to a particular State, nor was acceptance by any other State
required. The general nature and characteristics of these statements are
decisive for the evaluation of the legal implications, and it is to the inter-
pretation of the statements that the Court must now proceed. The Court
is entitled to presume, at the outset, that these statements were not made
in vacuo, but in relation to the tests which constitute the very object of the
present proceedings, although France has not appeared in the case.

53. In announcing that the 1974 series of atmospheric tests would
be the last, the French Government conveyed to the world at large,
including the Applicant, its intention effectively to terminate these tests.
It was bound to assume that other States might take note of these state-
ments and rely on their being effective. The validity of these statements
and their legal consequences must be considered within the general
framework of the security of international intercourse, and the confidence
and trust which are so essential in the relations among States. It is from
the actual substance of these statements and from the circumstances
attending their making, that the legal implications of the unilateral act
must be deduced. The objects of these statements are clear and they were
addressed to the international community as a whole, and the Court
holds that they constitute an undertaking possessing legal effect. The
Court considers that the President of the Republic, in deciding upon the
effective cessation of atmospheric tests, gave an undertaking to the inter-
national community to which his words were addressed. It is true that the
French Government has consistently maintained that its nuclear experi-



ments do not contravene any subsisting provision of international law,
nor did France recognize that it was bound by any rule of international
law to terminate its tests, but this does not affect the legal consequences of
the statements examined above. The Court finds that the unilateral under-
taking resulting from these statements cannot be interpreted as having
been made in implicit reliance on an arbitrary power of reconsideration.
The Court finds further that the French Government has undertaken an
obligation the precise nature and limits of which must be understood in
accordance with the actual terms in which they have been publicly ex-
pressed.

54. The Court will now confront the commitment entered into by
France with the claim advanced by the Applicant. Though the latter
has formally requested from the Court a finding on the rights and obliga-
tions of the Parties, it has throughout the dispute maintained as its final
objective the termination of the tests. It has sought from France an
assurance that the French programme of atmospheric nuclear testing
would come to an end. While expressing its opposition to the 1974 tests,
the Government of New Zealand made specific reference to an assurance
that “1974 will see the end of atmospheric nuclear testing in the South
Pacific” (paragraph 33 above). On more than one occasion it has indicated
that it would be ready to accept such an assurance. Since the Court now
finds that a commitment in this respect has been entered into by France,
there is no occasion for a pronouncement in respect of rights and obli-
gations of the Parties concerning the past—which in other circumstances
the Court would be entitled and even obliged to make—whatever the
date by reference to which such pronouncement might be made.

55. Thus the Court faces a situation in which the objective of the
Applicant has in effect been accomplished, inasmuch as the Court finds
that France has undertaken the obligation to hold no further nuclear
tests in the atmosphere in the South Pacific.

56. This conclusion is not affected by a reference made by the New
Zealand Government, in successive diplomatic Notes to the French
Government from 1966 to 1974, to a formal reservation of “the right to
hold the French Government responsible for any damage or losses
received by New Zealand ... as a result of any nuclear weapons tests
conducted by France”; for no mention of any request for damages is
“made in the Application, and at the public hearing of 10 July 1974 the
Attorney-General of New Zealand specifically stated: “My Government
seeks a halt to a hazardous and unlawful activity, and not compensation
for its continuance.” The Court therefore finds that no question of
damages in respect of tests already conducted arises in the present case.

57. It must be assumed that had New Zealand received an assurance,
on one of the occasions when this was requested, which, in its inter-
pretation, would have been satisfactory, it would have considered the
dispute as concluded and would have discontinued the proceedings in



accordance with the Rules of Court. If it has not done so, this does not
prevent the Court from making its own independent finding on the sub-
ject. It is true that “the Court cannot take into account declarations,
admissions or proposals which the Parties may have made during direct
negotiations between themselves, when such negotiations have not led to a
complete agreement” (Factory at Chorzéw (Merits), P.C.1.J., Series A,
No. 17, p. 51). However, in the present case, that is not the situation
before the Court. The Applicant has clearly indicated what would satisfy
its claim, and the Respondent has independently taken action; the ques-
tion for the Court is thus one of interpretation of the conduct of each of
the Parties. The conclusion at which the Court has arrived as a result
of such interpretation does not mean that it is itself effectinga compromise
of the claim; the Court is merely ascertaining the object of the claim and
the effect of the Respondent’s action, and this it is obliged to do. Any
suggestion that the dispute would not be capable of being terminated by
statements made on behalf of France would run counter to the unequivo-
cally expressed views of the Applicant both before the Court and else-
where.

58. The Court, as a court of law, is called upon to resolve existing
disputes between States. Thus the existence of a dispute is the primary
condition for the Court to exercise its judicial function; it is not sufficient
for one party to assert that there is a dispute, since “whether there exists
an international dispute is a matter for objective determination” by the
Court (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and
Romania (First Phase), Advisory Opinion, 1.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).
The dispute brought before it must therefore continue to exist at the
time when the Court makes its decision. It must not fail to take cogni-
zance of a situation in which the dispute has disappeared because the final
objective which the Applicant has maintained throughout has been
achieved by other means. If the declarations of France concerning the
effective cessation of the nuclear tests have the significance described
by the Court, that is to say if they have caused the dispute to disappear, all
the necessary consequences must be drawn from this finding.

59. It may be argued that although France may have undertaken
such an obligation, by a unilateral declaration, not to carry out atmos-
pheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific region, a judgment of the Court
on this subject might still be of value because, if the Judgment upheld
the Applicant’s contentions, it would reinforce the position of the Appli-
cant by affirming the obligation of the Respondent. However, the Court
having found that the Respondent has assumed an obligation as to
conduct, concerning the effective cessation of nuclear tests, no further
judicial action is required. The Applicant has repeatedly sought from the
Respondent an assurance that the tests would cease, and the Respondent
has, on its own initiative, made a series of statements to the effect that they
will cease. Thus the Court concludes that, the dispute having disappeared,
the claim advanced by New Zealand no longer has any object. It follows
that any further finding would have no raison d’étre.



60. This is not to say that the Court may select from the cases sub-
mitted to it those it feels suitable for judgment while refusing to give
judgment in others. Article 38 of the Court’s Statute provides that its
function is ‘to decide in accordance with international law such disputes
as are submitted to it”; but not only Article 38 itself but other provisions
of the Statute and Rules also make it clear that the Court can exercise
its jurisdiction in contentious proceedings only when a dispute genuinely
exists between the parties. In refraining from further action in this case the
Court is therefore merely acting in accordance with the proper inter-
pretation of its judicial function.

61. The Court has in the past indicated considerations which would
lead it to decline to give judgment. The present case is one in which
“circumstances that have ... arisen render any adjudication devoid of
purpose” (Northern Cameroons, Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 38).
The Court therefore sees no reason to allow the continuance of proceed-
ings which it knows are bound to be fruitless. While judicial settlement
may provide a path to international harmony in circumstances of con-
flict, it is none the less true that the needless continuance of litigation is
an obstacle to such harmony.

64. In its above-mentioned Order of 22 June 1973, the Court stated
that the provisional measures therein set out were indicated “pending
its final decision in the proceedings instituted on 9 May 1973 by New



Zealand against France”. It follows that such Order ceases to be operative
upon the delivery of the present Judgment, and that the provisional
measures lapse at the same time.
