141     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   Land boundary in the northern part of Isla Portillos.
   Issues concerning territorial sovereignty.
   Principle of res judicata — Paragraphs 69-70 of the Court’s 2015 Judgment —
Question of sovereignty over coast of northern part of Isla Portillos expressly
excluded — Issue thus not res judicata — Nicaragua’s claim concerning sover-
eignty admissible.

   2015 Judgment finding territory under Costa Rican sovereignty extends to right
bank of San Juan River at its mouth — Uncertainties about configuration of coast
of Isla Portillos in 2015 — Assessment of Court-appointed experts — No longer
any water channel connecting San Juan River and Harbor Head Lagoon —
Costa Rica has sovereignty over whole of Isla Portillos except enclave of Harbor
Head Lagoon and sandbar separating it from sea, over which Nicaragua has sov-
ereignty — Starting-point of land boundary currently at end of sandspit at mouth
of San Juan River — Extent of sandbar as measured by experts — Course of land
boundary for enclave of Harbor Head Lagoon.




                                        *

   Alleged violations of Costa Rica’s sovereignty — Military camp not on sandbar
appertaining to Nicaragua — Installation of military camp violated Costa Rica’s
sovereignty — Camp must be removed from Costa Rican territory — No breach
of 2015 Judgment — Declaration of breach of sovereignty and order to remove
camp constitute appropriate reparation.

   Maritime delimitation in the Caribbean Sea.
   Starting-point — Divergent views of the Parties — Instability of the coastline
near mouth of River — Impossibility to identify on sandspit a fixed starting-point
for maritime delimitation — Use of fixed point at sea — Mobile line connecting
fixed point to coast — Coastal recession as prevailing phenomenon — Two nauti-
cal miles appropriate distance from coast for fixed point.


                                        *

   Delimitation of the territorial sea — Two-stage procedure — First stage, con-
struction of provisional median line — Only base points on natural coast and solid
land used — Second stage, consideration whether special circumstances justify
adjustment of median line — Concavity/convexity of coast near starting-point not
a special circumstance — Instability and narrowness of sandspit at mouth of river
is a special circumstance — Appropriateness of mobile line between fixed point at
sea and point on solid land on Costa Rican coast closest to mouth of river — Pres-
ent location of mobile line — Instability of sandbar separating Harbor Head
Lagoon from sea is a special circumstance — Delimitation of territorial sea will

not take into account any entitlement which might result from enclave of Harbor
Head Lagoon — Course of delimitation line in territorial sea.

   Delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.
   Relevant coasts — Entire mainland coast of Costa Rica relevant — Mainland
coast of Nicaragua up to Punta Gorda (north) relevant — Coasts of Corn Islands
that do not face north also relevant — Coasts of Cayos de Perlas not relevant —
Coastal lengths measured according to natural configuration.

   Relevant area — Limits of relevant area in the north — Claims of third States
in the south.
   Relevance of bilateral treaties and judgments involving third States —
1976 Treaty between Panama and Colombia not relevant between the Parties —
With regard to 1977 Treaty between Costa Rica and Colombia, any possible
renunciation of maritime entitlements by Costa Rica not shown to be renunciation
in favour of other States.
   Methodology of delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and continental
shelf in three stages — First stage, construction of provisional equidistance line —
Second stage, determination whether relevant circumstances justify adjustment
of equidistance line — Third stage, verification of absence of marked dispropor-
tionality.
   Provisional equidistance line — Determination of base points — Natural coast
and solid land used for base points — Base points on Corn Islands — Base points
on Paxaro Bovo and Palmenta Cays — Line without prejudice to any claims of
third States — Course of provisional equidistance line.

   Adjustment to provisional equidistance line — Corn Islands given half effect —
Concavity/convexity of coast near Punta de Castilla not a relevant circumstance —
Overall concavity of Costa Rica’s coast not a relevant circumstance — No signifi-
cant cut-off of Costa Rica’s projections once half effect given to Corn
Islands — Course of adjusted equidistance line — Line without prejudice to any
claims of third States — Adoption of simplified line on the basis of most significant
turning points — Course of simplified line.

   Disproportionality test — No need to achieve strict proportionality — Impos-
sible to calculate relevant area precisely due to potential claims of third States —
Approximate calculation sufficient to test for gross disproportion — Calculation
based on notional extension of Costa Rica-Panama boundary — No disproportion-
ality such as to create an inequitable result.

  Maritime delimitation in the Pacific Ocean.
  Starting-point — Parties agreement to use midpoint of closing line of Salinas
Bay — Precise co-ordinates of that point.

143     maritime delimitation and land boundary (judgment)

   Delimitation of the territorial sea — Parties agree on base points for construc-
tion of provisional median line — Court adopts base points selected by Parties —
Santa Elena Peninsula not a special circumstance justifying adjustment of median
line — Course of delimitation line in territorial sea.

                                        *
   Delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.
   Relevant coasts — Relevant coasts of both Parties identified using straight
lines — Entire Nicaraguan coast relevant — Costa Rican coast running along
straight lines connecting Punta Zacate, Punta Santa Elena, Cabo Velas,
Punta Guiones and Cabo Blanco relevant —Costa Rican coast running along
straight lines connecting Punta Herradura, Osa Peninsula, Punta Llorona and
Punta Salsipuedes also relevant — Coasts of Nicoya Gulf not relevant — Coastal
lengths measured along straight lines.
   Relevant area — Limits of relevant area in north — Limits of relevant area in
west and south.
   Provisional equidistance line — Parties agree on base points — Court adopts
base points selected by Parties — Course of provisional equidistance line.

   Adjustment to provisional equidistance line — Santa Elena Peninsula given half
effect — Nicoya Peninsula not a relevant circumstance justifying adjustment —
Course of adjusted equidistance line — Adoption of simplified line on the basis of
most significant turning points — Course of simplified line.

   Disproportionality test — No disproportionality such as to create an inequitable
result.
