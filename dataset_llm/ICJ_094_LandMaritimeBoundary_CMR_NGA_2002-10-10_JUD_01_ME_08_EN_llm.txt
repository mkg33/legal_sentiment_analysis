1. I share the findings reached by the Court; it is absolutely correct:

(a) in concluding, in respect of the Lake Chad region, having deter-
mined the endpoint of the lake boundary at the “mouth of the
Ebeji”, that

— “as regards the settlements situated to the east of the frontier
confirmed in the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of Notes of
1931, sovereignty has continued to lie with Cameroon”; and

(b) in confirming, as regards Bakassi, that “sovereignty over the penin-
sula lies with Cameroon”.

In so doing, the Court has made the law prevail over the fait accompli.

3. Like the Parties, the Court divided the boundary into a number of
sectors:

— the Lake Chad region,

— the land boundary between Lake Chad and Bakassi,
— Bakassi,

— the maritime boundary.

5. Although I voted in favour of the entire dispositif of the Judgment,
I felt that it would be appropriate to draft a separate opinion setting out
a number of considerations emphasizing certain points that I regard
as being of particular significance, or addressing issues on which my
responses may be somewhat different to those given by the Court. In the
present opinion I will confine myself to brief comments on the Lake Chad
region and Bakassi, after saying a few words about the principle of the
intangibility of colonial frontiers, before going on to make a number of
observations on maritime delimitation and on the issue of responsibility.

an impressive list of the substantial roles which Nigeria has played and
continues to play in Africa.

It is a fact that, in Africa, Nigeria is perceived as a Power not only in
demographic terms (120 million inhabitants), but also in economic, social
and military terms. Within the sub-region where it is situated, that State
is both respected and feared, and those feelings extend over a good part
of western and central Africa. It is not impossible that Nigeria seeks, to
some extent and indeed quite legitimately, to derive advantage from that
fear which it inspires. The circumstances and events of the present dis-
pute would certainly not contradict such an observation.

2. The Means Chosen by the Parties to Defend Their Positions

9. Each of the Parties to the present dispute chose the ground on
which it wished to position itself in order to argue its case.



LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. OP. MBAYE) 508

Thus in this case, from the filing of the Application right up to the end
of the oral pleadings, one had the impression that there was one Party
which clung for all it was worth to the letter of the law, and one which
relied more on facts, albeit dressed up in a legal guise.

10. On the one side we had Cameroon, which had placed the matter
before the OAU, then the United Nations, and then the Court, and on
the other there was Nigeria, which had criticized Cameroon for each of
these initiatives concerning an issue which, according to Nigeria's repre-
sentatives, could have been settled by dialogue ard negotiation.

adopt the principle of uti possidetis juris (I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 565,
para. 22). At all costs they wanted to avoid 1aving the boundaries
bequeathed by the colonial Powers (however absurd, illogical or badly
drawn, and even where they divided ethnic grours or tribes), called into
question. This is clear from the fact that, at the conference of African
peoples held in Accra in December 1958 (thus less than six years before
the Cairo conference), African leaders stated in a resolution on frontiers
that: “the artificial barriers and boundaries drawn by imperialists to
divide the African peoples to the detriment of Afr:cans must be abolished
or adjusted . . .” (cited by Zidane Mériboute in Lz codification de la suc-

the intangibility of those frontiers.

16. That is why both Parties in the present case have paid particular
attention to the issue of respect for colonial boundaries. That is a further
reason why I feel I should return to that issue.

17. One of Nigeria's counsel stated at the hearing of 6 March 2002
that this is an important case and that the Cour:’s decision “will have
serious consequences”. He was absolutely right.

Indeed the whole of Africa has been awaiting the Court’s Judgment,


20. In relation to the Lake Chad region, the Court encountered the
issue of nationality/ethnicity conflicts that are so frequent in Africa.

We should never lose sight of the fact that, in Africa, the majority of
countries were attributed their nationality only some 50 years ago.

By contrast, ethnic groups have existed, and he ve often straddled the



LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. COP. MBAYE) 510

international boundaries between the new States, since time immemo-
rial.

As a result certain authors have written that in Africa, “contrary to
what occurred in Europe, the State preceded the Nation”, although this
may not always be the case.

21. Whatever the truth of the matter, a natioaality which has been
superimposed on ethnic groupings is, without the intervention of the
public authorities, felt much less strongly than ethnicity. It may very well
be that two Kanuris (an ethnic group in the Lak: Chad region) of dif-
ferent nationalities feel much closer to one another than a Kanuri and a
Hausa (another ethnic group in that region) of the same nationality. Cer-
tain serious problems of the African continent are explicable on this
basis. One can thus be easily led astray in good faith, attributing to
nationality what is solely a matter of ethnicity. Such a proposition might
be applied in the present case to the Lake Chad region and to the argu-
ments of Nigeria in this respect as regards the Nigerian villages.

It was this situation in Africa that impelled Pelissier to write in Les
Paysans du Sénégal, on page 23: “National consciousness has not erased
the rich diversity of a long past . . . Deeply Senegilese for a few decades
only, our regions have been since time immemorial . . . Wolof, Serer,
Toucouleur, Manding, Diola, Balant, etc. . . .”

22. Throughout the length of the boundary between Cameroon and
Nigeria, it would seem that, for a very long time and notwithstanding the
various political statuses enjoyed by these regions in the course of their
history (German, British or French possessions, independence), the indi-
genous populations have settled according to their ethnic affinities and
their economic needs in total disregard of territorial boundaries and
nationality, and that Governments have subseqiently sought to take
advantage of the particular situations thus created. This context did not
escape the attention of the Court in the present cise (see para. 67 of the
Judgment). That is why Africa’s salvation lies in respect for colonial
boundaries, expressed unequivocally and without recourse to subtle dis-
tinctions. Later on we will consider the two exceptions to this proposition.

SECTION 2. DETERMINATION OF THE COURSE OF THE LAKE AND LAND
BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE Two STATES

23. The Court, as always in disputes like the present case, has deter-
mined the boundary between the two countries with precision, without
assuming the role of a demarcation authority (para. 84 of the Judgment).

24. 1 deliberately use the word “determination” and am employing it
in a general sense which encompasses the terms “Jelimitation”, “demar-
cation” and “indication”. I find it particularly appropriate in the present
case, with “determine” meaning here: to indicae with precision. The
Court uses an equivalent term, in particular in pa-agraph 85 of its Judg-


LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. OP. MBAYE) 511

ment when it states the purpose of its task as being “to specify definitively
the course of the . . . boundary . . .” (emphasis added by the Court). It

Protectorates of Nigeria and on behalf of France by the Governor of the
French Cameroons, it is, in my view, together with the Notes and the
accompanying Moisel map, a legally valid agreement which binds the
two Parties in the present case.

27. Nigeria and Cameroon agree on this point. The Court clearly
stated that:

“the Thomson-Marchand Declaration, as approved and incorpo-
rated in the Henderson-Fleuriau Exchange of Notes, has the status
of an international agreement. The Court acknowledges that the
Declaration does have some technical imperf:ctions and that certain
details remained to be specified. However, it finds that the Declara-
tion provided for a delimitation that was sufficient in general for
demarcation.” (Para. 50 of the Judgment.)

28. However, as Nigeria had levied a certain number of criticisms at
the Declaration, it would not be unhelpful to address that one of those
criticisms which seems to me to carry the most weight for the Respon-
dent, notwithstanding the clear demonstration by the Court in reaching
the conclusion cited above.

B. Legal force and significance of the Thomson- Marchand Declaration

29. For Nigeria, the Exchange of Notes which might give the Thom-
son-Marchand Declaration the appearance of an agreement in reality did



LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. OP. MBAYE) 512

not fix the boundary between its territory and that of Cameroon. Nigeria
based its argument on the following provision of the Notes exchanged by
the French and British authorities, in which we read in almost identical
terms that:

“The Declaration is not the product of a boundary commission
constituted for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
Article 1 of the Mandate, but only the result of a preliminary survey
conducted in order to determine more exactly than was done
in the Milner-Simon Declaration of 1919 the line ultimately to be

40. As regards demarcation, according to Cameroon the Lake Chad
Basin Commission (LCBC) was charged with the task of undertaking the
demarcation of the boundary, although the Commission itself spoke of
delimitation (see Lagos Declaration of 21 June 1671).


LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. OP. MBAYE) 514

41. According to Nigeria, the LCBC also undertook a true delimita-
tion, which of course, in logical terms, justified the Respondent’s position
that there had been no prior delimitation. And Nigeria stressed the fact
that the demarcation works did not bind it, sinc: it had never accepted
their conclusions.

42. In its 1998 Judgment on the Preliminary Objections, the Court
described the LCBC’s task. In this regard, it speaks of demarcation.

43. Created in 1964, the LCBC became involved with the delimitation
of the boundary following incidents between Cameroon and Nigeria in
1983 in the Lake Chad region. The States concerned agreed to adopt as
working documents dealing with the “delimitation” of the boundaries in
Lake Chad “various bilateral treaties and agreements concluded between
Germany and Great Britain between 1906 and 1913”. The experts pro-
posed that the boundary as thus delimited “be demarcated”.

Thus the LCBC’s task was one of demarcation as the Court found
(I.C.J. Reports 1998, pp. 305, 307 and 308, paras 65 and 70) in its Judg-
ment on Nigeria's preliminary objections. This is reiterated by the Court
in paragraph 55 of the present Judgment, where it indicates: “The Court
observes that the LCBC had engaged for seven years in a technical exer-
cise of demarcation, on the basis of instruments that were agreed to be
the instruments delimiting the frontier in Lake Chad.”

D. Cartography

44. In the present case, there has been an outright battle of maps.

The old maps, in particular those used in the przparation of the Thom-
son-Marchand Declaration (especially the Moisel map), were heavily
criticized by Nigeria. One of its counsel charged that they contained
approximations and even errors, as well as gaps and contradictions.

45. Naturally, maps dating from 1919, 1930 or 1931 will inevitably
reflect the weaknesses of the contemporary techniques employed in their
preparation. But that is not a sufficient reason to reject en bloc the infor-
mation which they provide. Moreover, we should not forget what the
Court has said on maps in general:

“maps merely constitute information which varies in accuracy from
case to case; of themselves, and by virtue solely of their existence,
they cannot constitute a territorial title, that is, a document endowed
by international law with intrinsic legal force for the purpose of
establishing territorial rights. Of course, in some cases maps may
acquire such legal force, but where this is so the legal force does not
arise solely from their intrinsic merits: it is because such maps fall
into the category of physical expressions of the will of the State or
States concerned. This is the case, for example, when maps are
annexed to an official text of which they form an integral part.


LAND AND MARITIME BOUNDARY (SEP. OP. MBAYE) 515

Except in this clearly defined case, maps are only extrinsic evidence
of varying reliability or unreliability which may be used, along with
other evidence of a circumstantial kind, to establish or reconstitute
the real facts.” (Frontier Dispute (Burkina Fasol Republic of Mali)
LC.J. Reports 1986, p. 582, para. 54; see also KasikililSedudu Island
( BotswanalNamibia), I.C.J. Reports 1999 (11), p. 1098, para. 84.)

However, in the present case, the Anglo-German Agreement of 1913
does accord a certain importance to the maps (see final provisions of that
Agreement).

E. Effectivités and legal title

46. The debate in the present case largely focused on the opposition
between legal title and effectivités.

(1) General considerations

47. In order to make good the alleged absence cf delimitation, Nigeria
invoked effectivités — effectivités which confirmed its historic title. To
illustrate its argument, it cited the occupation of Darak and the sur-
rounding villages by Nigerians, together with a whole series of other facts
which, according to Nigeria, clearly demonstrated the exercise of its sov-
ereignty in the part of the Lake Chad area which it claimed. Nigeria even
contended that there had been acquiescence on the part of Cameroon.

48. The Court addresses this issue at length in paragraphs 64 er seq. of
its Judgment, stating clearly that: “any Nigerian effectivités are indeed to
be evaluated for their legal consequences as acts contra legem” (para. 64
of the Judgment).

The Court moreover rejected Nigeria's argument as to alleged acqui-
escence on the part of Cameroon.

49. 1 can only approve such conclusions; in particular, the absence of
any acquiescence by Cameroon in the present case is quite clear. Acqui-
escence to an extension of sovereignty over a portion of the national ter-
ritory of a State requires a long period and a clear and unequivocal
