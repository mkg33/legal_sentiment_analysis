First Preliminary Objection

The First Preliminary Objection of the Government of India is
to the effect that the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain
the Application of Portugal on the ground that the Portuguese
Declaration of Acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court of
December 19th, 1955, is invalid for the reason that the Third
Condition of the Declaration is incompatible with the object and
purpose of the Optional Clause. There are, in the view of the
Government of India, three main reasons for such incompatibility.

The Third Condition of the Declaration of Portugal provides as
follows: :

“3} The Portuguese Government reserves the right to exclude
from the scope of the present declaration, at any time during
its validity, any given category or categories of disputes, by
notifying the Secretary-General of the United Nations and
with effect from the moment of such notification.”



In the first instance, the Government of India maintains that
that Condition gives Portugal the right, by making at any time a
notification to that effect, to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the
Court a dispute which has been submitted to it prior to such a
notification. This is what in the course of the proceedings was
described as the retroactive effect attaching to that notification.
India asserts that such retroactive effect is incompatible with the
principle and notion of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court as
established in Article 36 of the Statute and that the Third Condition
is invalid inasmuch as it contemplates an effect which is contrary
to the Statute.

The Government of Portugal has contested that interpretation
and has affirmed that the Third Condition does not have such
retroactive effect and that, in consequence, it is not incompatible
with Article 36 of the Statute.

In order to decide whether, as maintained by the Government of
India, the Third Condition appended bv Portugal is invalid, and
whether such invalidity entails the invalidity of the Declaration
in which it is contained, the Court must determine the meaning and
the effect of the Third Condition by reference to its actual wording
and applicable principles of law.

The words “with effect from the moment of such notification”
cannot be construed as meaning that such a notification would have
retroactive effect so as to cover cases already pending before the
Court. Construed in their ordinary sense, these words mean simply
that a notification under the Third Condition applies only to dis-
putes brought before the Court after the date of the notification.
Such an interpretation leads to the conclusion that no retroactive
effect can properly be imputed to notifications made under the
Third Condition. It is a rule of law generally accepted, as well as
one acted upon in the past by the Court. that, once the Court has
been validly seised of a dispute, unilateral action by the respondent
State in terminating its Declaration, in whole or in part, cannot
divest the Court of jurisdiction. In the Nottebokm case the Court
gave expression to that principle in the following words:

“An extrinsic fact such as the subsequent lapse of the Declaration,
by reason of the expiry of the period or by denunciation, cannot
deprive the Court of the jurisdiction already established. > (I.Cc.J.

Reports 1953, p. 123.)

That statement by the Court must be deemed to apply both to
total denunciation, and to partial denunciation as contemplated in
the Third Portuguese Condition. It is a rule of interpretation that a
text emanating from a Government must, in principle, be inter-
preted as producing and as intended to produce effects tn accordance
with existing law and not in violation of it.


I43 RIGHT OF PASSAGE (PRELIM. OBJECTIONS) (JUDGM. 26 XI 57)

The second reason, contended for by the Government of India,
for the incompatibility of the Third Portuguese Condition with
the object and purpose of the Optional Clause, is that it has intro-
duced into the Declaration a degree of uncertainty as to reciprocal
rights and obligations which deprives the acceptance of the com-
pulsory jurisdiction of the Court of all practical value. In particular,
it was contended that, in consequence of the Third Condition, the
other Signatories are in a continuous state of uncertainty as to
their reciprocal rights and obligations which may change from day
to day.

While it must be admitted that clauses such as the Third Condition
bring about a degree of uncertainty as to the future action of the
accepting government, that uncertainty does not attach to the
position actually established by the Declaration of Acceptance or
as it might be established in consequence of recourse to the Third
Condition.

As Declarations, and their alterations, made under Article 36
must be deposited with the Secretary-General, it follows that, when
a case is submitted to the Court, it is always possible to ascertain
what are, at that moment, the reciprocal obligations of the Parties
in accordance with their respective Declarations. Under the existing
system, Governments can rely upon being informed of any changes
in the Declarations in the same manner as they are informed of
total denunciations of the Declarations. It is true that during the
interval between the date of a notification to the Secretary-General
and its receipt bv the Parties to the Statute, there may exist
some element of uncertainty. However, such uncertainty is inherent
in the operation of the system of the Optional Clause and does not
affect the validity of the Third Condition contained inthe Portu-
guese Declaration.

It must also be noted that, with regard to any degree of uncer-
tainty resulting from the right of Portugal to avail itself at any time
of its Third Condition of Acceptance, the position is substantially
the same as that created by the right claimed by many Signatories
of the Optional Clause, including India, to terminate their Decla-
rations of Acceptance by simple notification without any obligatory
period of notice. India did so on January 7th, 1956, when it notified
the Secretary-General of the denunciation of its previous Decla-
ration of Acceptance, for which it simultaneously substituted a
new Declaration incorporating reservations which were absent
from its previous Declaration. By substituting, on January 7th,
1956, a new Declaration for its earlier Declaration, India achieved,
in substance, the object of Portugal’s Third Condition.

It has been argued that there is a substantial difference, in the
matter of the certainty of the legal situation, between the Third
Portuguese Condition and the right of denunciation without notice.



In the view of the Court there is no essential difference, with regard to
the degree of certainty, between a situation resulting from the right
of total denunciation and that resulting from the Third Portuguese
Condition which leaves open the possibility of a partial denunciation
of the otherwise subsisting original Declaration.

Neither can it be admitted, as a relevant differentiating factor,
that while in the case of total denunciation the denouncing State
can no longer invoke any rights accruing under its Declaration, in
the case of a partial denunciation under the terms of the Third
Condition Portugal can otherwise continue to claim the benefits
of its Acceptance. For, as the result of the operation of reciprocity,
any jurisdictional rights which it may thus continue to claim for
itself can be invoked against it by the other Signatories, including
India.

Finally, as the third reason for the invalidity of the Third
Condition, it has been contended that that Condition offends against.
the basic principle of reciprocity underlying the Optional Clause
inasmuch as it claims for Portugal a right which in effect is denied
to other Signatories who have made a Declaration without append-
ing any such condition. The Court is unable to accept that conten-
tion. It is clear that any reservation notified by Portugal in pursuance
of its Third Condition becomes automatically operative against
it in relation to other Signatories of the Optional Clause. If the
position of the Parties as regards the exercise of their rights is in
any way affected by the unavoidable interval between the receipt
by the Secretary-General of the appropriate notification and its
receipt by the other Signatories, that delay operates equally in
favour of or against all Signatories and is a consequence of the
svstem established by the Optional Clause.

Neither can the Court accept the view that the Third Condition
is inconsistent with the principle of reciprocity inasmuch as it
"renders inoperative that part of paragraph 2 of Article 36, which
refers to Declarations of Acceptance of the Optional Clause in
relation to States accepting the ‘same obligation’. It is not neces-
sary that the “same obligation” should be irrevocably defined at
the time of the deposit of the Declaration of Acceptance for the
entire period of its duration. That expression means no more than
that, as between States adhering to the Optional Clause, each and
all of them are bound by such identical obligations as may exist at
anv time during which the Acceptance is mutually binding.

As the Court finds that the Third Portuguese Condition is not
inconsistent with the Statute, it is not necessary for it to consider
the question whether, if it were invalid, its invalidity would affect
the Declaration as a whole.

For these reasons, the First Preliminary Objection of the Govern-
ment of India must be dismissed.


The Second Preliminary Objection of the Government of India
is based on the allegation that—as the Portuguese Application of
December 22nd, 1955, was filed before the lapse of such brief period
as in the normal course of events would have enabled the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, in compliance with Article 36,
paragraph 4, of the Statute of the Court, to transmit copies of the
Portuguese Declaration of Acceptance of December 19th, 1055, to
the other Parties to the Statute—the filing of the Application violated
the equality, mutuality and reciprocity to which India was entitled
under the Optional Clause and under the express condition of
reciprocity contained in its Declaration of February 28th, 1940;
that, in consequence, the conditions necessary to entitle the
Government of Portngal to invoke the Optional Clause against
India did not exist when that Application was filed; and that, as
a result, the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the
Application.

The principle of reciprocity forms part of the system of the
Optional Clause by virtue of the express terms both of Article 36
of the Statute and of most Declarations of Acceptance, including
that of India. The Court has repeatedly affirmed and applied that
principle in relation to its own jurisdiction. It did so, in particular,
in the case of Certain Norwegian Loans (I.C.J. Reports 1957,
pp. 22-24) where it recalled its previous practice on the subject.
However, it is clear that the notions of reciprocity and equality are
not abstract conceptions. They must be related to some provision
of the Statute or of the Declarations.

The two questions which the Court must now consider are as
follows: in filing its Application on the date that it did, namely,
December 22nd, 1955, did Portugal act in a manner contrary to
any provision of the Statute? If not, did it thereby violate any right
of India under the Statute or under its Declaration?

In the course of the oral argument the Government of India
disclaimed any intention of contending that Portugal was not
entitled to file its Application until the notification of the Secretary-
General had reached the Government of India. The latter merely
maintained that before filing its Application Portugal ought to
have allowed such period to elapse as would reasonably have
permitted the notification of the Secretary-General to take its
“appropriate effects’.

The material dates, as stated by the Government of India, are
as follows: On December 19th, 1955, the Representative of Portugal
to the United Nations made the Declaration, on behalf of the
Government of Portugal, accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of



the Court under the Optional Clause. On December 22nd, the
Government of Portugal filed in the Court the Application insti-
tuting the present proceedings against the Government of India.
On the same day, a telegram was sent by the Court notifying the
Government of India of the filing of the Portuguese Application.
On December 30th, 1955, the Government of India received a copy
of the Portuguese Declaration of Acceptance which had been
obtained from the Court by its Embassy at The Hague. On fanu-
ary 19th, 1956, a copy of the Portuguese Declaration was officially
transmitted to the Government of India by the Secretary-General
of the United Nations in compliance with Article 36, paragraph 4,
of the Statute.

The Government of India has contended that, in filing its Appli-
cation on December 22nd, 1955, the Government of Portugal did
not act in conformity with the provisions of the Statute. The
Court is unable to accept that contention. The Court considers
that, by the deposit of its Declaration of Acceptance with the
Secretary-General, the accepting State becomes a Party to the
system of the Optional Clause in relation to the other declarant
States, with all the rights and obligations deriving from Article 36.
The contractual relation between the Parties and the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court resulting therefrom are established, “ipso
facto and without special agreement”, by the fact of the making
of the Declaration. Accordingly, every State which makes a Decla-
ration of Acceptance must be deemed to take into account the
possibility that, under the Statute, it may at any time find itself
subjected to the obligations of the Optional Clause in relation to a
new Signatory as the result of the deposit by that Signatory of a
Declaration of Acceptance. A State accepting the jurisdiction of
the Court must expect that an Application may be filed against it
before the Court by a new declarant State on the same day on
which that State deposits with the Secretary-General its Declara-
tion of Acceptance. For it is on that very day that the consensual
bond, which is the basis of the Optional Clause, comes into being
between the States concerned. When India made its Declaration of
Acceptance of February 28th, 1940, it stated that it accepted the
jurisdiction of the Court for a specified period ‘‘from to-day’s date”.

It has been contended by the Government of India that as
Article 36 requires not only the deposit of the Declaration of
Acceptance with the Secretary-General but also the transmission
by the Secretary-General of a copy of the Declaration to the Parties
to the Statute, the Declaration of Acceptance does not become
effective until the latter obligation has been discharged. However,
it is only the first of these requirements that concerns the State
making the Declaration. The latter is not concerned with the duty
of the Secretary-General or the manner of its fulfilment. The legal
effect of a Declaration does not depend upon subsequent action or
inaction of the Secretary-General. Moreover, unlike some other



instruments, Article 36 provides for no additional requirement, for
instance, that the information transmitted by the Secretary-General
must reach the Parties to the Statute, or that some period must
elapse subsequent to the deposit of the Declaration before it can
become effective. Any such requirement would introduce an ele-
ment of uncertainty into the operation of the Optional Clause
system. The Court cannot read into the Optional Clause any requi-
rement of that nature.

India has further contended that, even though the filing of the
Application by Portugal be held to be otherwise in accordance with
Article 36, it was effected in a manner which violated rights of
India under the Statute and under its Declaration of Acceptance.

Apart from complaining generally of an impairment of its rights
of equality, mutuality and reciprocity under the Statute, India has
not specified what actual right has been adversely affected by the
manner of the filing of the Portuguese Application. The Court has
been unable to discover what right has, in fact, thus been violated.

As the Court has arrived at the conclusion that the manner of
filing the Portuguese Application was neither contrary to Article 36
of the Statute nor in violation of any right of India under the
Statute, or under its Declaration of Acceptance, the Court must
dismiss the Second Preliminary Objection of the Government of
India.


As the Second and Fourth Preliminary Objections are concerned
with cognate aspects of the filing of the Portuguese Application,
it is convenient to consider the Fourth Preliminary Objection
before examining the Third.

In the Fourth Preliminary Objection, India contended that,
since it had no knowledge of the Portuguese Declaration before
Portugal filed its Application, it was unable to avail itself, on
the basis of reciprocity, of the Third Portuguese Condition and
to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Court the dispute which
is the subject-matter of the Portuguese Application. This Objection
is based on considerations substantially identical with those
adduced in support of the Second Preliminary Objection. Accord-
ingly, the Court will confine itself to recalling what it has already
said in dealing with the Second Preliminary Objection, in particular
that the Statute does not prescribe any interval between the
deposit by a State of its Declaration of Acceptance and the filing
of an Application by that State, and that the principle of reciprocity
is not affected by any delay in the receipt of copies of the Decla-
ration by the Parties to the Statute.

As the manner of the filing of the Portuguese Application did
not in respect of the Third Portuguese Condition deprive India



of any right of reciprocity under Article 36 of the Statute, so
as to constitute an abuse of the Optional Clause, the Court cannot
regard the Fourth Preliminary Objection of the Government of
India as well founded.


In its Third Preliminary Objection, as defined in the Submis-
sions, the Government of India contended that, as the Portuguese
Application of December 22nd, 1955, was filed before the Por-
tuguese claim was effectively made the subject of diplomatic
negotiations, the subject-matter of the claim had not yet been
determined and that there was therefore, as yet, no legal and
justiciable dispute between the Parties which could be referred
to the Court under the Optional Clause. It was therefore submitted
that, as the conditions necessary to entitle the Government of
Portugal to invoke the Optional Clause did not exist at the time
of the Application, the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain
the Application.

In particular, the Third Objection is based on the allegation
that, although neither Article 36 (2) of the Statute nor the Por-
tuguese or Indian Declarations of Acceptance refer directly to
the requirement of previous negotiations, the fact that the Appli-
cation was filed prior to the exhaustion of diplomatic negotiations
was contrary to Article 36 (2) of the Statute, which refers to
legal disputes. It was contended by India that, unless negotiations
had taken place which had resulted in a definition of the dispute
between the Parties as a legal dispute, there was no dispute, in
the sense of Article 36 (2) of the Statute, the existence of which
had been established in the Application and with respect to which
the Court could exercise jurisdiction.

In examining this Objection, the Court must consider the
question of the extent to which, prior to the filing of the Application
by Portugal, negotiations had taken place between the Parties in
the matter of the right of passage. An examination of these
negotiations shows that, although they cover various aspects of
the situation arising out of the political claims of India in respect
of the enclaves, a substantial part of these exchanges of views
was devoted, directly or indirectly, to the question of access to
the enclaves. À survey of the correspondence and Notes laid
before the Court reveals that the alleged denial of the facilities
of transit to the enclaves provided the subject-matter of repeated
complaints on the part of Portugal; that these complaints consti-
tuted one of the principal objects of such exchanges of views as
took place; that, although the exchanges between the Parties
had not assumed the character of a controversy as to the nature



and extent of the legal right of passage, Portugal described the
denial of passage requested by it as being inconsistent not only
with requirements of good neighbourly relations but also with
established custom and international law in general; and that
these complaints were unsuccessful.

While the diplomatic exchanges which took place between the
two Governments disclose the existence of a dispute between
them on the principal legal issue which is now before the Court,
namely, the question of the right of passage, an examination of
the correspondence shows that the negotiations had reached a
deadlock.

It would therefore appear that assuming that there is substance
in the contention that Article 36 (2) of the Statute, bv referring
to legal disputes, establishes as a condition of the jurisdiction
of the Court a requisite definition of the dispute through nego-
tiations, the condition was complied with to the extent permitted
bv the circumstances of the case.

The Court finds that the legal issue was sufficiently disclosed
in the diplomatic exchanges, and considers that the Government
of Portugal has complied with the ‘conditions of the Court’s
jurisdiction as laid down in Article 36 (2) of the Statute. Accord-
ingly, the Court must dismiss the Third Preliminary Objection.


In its Fifth Preliminary Objecticn the Government of India
has relied on the reservation which forms part of its Declaration
of Acceptance of February 2Sth, 1940, and which excludes from
the jurisdiction of the Court disputes with regard to questions
which by international law fall exclusively within the jurisdiction
of the Government of India. In particular, it was asserted by the
Government of India that the facts and the legal considerations
adduced before the Court did not permit the conclusion that
there was a reasonably arguable case for the contention that the
subject-matter of the dispute is outside the exclusive domestic
jurisdiction of India. It was therefore submitted that the dispute
is outside the jurisdiction of the Court.

The relevant Submissions of the Government of India filed on
September 27th, 1957, are based largely on the following assertions:
in paragraph (a) of its Submissions on the Fifth Objection it is
asserted that “the Portuguese claim to a right of transit … cannot
be regarded as a reasonably arguable cause of action under inter-
national law unless it is based on the express grant or specific
consent of the territorial sovereign”, and that “the facts presented
to the Court in the Pleadings of the Parties show no such express
grant or specific consent of the territorial sovereign as could place



a limitation on the exercise of India’s jurisdiction...”. In para-
graph (à) it is asserted that none of the grounds put forward by
the Government of Portugal, namely, treaty, custom and general
principles of law, can be regarded on the facts and the law which
have been presented to the Court as reasonably arguable under
international law. Paragraph (c) deals exclusively with factual
aspects of the matter before the Court. India urges that the Fifth
Preliminary Objection must be sustained for the reason that
“regardless of the correctness or otherwise of the conclusions set
out in paragraphs 4 (a) and 4 (b), the uncontradicted facts presented
in the Pleadings of the Parties establish that the question of
transit between Daman and the enclaves has always been dealt
with both by Portugal and the territorial sovereign on the basis
that it is a question within the exclusive competence of the terri-
torial sovereign”. Finally, in paragraph (d) it is urged that the
dispute submitted to the Court by Portugal is not a legal dispute
which may be decided by the Court under Article 38, paragraph 1,
of the Statute.

The facts on which those Submissions of the Government of
India are based are not admitted by Portugal. The elucidation
of those facts, and their legal consequences, involves an examination
of the actual practice of the British, Indian and Portuguese
authorities in the matter of the right of passage—-in particular
as to the extent to which that practice can be interpreted, and
was interpreted by thie Parties, as signifying that the right of
passage is a question which according to international law is
exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of the territorial
sovereign. There is the further question as to the legal significance
of the practice followed by the British and Portuguese authorities,
namely, whether that practice was expressive of the common
agreement of the Parties as to the exclusiveness of the rights of
domestic jurisdiction or whether it provided a basis for a resulting
legal right in favour of Portugal. There is, again, the question
of the legal effect and of the circumstances surrounding the
application of Article 17 of the Treaty of 1779 and of the Mahratha
Decrees issued in pursuance thereof.

Having regard to all these and similar questions, it is not possible
to pronounce upon the Fifth Preliminarv Objection at this stage
without prejudging the merits. Accordingly, the Court decides to
join that Objection to the merits.

In these circumstances, it is not necessary for the Court to
examine the other questions relating to the Fifth Objection which
have been raised by the Parties in their Submissions.


In its Sixth Objection the Government of India contended that
the Court is without jurisdiction on the ground that India’s
Declaration of February 28th, 1949, accepting the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court is limited to ‘‘disputes arising after
February sth, 1030, with regard to situations or facts subsequent
to the same date”. In particular, the Government of India
maintained: (a) that the dispute submitted to the Court by
Portugal is a dispute which did not arise after February sth,
1930, and /b) that in any case it is a dispute with regard to situa-
tions and facts prior to that date.

The Court must examine the relevant Indian reservation, in
the first instance, in so far as it refers fo the date on which the
dispute may be said to have arisen. The first contention advanced
in this connection by the Government of India is that the dispute
submitted to the Court did not arise after February 5th, 1930,
but—partlv or wholly-—before that date. However, the Govern-
ment of Portugal contends that the dispute submitted to the
Court arose after 1953, when the Government of India adopted
certain measures relating to passage and transit between the
littoral territory of Daman and the enclaves of Dadra and Nagar-
Aveli.

That divergence of views cannot be separated from the question
whether or not the dispute submitted to the Court is only a
continuation of a dispute which divided Portugal and the territorial
sovereign prior to 1930 concerning the right of passage. The Court,
having heard conflicting argnments regarding the nature of the
passage formerly exercised, is not in a position to determine
at this stage the date on which the dispute arose or whether or
not the dispute constitutes an extension of a prior dispute.

Similar considerations apply to the second element of the reser-
vation ratione temporis which forms part of the Indian Declaration
of Acceptance, namely, in so far as it refers to “situations or facts”
subsequent to 5th February, 1930.

It was contended that the question of the existence or non-existence
of a legal right of passage was not, prior to 1930, in controversy
between the Parties concerned and that they managed throughout
. to settle, without raising or resolving the question of legal right,
the practical problems arising in this connection. On the other
hand it was also contended that the dispute now before the Court
is a continuation of a conflict of views going as far as 1818, and
that it is a dispute “beyond anv question with reference to situa-
tions or facts stretching far back before 1930”.



The Court is not at present in possession of sufficient evidence
to enable it to pronounce on these questions. To do that would
necessitate an examination and clarification of, often complicated,
questions of fact bearing on the practice pursued by the authorities
concerned for a period of very considerable duration and stretching
back to 1818, or even 1779. There are other factors which give rise
to similar considerations. These factors include the disputed inter-
pretation of the Treaty of 1779 between the Mahrathas and the
Portuguese. Any evaluation of these factors, although limited to
the purposes of the Sixth Preliminary Objection, would entail the
risk of prejudging some of the issues closely connected with the
merits. Accordingly, the Court must join the Sixth Preliminary
Objection to the merits.

THE COURT,
by fourteen votes to three,
rejects the First Preliminary Objection;
by fourteen votes to three,
rejects the Second Preliminary Objection;
by sixteen votes to one,
rejects the Third Preliminary Objection;
