Since we find ourselves unable to concur in the decision of the
Court, it is necessary that we should state the reasons for our
dissent.

The case is one of special importance. It involves not only a
fundamental question of judicial approach; it is as well one which
presents quite exceptional difficulties—a fact reflected by the
narrow majority on which the decision rests.

These difficulties are not merely technical, though these exist.
They spring rather from the fact that the case belongs to a type
the outcome of which is liable to be dominated, or at least strongly
influenced, by the character of the initial approach to it.

In order to assume jurisdiction, the Court had not only to reject
all the objections formally presented by the Respondent but also
certain others. These we shall mention in due course.

The Court has, in our opinion, only been able do this by adopting
premises which, as will emerge from what we have to say, largely
- assume beforehand the correctness of the conclusions arrived at.

We have felt unable to adopt this approach. In our opinion, the
only correct method of procedure is to begin by an examination
of the legal elements, with especial reference, where questions of
interpretation are concerned, to the actual language employed,
and then, on the basis of this examination, to consider what are
the correct conclusions which, as a matter of law, should be drawn
from them. It is in this spirit that we have approached our task.

We are not unmindful of, nor are we insensible to, the various
considerations of a non-juridical character, social, humanitarian
and other, which underlie this case; but these are matters for the
political rather than for the legal arena. They cannot be allowed to
deflect us from our duty of reaching a conclusion strictly on the basis
of what we believe to be the correct legal view. They do however
lead us to draw attention to another aspect of the matter.

A Court called upon to consider objections to its jurisdiction
must exclude from consideration all questions relating to the
merits of the dispute, unless the jurisdictional issues are so inter-
twined with the merits that they cannot be considered separately,
and must be joined to the merits. It is nevertheless legitimate
for a Court, in considering the jurisdictional aspects of any case,
to take into account a factor which is fundamental to the jurisdic-
tion of any tribunal, namely whether the issues arising on the merits
are such as to be capable of objective legal determination.

1. The principle of consent as the essential condition for
founding international jurisdiction. Such consent may be given
generally, in advance, or ad hoc, and may in a proper case be
held to have been given. But that it was in fact given, and that
it covers the actual case before the Court, must be objectively
demonstrated, and cannot simply be presumed.

2. The principle that rights conferred on or vested in persons
or entities in a specified capacity, or as members of a specified



class, are not conferred on or vested in them in their personal
or individual capacity, and therefore cease to be available to
them if they lose the specified capactiy, or cease to be members
of the indicated class; and are equally not available to them in a
different capacity, or as members of another class.

3. The principle that provisions are prima facie to be inter-
preted and applied according to their terms, where these are
clear and unambiguous in their expression of the intention of
the parties, and that such terms can only be ignored or overridden
(if at all) on the basis of some demonstrably applicable legal
principle of superior authority. The principle of interpreta-
tion directed to giving provisions their maximum effect cannot
legitimately be employed in order to introduce what would
amount to a revision of those provisions.

4. The principle that a Court of law cannot correct the past
errors or omissions of the parties, and that it is not the province
of a Court to place some of the parties in the same position as they
would have been in if they had taken action they could have
taken, but did not take, and even deliberately avoided taking.

In our opinion, the judgment of the Court fails to give expression
to these principles, either ignoring them or advancing no adequate
grounds for departing from them—as in our view it clearly does.
In the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition there is a well-known saying
that “hard cases make bad law”, which might be paraphrased
to the effect that the end however good in itself does not justify the
means, where the means, considered as legal means, are of such
a character as to be inadmissible.

It is because of the foregoing considerations, and as Members of
a Court whose task it is under Article 38, paragraph 1, of its Statute,
“to decide in accordance with international law’’, that we are
unable to accept the reasoning on which the Judgment of Court is
based.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED

Although the issues now involved are stated in the Judgment,
their real character is not we think sufficiently brought out there,
and we propose briefly to re-state them in our own way.

The jurisdiction of the Court is fundamentally derived from
Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, which en-



ables the Court to hear any cases referred to it by the parties
[ie. jointly] or any cases “specially provided for ... in treaties or
conventions in force”. But whether in any particular case that
jurisdiction can be exercised compulsorily depends on factors lying
outside this provision—for instance the existence of a Declaration
under paragraph 2 of Article 36 (the “Optional Clause”) or the terms
of a provision for compulsory adjudication by the Court contained
in some treaty or convention in force. It is for this reason that the

character, is that the original forum for the settlement of disputes
arising under Article 7 of the Mandate was the predecessor of the
present Court, the former Permanent Court of International Justice,
which ceased to exist in 1946. This latter Court was equally the
forum specified in the adjudication clauses of many other inter-
national instruments. In our view, the effect of Article 37 of the
Statute of the present Court—and its sole relevant effect in the
context of this case—was (as between the parties to the Statute)
to substitute the present Court for the former Permanent Court in
all cases in which under a “treaty or convention in force”, the Per-
manent Court would have had jurisdiction and would have been
competent to hear and determine the case. Its relevant portions
read as follows:

“Whenever a treaty or convention in force provides for reference
of a matter to ... the Permanent Court of International Justice, the



THE ADVISORY OPINION GIVEN BY THE COURT IN I950

.We are most reluctant to devote any space to the 1950 Opinion,
as we shall call it !. We believe that Opinion was wrong in one or
two important aspects, but by no means in all. But this belief
has not affected our views in the present case, because we think
that different issues are now involved. We are compelled to make
this clear because, in the first place, the Judgment of the Court is
partly founded on the 1950 Opinion ; and secondly, the relevance of
that Opinion was much debated in the arguments of the Parties to
the present proceedings. The Applicants maintained both that the
1950 Opinion was correct in all respects and that (though not on
any basis of res judicata) it completely and automatically governed
the issues arising in the present proceedings. The Respondent State

divisible into three parts: that which deals with Articles 2 to 5 of the Mandate,
that which deals with Article 6, and that which deals with Article 7. Its reasoning
on each of these two latter articles appears to rest upon quite separate and
distinct grounds.



denied this and also adduced material claimed to be new and such
as, had it been available in 1950, would have caused the Court to
find differently. The Applicants, in reply, denied both that the ma-
terial was new, or that it would have had any influence on the views

2. Was the Mandate a treaty or convention?
(a) Legal nature of a treaty or convention

Before considering the character of the Mandate, which will
involve stating, as briefly as we can, the salient features of the pro-
cess by which it was brought into being, there are some preliminary
points of law that must be referred to.

We do not adopt a narrow or doctrinaire view as to what is com-
prised by the term “treaty or convention”. We are not—or at least
so we hope—guilty of the solecisms either of supposing that treaties
or conventions are only what are actually labelled as such, or of



confusing an international agreement as an act, with the particular
instrument in which it is embodied. We give the widest connotation
to the notion of treaty or convention as covering everything: that
constitutes or embodies an international agreement, whatever its
form, style or nomenclature—any agreement, formal or informal.

But while international law takes, and rightly takes, a liberal
view of what constitutes a treaty, convention or other form of
international agreement, the notion is not an unlimited one. It is
not synonymous, as the Judgment of the Court might almost lead
one to suppose, with international acts and instruments generally.
Thus, in its final draft on the “Conclusion, Entry into Force and
Registration of Treaties” completed earlier this year (Document
A/CN. 4/148 of 3 July 1962), the International Law Commission
of the United Nations adopted the following definition of a treaty,
with which we associate ourselves:

“ ‘Treaty’ means any international agreement in written form,
whether embodied in a single instrument or in-two or more related
instruments and whatever its particular designation [here follows a
list of some dozen possible appellations including of course ‘con-
vention’, ‘agreement’ and ‘declaration’], concluded between two or
more States or other subjects of international law and governed
by international law.”

It will be seen that this concept of what constitutes a treaty,
though wide, is not a limitless one. We draw attention in particular,
in the context, to the phrases “in written form” and “concluded
between two or more States or other subjects of international
law”!. Thus a verbal agreement, while it might be held binding
(see the Ihlen Declaration in the Eastern Greenland case, P.C.1.J.

1 À subsidiary point, which we accordingly place in a footnote, is that if, contrary
to our view, the Mandate for South West Africa would otherwise have been in the
nature of a treaty or convention, an objection to this conclusion could be based
on the character of the parties to the Mandate agreement (if it was one). As we
shall demonstrate later, the only entity other than the Mandatory itself which
could have ranked as a party would have been the League of Nations or the Council
of the League acting for it. But it is by no means certain that in 1920 (when the
Mandate was formulated) international legal opinion would have accepted the
conclusion arrived at by the present Court in the Injuries to United Nations Servants
case (Reports 1949, p. 174) that international organizations could have a legal
personality separate and distinct from that of their Members, and rank as entities
“subjects of international law’’. If not, then, considered in the light of contempo-
raneous legal thinking, the Mandate could only have ranked as a treaty or conven-
tion if the parties to it were States. Our view is that the only State which could have
been a party to the Mandate, if it was a treaty or convention, was the Mandatory,
and this would mean (on the above premises) that the Mandate was not a treaty
or convention at all, because not concluded between ‘‘two or more States”. We
deal with this further later.

(c) The framing of the Mandate for South West Africa

The initial steps (we shall not go into a lot of back history)
leading to the issuing or promulgation of the Mandate for South
West Africa were as follows:

I. The various Mandatories for the ex-German territories in
Africa and the Pacific were nominated by the five Principal Allied
and Associated Powers of the First World War, the United States
of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan (hereafter
sometimes called the “Principal Powers”), in whose favour sover-
eignty over these territories was renounced by Germany under
Article 11g of the Treaty of Versailles. It was basically they who
decided to deal with these territories by placing them under Man-
date as a sacred trust for civilization?, though the System itself,
as has been seen, was the creation of Article 22 of the League
Covenant.

2. The actual transfer of the territories to the various Manda-
tories, in their capacity as such, was provided for by Article 257
of the Treaty of Versailles; but already before that Treaty was
signed on June 28, 1919, a decision of the Supreme War Council,
made and published by it early in May of that year, had designated
the various Mandatories, and amongst them the Union of South
Africa in respect of South West Africa ; in point of fact the Respon-
dent accepted the Mandate the same month. This decision of the
Supreme War Council was confirmed in August of the same year.
But even before that, most of the mandated territories (including
South West Africa) were being administered by the future manda-
tories on a basis of military occupation resulting from the operations
of the War. This point was stressed by Lord Balfour in the Council
of the League when he subsequently said ‘Remember that a
Mandate is a self-imposed limitation by the conquerors [of rights]

! For this reason, and as having taken the cession from Germany, it may be
that, in that capacity, though not (as will be seen) as parties to the Mandates,
the Principal Powers retained, and may still retain on a dormant basis, a residual
or reversionary interest in the actual territories concerned except where these
have attained self government or independence.



which they obtained over conquered territories. It is imposed by
the Allied and Associated Powers themselves in the interests oi
what they conceive [to be] the general welfare of mankind; and they
have asked the League of Nations to assist them in seeing that this
policy should be carried into effect.” While not necessarily sub-
scribing to all the legal implications of this statement, it clearly
tends to support the view that a strict rather than a liberal inter-
pretation should be placed on the consent given by the Mandatory
under Article 7.

3. The Treaty of Versailles (and with it the League Covenant
which formed part of it) came into force on January 10, 1920, and
it was therefore not until then that, by virtue of Article 257,
the actual transfer of the mandated territories to the Mandatories,
in their capacity as such, formally took effect. On the same date,
the Mandates System came into being under Article 22 of the Cove-
nant; but the actual Mandates did not appear until much later—
in the case of South West Africa, not until December 17, 1920. It
will thus be seen that, considerably before the formal creation of
the Mandates System, and still more before the terms of the actual
Mandates were settled, the various Mandatories were in fact admi-
nistering the Mandated territories (in practice as Mandatories)
on a guas: anticipatory basis.

*

The situation above described goes far, we consider, to explaining
why the eventual Mandates did not take the form of ordinary
treaties. The League of Nations as an entity was clearly closely
concerned, yet its treaty making capacity was at that time doubtful,
and would certainly have been doubted. How then could the League
be brought in, in a manner that would not involve any question of
its treaty making capacity? It may in any case well have been
considered that the sudden emergence of treaties, with signatures and
ratifications and provisions for coming into force (and who precisely
would sign, and upon what would coming into force have depended?)
more than eighteen months after the Mandatories had de facto started
to function as such, would be inappropriate, and might well give rise
to legal difficulties.

There is nevertheless evidence in the record that it had originally
been intended to create the Mandates by treaty, but this intention
was abandoned for reasons which are obscure, though they can
be guessed at. We do not however draw from this circumstance
the conclusion apparently drawn by some, that the Mandate should

548.



nevertheless still be deemed to be what it may originally have been
intended to be—a treaty. We draw the opposite conclusion, that
in the final result it was not intended to be a treaty, or the original
intention would have been proceeded with. No other conclusion
can well be come to on any permissible process of interpretation.

As it is impossible for us within reasonable limits of space to go
over all the documentation, we propose to concentrate on one or
two salient matters. The first of these consists of a report by the
Belgian representative on the Council of the League (M. Hymans)
which was adopted unanimously by the Council on August 5,
1920. This report contained a detailed consideration of the problems
associated with the creation of the Mandates System, with a view
to securing the performance of Article 22 of the Covenant, and
it is of special importance. It stated (inier alia) that Article 22 laid
down two essential principles which applied to all peoples not able
to stand by themselves, namely:

(1) it was the sacred trust of civilization to assure the well-
being and development of these peoples;

(2) certain guarantees were stipulated to ensure the performance
of this trust, namely:

(a) the tutelage of such peoples was to be entrusted to the na-
tions best fitted to undertake this responsibility;

(b) such nations were to exercise this tutelage as Mandatories
and on behalf of the League.

Pausing there, it will be noted that amongst these guarantees and
securities (as specified in this Report), there is no mention of any
“Judicial supervision” to be exercised by the Permanent Court
relative to the conduct of the Mandate. We therefore have the
position that in a Report which specifically stated what (in the
unanimous view of the Council, since it was adopted unanimously)
were the securities intended by the Covenant for the performance
of the trust, there was no suggestion of any kind that any additional
security was required or contemplated. In particular, for our pur-
poses, there was no reference in the Report to any necessity for
Judicial determination of disputes relating to the conduct of the
Mandate.

The same Report confirmed that the Principal Allied and Asso-
ciated Powers had already, by a decision published in May 1919,
decided who were to be the Mandatory Powers, and that the terri-
tories concerned were actually already being administered by the
Mandatory Powers to whom it was intended to entrust them.

The Report went on to say that draft treaties had been negotiated
between the Allied Powers principally concerned, but that the
drafts had not been published. (These drafts are to be found in



Foreign Relations of the United States—Paris Peace Conference,
Vol, IX at 649 et seq. They were in the form of formal conventions
between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and the Man-
datory Powers.)

The Report then stated that the right to allocate the Mandates,
i.e. to appoint the Mandatory Powers, and to determine the terri-
tories over which they would exercise authority, belonged to the
Principal Allied and Associated Powers and that this admitted of
no divergence of opinion. As to the degree of authority, control
or administration, the Report suggested that the Principal Allied
and Associated Powers should “at the same time as.they acquaint
us with their decisions as to the Mandatory Powers, inform us of
their proposals with regard to the terms of the Mandate to be
exercised”. We stress the word “proposals”.

The Report then suggested to the Council the following resolu-
tions:

“I. The Council decides to request the Principal Powers to

(a) name the Powers to whom they have decided to allocate
the Mandates provided for in Article 22;

‘(b) to inform it as to the frontiers of the territories to come
under these Mandates;

(ce) to communicate to it the terms and conditions of the
Mandates that they propose should be adopted by the
Council from (sic) following the prescriptions of Article 22
(italics ours).

II. The Council will take cognizance of the Mandatory Powers
appointed and will examine the draft Mandates communicated to
it, in order to ascertain that they conform to the prescription of
Article 22 of the Covenant.

III. The Council will notify to each Power appointed that it is
invested with the Mandate, and will, at the same time, communicate
to it the terms and conditions.”

This Report was adopted by the Council unanimously on Au-
gust 5, 1920, and the suggested resolutions were duly carried.

It was not, however, until December 14, 1920, that a proposed
draft “C” Mandates were placed before the Council of the League.
The United Kingdom representative on that day “handed in a
draft Mandate proposed by the British Government” relating to
South West Africa and other “C” Mandate territories. The Council
referred the drafts to the Secretariat ‘to consider the Mandate
and to consult other legal experts on any points necessary’.
Subject to certain alterations made by the Council of the League—
to which reference is made later—these drafts formed the basis of
the Resolution of the Council of the League of December 17, 1920,
containing the Mandate for South West Africa.

*

The foregoing statement of the facts, in our view makes two
things abundantly clear:

I. Any intention which the Principal Allied and Associated
Powers may at one time have had to confer the Mandates, name
the Mandatory Powers, define the limits of the Mandated territo-
ries, and set out the terms of the Mandates in a formal treaty or
convention between themselves and the Mandatories, was aban-
doned in favour of the procedure set out in the resolution of the
Council of the League of August 5, 1920, namely, action taken by
the Council of the League directly pursuant to Article 22 of the
Covenant.

2. At a certain point, i.e. when it adopted the Resolution of
August 5, 1920, and thereafter, the League Council so to speak
“took charge” of the whole operation, and what it required of the
Powers was that these should communicate to it their proposed
terms for the Mandates, in order that the Council might satisfy
itself that they conformed to Article 22 of the Covenant, and the
Council would then, by its own act, give these terms the force of
law. In short the Mandates were not to take the form of treaties
or conventions between the Principal Powers and the Mandatories:
they were to take the form of a guasi-legislative act of the Council.
As will be seen, this is the form they did take, and this constitutes
the decisive factor regarding this part of the case.

(d) The promulgation of the Mandate

The Mandate for South West Africa, as eventually adopted bv
the Council of the League and promulgated by a Council resolution
of December 17, 1920, had undergone certain alterations as a result
of being referred to the Secretariat and to “other legal experts”
at the stage when it consisted of a draft containing the proposals
of the Principal Powers. These alterations, to which we shall come
presently, were accepted by the Council for the purposes of its
final resolution. They do not affect the substance of the Mandate,
but they do affect in certain highly significant respects the jurisdic-
tional questions under consideration in the present phase of this
case. Their chief significance, however, lies in the fact that they
were made at all, and by the Council acting as such, and as its
own act—so that the Mandate, in its final form, was the act of
an organ of an international organization, in the active exercise
of powers conferred on it by its constitution. It was not a treaty
or convention between States or other international entities and
had not character as such.



We now set out the terms of the Mandate as adopted by the
League Council on December 17, 1920, since it is not in our view
. possible to understand its character without the convenience of
easy reference to it. It read: —

“MANDATE FOR GERMAN SOUTH WEST ArRICA

The Council of the League of Nations :

Whereas by Article 119 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany signed
at Versailles on June 28th, 1919, Germany renounced in favour of
the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her
oversea possessions, including therein German South-West Africa;
and

Whereas tne Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that,
in accordance with Article 22 Part I (Covenant of the League of
Nations) of the said Treaty, a Mandate should be conferred upon
His Britannic Majesty to be exercised on his behalf by the Govern-
ment of the Union of South Africa to administer the territory
aforementioned, and have proposed that the Mandate should be


(a) At what date must it be in force as such?

Since, in our view, the Mandate has not, and never did have the
intrinsic character of an international agreement, it is strictly

. ! We are aware of course that in the case of Mavrommatis (P.C.1.J., Series A/B,
No. 2, at 11) the parties did not dispute that the Palestine Mandate was a treaty
or convention in force. The issue was not contested, objections to jurisdiction were
based on other grounds.



unnecessary to consider whether. it is still in force, regarded as a
“treaty or convention’. Nevertheless we propose to do so, because
. the Mandate, if not itself an international agreement, had certain
aspects on the basis of which it may be argued that it had some
conventional character. This being so, we would not wish to rest our
view on the sole conclusion that it had not—correct though we
believe this conclusion to be.

Furthermore we think it essential to consider whether the
Mandate is still “in force” as a treaty or convention, assuming it
was one, for the following reason. The fact that the issue raised
by the first Preliminary Objection is not whether the Mandate is
simply “in force”, appears to have been completely lost sight of.
The issue arising on Article 37 of the Statute is whether the Mandate
is in force as a treaty or convention. For this purpose it is not suf-
ficient to rely on the Court’s 1950 Opinion as establishing that the
Mandate is, in any case, in force on an institutional basis.

The term “in force” in Article 37 must, we think, be taken to have
the same meaning as in the reference to “treaties and conventions
in force” in Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute, namely in
force at the date when the Court is seized of the case by Applica-
tion, this being the date when all the elements necessary to give
the Court jurisdiction must be present!

(b) Who would be the parties to the Mandate as a treaty or conven-
tion in force?

It is, or should be, common ground that, assuming the Mandate
to have been a treaty or convention, there must have been parties
to it, and that it would have ceased to be in force as such on the
disappearance of the parties, and/or the reduction of them to below
the minimum number (of two) requisite for an agreement to be,
and remain, in force as such. We do not accept the view that a
treaty can be “‘partyless”’. The present-day United Nations trus-
teeships have been cited. Whether these are true agreements

1 The suggestion is advanced that assuming the Mandate was a treaty or con-
vention in force prior to the dissolution of the League, Article 37 of the Court’s
Statute would have permitted a State, a Member both of the League and the United
Nations, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court up to the time that the League was
dissolved; that once the Mandate came within the scope of Article 37 it remained
under it, and that accordingly it must be concluded that such States continued
thereafter and until today to enjoy the right to invoke Article 7 of the Mandate.

The premises manifestly do not support the conclusion.

Article 37 of the Statute did not keep in force treaties or conventions in force when
the Statute came into operation. It goes without saying that if at the time when
the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked a treaty or convention has come to an end,
as such, whether by effluxion of time, agreement between the parties, or for any
other reason, such treaty or convention cannot provide the ground upon which
jurisdiction can be based.



(see Articles 81 to 83 and 85 of the Charter) is not a question we are
called upon to or should express an opinion upon; this would
involve an interpretation of the relevant provisions of Chapter XII
of the Charter. But if they are agreements they certainly have
parties. In 1920, however, and under international law as it then
stood, there was no such thing as an international agreement the
parties to which could not readily be identified.

We must therefore consider the question of who were (apart
from the Mandatory itself), and who are now, the parties to the
Mandate considered as a treaty or convention: but we do not
propose to examine obviously untenable propositions such as
that the inhabitants of the mandated territory were directly or
indirectly parties. There remain for consideration the Principal
Allied and Associated Powers, the individual Members of the League
of Nations, and finally the League itself or League Council.

(i) The Principal Allied and Associated Powers—It has been
suggested that the Principal Allied and Associated Powers were
the parties, together with the Mandatory. If such was the case,
these Powers appear to have been totally unaware of it for up-
wards of forty years. It has already been seen that the original
‘idea of casting the Mandate into the form of an ordinary treaty or
convention was abandoned, and in our view no contractual nexus
was established or intended to be established with or between
the Principal Allied and Associated Powers on the basis, or in
consequence, of the Mandate instrument. This is evidenced not
only from the facts antecedent to December 17, 1920, but also
from the text of the Preamble itself, which makes it clear that
the role of the Powers was confined to naming the Mandatory,
and to proposing the terms of the Mandate for the acceptance or
rejection of the Council—terms which the Council in fact modified
before issuing them as its own act. Once the Powers had taken
this action they became functus officio, apart from such residual
or reversionary rights in the mandated territory itself as they
may have retained on a dormant basis. Thenceforward, the action
was the League Council's, and if it resulted in a treaty or conven-
tion at all, it was not one to which the Powers as such and as a
. group were parties; for thenceforward (as provided by the Cove-
nant) the Mandatory exercised the Mandate “on behalf of the
League”, and the Powers disappeared from the scene except as
Members of the Council.

The absence of any contractual nexus so far as the Powers
were concerned, is further evidenced by the fact that, although
the United States of America had participated in the earlier drafting
of the ‘“C’’ Mandates, and in the allocation of the Mandate for South
West Africa to the Respondent State in 1919, it not only was not
present at the Council Meeting of December 17, 1920—since it had



never ratified the Treaty of Versailles or become a Member of the
League—-but was unaware of what had been submitted to the
Council on December 14, 1920, and dealt with by the latter three
days later; or of what action the Council had taken, until after
the event. Moreover we know that in the separate treaty which the
United States concluded with Germany in Berlin in 1927, it re-
served for itself all rights and advantages set out in the Treaty of
Versailles for the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, including
those in respect of the former German colonies, and stipulated that
it should not be bound by any action taken by the League of Na-
tions unless the United States should expressly give its assent to
such action. Whether the United States ever did expressly give
its consent to the terms of the Mandate for South West Africa does
not appear.

ES

The view that the Powers were or regarded themselves as
being parties to the Mandate (or to any of the Mandates) is equally
impossible to reconcile with their subsequent conduct, as also
with certain elements of the legal situation resulting from the
Mandate instrument.

At no time subsequent to December 1920, did any of the Powers
claim to be a separate party, gua Principal Allied Powers, or to
have any interest in the conduct of the Mandate otherwise than
through their membership of the League Council. Such a claim
would also have been hardly consistent, legally, with the fact that
according to paragraph 1 of Article 7 of the Mandate, it could
only be modified with the consent of the League Council (a similar
provision appeared in all the “B” and “C” Mandates).

This situation was no doubt masked by the fact that the Principal
Powers (minus the United States however) were themselves per-
manent members of the League Council which acted by unanimity.
Moreover, it is possible, though not easy, to read paragraph 1 of
Article 7 of the Mandate as not excluding the necessity for other
consents, additionally to the Council’s. Again, it can be contended
that countries may become parties to treaties which they have
agreed shall be subject to modification without their consent, and
that this was in fact the position of the Powers in relation to the
Mandate, because of or under paragraph 1 of Article 7.

These are far-fetched arguments, or hypotheses (speculations
really), and the point is that there is no evidence at all to show
that this was the position, rather than the much more natural
and likely hypothesis that if the Mandate was a treaty, the other

of 12th Session of the Council of the League of Nations.



party to it was the League alone, or the League Council acting
for it. It is quite clear that the Council’s view was that it alone was
the competent authority to modify the terms of a Mandate in-
strument, a view which it is evident the Principal Allied and
Associated Powers on the Council accepted. The Council on many
occasions acted on this view. It seems indisputable that the Prin-
cipal Allied and Associated Powers on the Council accepted the
position that, except in their capacity as Members of the League
Council, their functions had been completed once the Mandates
had been established. There is no evidence to suggest that any of
them ever thought that their consent was essential to any modifica-
tion of a Mandate, or that this was merely because they had waived
their rights in the matter*, .

But whatever may have been the position in the time of the
League of Nations, the view that the Powers were (and still are
now) parties to the Mandate as a treaty or convention, would lead
to even more formidable difficulties to-day, particularly if the
Court’s 1950 finding that the Mandate could be altered by agreement
between the Mandatory and the United Nations was correct--
for in the Assembly of the United Nations the Principal Powers
have no controlling vote or veto, and only three of them are—if
the United States is included—Permanent Members of the Security
Council. One can only conclude that in the absence of express
provisions producing such a result, it is not legallv possible to
entertain the idea that a group of countries can be parties to a
treaty which can be altered without their consent, or even, it would
seem, contrary to their wishes.

Nor is the post-1945 conduct of the Powers consistent, any
more than it ever was, with the view that they, or any of them,
were parties to the various Mandates as treaties or conventions.

! What took place in relation to the Mandate of Iraq is we think informative.

The Mandate was conferred upon the United Kingdom by the Supreme Allied
Council at San Remo on April 25, 1920. The United Kingdom accepted the Mandate.

Thereafter the United Kingdom entered into a series of Treaties between itself
and the King of Iraq. These or most of them were communicated to the Council of
the League. No other State was a party to these Treaties.

In a communication from the United Kingdom of September 27, 1924, to the
Council of the League—and to it alone—these Treaties were summarized and
supplemented by a statement setting out the Mandatory Powers own obligations
to the League, with regard to the application of Article 22 of the Covenant. In this
communication the United Kingdom stated that it was ‘‘willing to agree’ with the
Council upon certain terms which were set out. -

Amongst the undertakings given to the Council and accepted by it was one that
an annual report should be made to the satisfaction of the Council, another to the
effect that no modification of the terms of the Treaties would be agreed to without
the consent of the Council, and an adjudication clause which in general follows
the form of Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Mandate for South West Africa. The
Principal Allied and Associated Powers were as such complete strangers to these
undertakings; which were given to the Council and to it alone.



On that basis what would one make, for instance, of the passage
in the resolution of the League of April 18, 1946, which referred to
the Mandatories’ intentions to continue to discharge their obliga-
tions under the Mandates “until other arrangements have been
agreed to between the United Nations and the respective Mandatory
Powers” (italics ours)?

Again, when various of the mandated territories were brought
under the Trusteeship System of the United Nations, this was
done directly by the Mandatory Power concerned, and at no time
did any of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers claim, as
such, any right to be a State “directly concerned’ with the terms of
trusteeship under Article 79 of the Charter of the United Nations.

The conclusion must be that the notion of the Principal Powers
or any of them being or ever having been parties to the Mandate,
qua treaty or convention, is too artificial and gratuitous to be ac-
cepted. It represents little more than a rather desperate attempt
to produce some entity as a party which is still extant, and can
therefore, together with the Mandatory, be pointed to as keeping
the Mandate in force today as a treaty or convention®. Much the
same applies to the next suggested category of parties, to which
we now address ourselves.

(ii) The individual Members of the League—If the Members of
the League were parties to the Mandate in their capacity as such,
there would be no problem, for the League being dissolved, its
former Members have lost that capacity and could no longer be
parties to the Mandate as Members of the League. The question
is therefore, and must be, if they were parties, were they so in their
individual capacity as separate sovereign States, still extant (as
States) today?

We think this question can only be answered in the negative.
An instrument or “Declaration” (which was the name given to

! A variation of this theme is the view that four only of the Principal Allied and
Associated Powers were parties to the Mandate as a treaty or convention. This
variation omits the United States. This contention is, if anything, more artificial
than the major theme of which it is a variation. Its only merit is that it seeks to
overcome the difficulty created by the fact that the United States, not being a
Member of the League, was not present at the meeting of the Council in December
1920. Otherwise the same criticisms apply to it. The United States had of course
participated in the conferring of the Mandate and in drafting the terms proposed
to the Council.

The contention in any case is quite inconsistent with the recitals to the Council’s
resolution of December 17, 1920, recitals 1 and 2. The Principal Allied and Associated
Powers by definition under the Peace Treaty included the United States. The
United States was distinctly included in the constantly used descriptive phrase
“the Principal Allied and Associated Powers”: see Annex 154 b, Minutes of 12th
Session of Council of the League.



the Council's Resolution of December 17, 1920, embodying the
Mandate) issued by and in the name of the Council as its own act,
could not bring in the Members of the League except in their
capacity as such—a capacity they no longer have. For them to
have become, and still to be, parties to the Mandates, in their
individual statal capacity, independently of their membership of
the League, would have required something in the nature of the or-
dinary processes of separate signatures, ratifications, full powers,
etc. The whole form and method of issue of the Mandate is hostile
to the notion of the individual Members as separate parties to it,
or as having any status in regard to it, other,than as Members of
the League and through their participation in its activities.

But in any case, the notion of the Members as separately and
individually parties, is excluded by the express statement in the
Preamble to the Mandate (fourth recital) that the Members of
the League, not having previously agreed upon the terms of the
Mandate, these were now being defined by the Councilin the exercise
of the power given it to do so in such circumstances by Article 22,
paragraph 8, of the Covenant. Forty or fifty countries cannot
be separate parties to an agreement which specifically recites that
they have not agreed upon its terms. It has been suggested that
the term “Members of the League” in this fourth recital had some
special, limited and restricted meaning, not including the generality
of the Members, and confined, for instance, to the Principal Powers.
If this were correct, then, since it must be assumed that the term
“Member” or “Members” of the League had the same meaning
wherever used in the Mandate, it would follow that the term
“any … Member of the League” as used in Article 7, paragraph 2,
had the same alleged special, limited and restricted meaning as in
the Preamble, and did not therefore include the Applicant States
now claiming under paragraph 2 of Article 7.

But clearly this suggestion is not correct. It was not merely a
question of the Principal Powers giving up the notion of negotiating
the Mandate by treaty or convention. The other Members of the
League were extant, but they were hardly even consulted or asked
to agree. From the Summary Record of a meeting of the Sub-
Committee VI (¢) of the League Assembly, the Committee on whose
business agenda the question of Mandates was placed—a meeting
held as late as December 13, 1920—it appears that the Council
of the League were already considering the draft of “A” Mandates,
and would probably be considering shortly the “B” and “C”
drafts also, yet the Assembly was being kept in the dark on what
was happening. Copies only of the draft “A” Mandates had been
furnished by the Council to the Sub-Committee, but on the strict
understanding that this information was confidential and that it

must not be used. Four days later the Council promulgated the
Mandate for South West Africa.

It is therefore, we think, evident enough that the Council did not
purport to enter into any contractual engagement on behalf of the
individual States which, either at that time were, or at any time
thereafter should become, Members of the League. The Applicants
admitted, and we think correctly admitted, that the Council acted
under the provisions of Article 22 (8) of the Covenant, and not
otherwise. The Council was doing what, in the circumstances, it was
under a duty to do under that Article. It was not we think purport-
ing to enter into any treaty obligation at all, and it certainly was
not purporting to enter into one on behalf of the individual States,
Members of the League.

Indeed, one will look in vain for any authority in the Covenant
by virtue of which the Council could enter into treaty arrangements
so as to make individual States, who were Members of the League,
then or at any subsequent time, parties to a treaty or convention.
The facts equally fail to disclose any authority given by States to the
Council to act for each of them and to enter into a treaty or conven-
tion on their behalf; and it is established that, apart from those
Members of the League, who were also Members of the Council,
all other States were ignorant beforehand of what was contained
in the Mandate.

Action taken by the Council under Article 22 (8) bound the
League and its Members not because any treaty or convention came
into existence, but solely because the League as such, and the States
Members of the League, were bound in advance under the Covenant
by whatever definition. of the degree of authority, control or admini-
stration to be exercised by the Mandatory Power, was made by the
Council acting under Article 22 (8). They were bound by the Mandate,
in so far as that is relevant; but as, and through, being Members of
the League, not as actual parties to the Mandate itself. A further
indication to the same effect, is that in such provisions as Articles 3
and 7, the Mandate refers— not to the “Parties to the present Man-
date”, or to the “Parties to the present Declaration”, but to the
“Members of the League”. It was as Members of the League, and
not as parties to the Mandate, that certain rights were conferred on
them. Indeed, one of the most striking refutations of the view that
the Members of the League were ever regarded as parties to the
Mandate is to be found in the fact, noted earlier, that the League
Council, when it received the draft terms proposed by the Powers,
made an important change in paragraph z of Article 7. It changed
this provision in such a way that instead of all the Members of the
League undertaking the obligation of compulsory adjudication of
disputes, the Mandatory alone undertook it. This appears to have
been done because it was felt— and rightly felt— that an obligation
of this kind could only result from specific consent. But had the



Members of the League been parties to the Mandate, they would
thereby have consented. Clearly they were not considered to be
parties.

Nor could it be contended that, because the Mandate conferred
on the Union of South Africa was to be exercised by it ‘’on behalf of
the League”, this made each State which was a Member of the Lea-
gue, into a separate party to the Mandate instrument as a treatv or
convention.

We conclude that any interest in the Mandate which the Members
of the League possessed, or any part in it as an international act
which they may have had, was solely in their capacity as Members
of the League.

*
* *

(iii) The League or League Council as party—From the foregoing,
the inevitable conclusion must be drawn that, all other candidates
having been eliminated, the only party to the Mandate, apart from
the Mandatory (and if the Mandate was a treaty or convention at all),
was the League itself or the Council acting for it. This is the only
conclusion consistent with the salient facts—namely that the
Mandate was the act of the Council; that the Council defined its
terms; that the Mandate was exercised “on behalf of the League”;
that except for certain specific rights given by particular provisions
of the Mandate to the “Members of the League” (in their capacity
as such, that is), all the obligations of the Mandate were owed to the
League; and that the Mandate could only be modified with the
consent of the whole Council.

The only doubt, to which we alluded earlier, is whether, at that
date, an international organization such as the League, and still
more a particular organ of it, such as the League Council, would
have been regarded as having separate international personality
and treaty-making capacity. This doubt may well have been one of
the considerations which suggested the actual form taken by the
Mandate. But if so, this would merely bear out the conclusion we
came to on the first part of the first preliminary objection, namely
that the Mandate never had treaty character at all—for if all the
entities that might possibly have been parties to it, considered as a
treaty or convention, apart from the Mandatory, have to be elimi-
nated (including the League and its Council), the inescapable con-
clusion is that the Mandate was not (as it certainly was not in form)
an international agreement.


As we suggested earlier, doubts about the treaty-making capacity
of the League and its Council, coupled with the obvious need for
. providing the Council with an unimpeachable standing in the mat-
ter, and the requirements of Article 22 (8) of the Covenant, may
well have been, indeed we believe it was, a factor in the decision to
formulate the Mandate as a Resolution of the Council, rather than
as a treaty or convention between the Principal Allied and Asso-
ciated Powers and the Mandatory.

In no other way could the Council be given its proper place.
Under a treaty or convention, even if it had made provision for the
position of the League and its Council, this position might well have
been impossible to assert, in the last resort, except through and
with the co-operation of the Powers, and of the Mandatory. Such a
situation would have been wholly incompatible with Article 22 of
the Covenant, and with the whole concept of the Mandates System.

These can only be speculations. What is quite clear is that if the
Mandate was a treaty or convention, the parties, and only parties
to it, were the Mandatory and the League or its Council. Since
neither League nor Council exist now, the number of parties is less
than two, and therefore, as a treaty or convention, the Mandate is no
longer in force.

There is, further, the fact of the non-registration of the Mandate
as a treaty or convention under Article 18 of the Covenant. As
previously noticed, this is a strong indication that those concerned
did not regard it as having treaty character. But if it was a treaty
or convention, as the Applicants contend, then its non-registration
as such would raise the question, under Article 18, whether it was
“binding” in its character as a treaty or convention. 1fit were not, the
further question would arise whether a treaty or convention which
is “not binding” is, or can be, “in force”.

*

Conclusion on the first preliminary objection: the conditions
requisite to give the Court jurisdiction under Articles 36 and 37
of its Statute are not fulfilled, inasmuch as the Mandate was the
act of the League Council and is not and never was a “treaty or
convention” (or other form of international agreement); or alter
natively, if it was, it is no longer in force as such, as there would


Since adjudication clauses invariably indicate what are the
entities, or classes of entity, entitled to avail themselves of the
right to call for a reference to adjudication, the basic question
arising on this part of the present case is whether the actual terms
of Article 7 permit the Applicants to invoke it; and if not, on what
legal basis (if any) they can nevertheless claim to do so. These
terms, we would recall, so far as here relevant, are that the Man-
datory agrees to submit to adjudication, disputes with “any other
Member of the League of Nations”.



It is clear that Article 37 of the Statute cannot operate so as to
substitute the present Court for the former Permanent Court
in a case in which that Court could not have had jurisdiction. It does
not operate so as to increase jurisdiction. It merely substitutes
for a reference to the Permanent Court a reference to this Court.
It cannot, and does not, of itself determine whether, in the given case,
that Court would in fact have been competent. We must stress
this point because, evident though it should be, it does not seem
to have been fully appreciated in the present case. A provision
like Article 37, which is not specifically directed to the case of
Mandates, and relates to a very large number of treaties and con-
ventions of all sorts and kinds, is quite neutral as to whether in
any given case an obligation to submit to adjudication does exist.
Whether the obligation exists in any given case, or not, depends on
the adjudication clause alleged to create it (in this case Article 7
of the Mandate)!, which such a provision as Article 37 can neither
add to nor alter. Failing any express provision to that effect, and
there is none, Article 37 could only operate so as to confer on the
present Court the pre-existing competence—whatever that was—
of the Permanent Court, and not so as to confer a different or more
extensive competence. Moreover Article 37 could not of itself
determine whether any competence at all existed.

One may accept unreservedly that the present Court is, within
the'limits of Article 37, substituted to the fullest possible extent
for the former Permanent Court, to exercise any jurisdiction which
that Court could, in its day, have exercized. The question would
still remain in any given case; could the Permanent Court itself have
exercized that jurisdiction? In our view, it could not and would
not have done so under Article 7 of the Mandate, except at
the instance of a Member of the League of Nations—a quality
not attaching to the present Applicants. It is, in our view, so
evident both that the present International Court cannot exercise
a jurisdiction which the former Permanent Court could not, in
its day, have exercized, and that in fact the Permanent Court
could not then have assumed jurisdiction in proceedings brought
against the Mandatory by a non-Member of the League, that little
more should be necessary to be said on this part of the case.

1 It is the scope of the Mandatory’s obligation to submit to adjudication which
is governed by Article 7. An unlimited obligation to submit to adjudication
is almost unheard of. Practically every adjudication clause contains conditions
and limitations of some kind. A very frequent, almost invariable one, is a limitation
as to the class of State or entity which can invoke the clause. In the case of treaties,
the right is normally restricted to the parties to the treaty; and in the case of in-
struments not of a treaty character, framed by or under the auspices of an inter-
national organization, the normal limitation is to States Members of the organi-
zation concerned.



In the present proceedings what the Court has done—in our
view without legal justification—is to consider the matter on the
footing of what jurisdiction the Permanent Court could and would
have exercized if it was still functioning now—that is to say on the
assumption that the League of Nations was duly dissolved in 1946,
but that the Permanent Court had survived and was here and now
sitting and hearing the present case. This is of course to beg the
whole question at issue, and to disregard the fact that Article 37
could do no more than operate so as to give the present Court
jurisdiction in a case in which the Permanent Court would have
had jurisdiction. This necessarily presupposes a case arising at a
time when the Permanent Court wasin existence, for a non-existent
Court can obviously have no jurisdiction at all. If the Permanent
Court was still functioning, there would have been no need to
substitute the present Court for it. If the present Court has been
substituted for the former Court, it is because the latter was and
is not any longer functioning. Hence the jurisdiction which the
present Court “inherits” (so to speak) from the former Court is
the jurisdiction which the former Court actually was empowered
to exercise when it was functioning—that is to say the jurisdiction
which then fell within the scope of its competence. This did not
include proceedings purported to be brought under Article 7
by non-Members of the League, under which category the Applicants
fall.

In our view this is conclusive so far as the Second Preliminary
Objection is concerned, and strictly incontrovertible. Nevertheless,
we will consider the matter on the basis of whether the Permanent
Court, if it had survived the dissolution of the League, and were
here and now sitting, would be competent to hear and determine
the Applications now before the Court.

*
* *

What the Court is called upon to ccnsider in this part of the
case is the claim made on behalf of the Applicant States, that
although they are no longer Members of the League, because
the League itself has been dissolved, nevertheless as former Mem-
bers, that is, as States who were Members at the date of its dissolu-
tion, they should be deemed to have retained, or still to possess,
the right to invoke Article 7.

We propose to begin by considering whether the kind of transfor-
mation or metamorphosis involved by the Applicants’ claim, as
just stated, could possibly be admitted on the actual language of
Article 7, or by any legitimate process of “interpretation” of it.
We shall later consider whether such a transformation could be
postulated on the basis of any process of presumption or implica-
tion derived from circumstances lying outside Article 7 itself, or



on the basis of the application of some general principle of law operat-
ing to effect such transformation.

*

2. The interpretation of Article 7
(a) The actual language of the Article

We shall assume as our starting point something which we shall
demonstrate more fully later, namely that, in the absence of ex-
press provision to the contrary, rights conferred on or exercise-
able by a person or entity in a specified capacity, or as a member of
a specified class, cannot be exercized in another capacity, or as
a member of another class, or continue to be exercized if the speci-
fied capacity is lost or membership of the class ceases.

Thus, rights conferred on State A as a Member of the League,
or simply on “Members of the League” (State A happening to be or
become a Member) were not, and could not be rights conferred
individually on State A as such, which State A could thenceforth
retain indefinetlv, without limitation of time, irrespective of its
relationship to, or of the very existence of the League.

The fundamental issue of principle raised by the second prelimi-
nary objection is therefore: on what grounds, if any, can States
invested with rights as, and only as, members of a class, claim those
rights in their individual capacity (no longer being members of that
class, or that class having ceased to exist), or as members of another
and different class?

Lord McNair (as he now is) was the only Member of the Court in
the 1950 case who specifically considered this issue in that form,
and he, in effect, set aside the class basis of the right conferred
by Article 7, holding that the mention of membership of the League
constituted only a description of the States entitled to exercise the
right, and was not a condition of its exercise. It did not mean
“so long as the League exists and they are Members of it” (I.C.J.
Reports 1950, at p. 159.) In short, his view, to paraphrase it a little,
was that a State must, of necessity, no longer be a member of a
now non-existing organization, but this did not matter so long as
it could still be identified as a State that was invested with the
right when the organization still existed.

+ Even as a matter of ordinary logic, it is clear that rights conferred expressly on
members of a class, as such, are not thereby conferred on them as individuals.



It is, naturally, with diffidence that we feel bound, for reasons
which will appear, to differ from this distinguished Judge. Lord
McNair’s opinion was indeed an attempt, the only one which has
ever been made, to reconcile such a claim as that of the present
Applicants with the actual language of Article 7. But it appears to
us to have overlooked the fact that Article 7 was never intended
to apply to any particular States as States. Nobody knew in 1920
what the exact membership of the League would be, or what it
would remain. This membership might, and did, vary periodically
a good deal. It was a shifting membership. At one time it might
comprise States A, B and C; at another A and B might have dropped
out, and D and E have come in. This kind of thing occurred from time
to time. Article 7 was not intended to apply to any of these States,
A, B, C, D, or E, as such. It was intended to apply to any State
which, at any given moment was—and only if and so long as it
was—a Member of the League. It was not intended to apply other-
wise. Therefore, if Article 7 conferred a right on Ethiopia and
Liberia, the present Applicants, it was solely as a consequence of
the fact that they happened to fulfil the criterion specified, namely
membership of the League. Otherwise they would not have had
this right.

Consequently there can, in our opinion, be no doubt at all that
during the lifetime of the League, membership was a condition,
and that the Permanent Court would have held itself incompetent
to adjudicate in the case of a dispute between the Mandatory and
a non-Member. An analogy is afforded by the fact that when
Germany, before she became a Member of the League, claimed (as
a Party to the Treaty of Versailles in which the Covenant and
Article 22 were embodied) to be entitled to intervene about the
administration of a former German territory under Belgian Mandate,
the German complaints were not answered by the League Council,
and Belgium as Mandatory stated that all such matters were “within
the exclusive competence of the League of Nations” *.

Similarly, we entertain no doubt, and we do not think there
can be any doubt, that a country such as, for instance, Brazil,
which was a Member of the League at first, but subsequently left
it, thereupon lost its rights under Article 7, and that the Permanent
Court would have declared itself incompetent in any proceedings
brought by Brazil under that provision.

What then would be the difference in principle between such a
case as Brazil’s and that of the Applicant States in these proceed-
ings? It may be suggested that a difference arises out of the different

! League of Nations Official Journal, VIII, pp. 316-317.


manner in which League membership was terminated. Strictly
speaking, of course, the particular reason why the specified capacity,
or membership of the specified class is lost, is quite irrelevant. The
fact alone suffices. However, we will deal with the point. Brazil, it
may be said, voluntarily and deliberately left the League, and there-
fore obviously could not continue to enjoy the same rights as before;
whereas the Applicant States did not renounce their membership
—they lost it. The League came to an end, and therefore they
necessarily ceased to be members of it. But it has to be asked, why
did the League come to an end? It did not simply lapse. The-answer
is, of course, that it came to an end by the act of the Applicants
themselves in joining with the other Members of the League to
dissolve it. Even if it had been the case that the League came to
an end for reasons quite outside its Members’ control, and contrary
to their will, the fact of the cessation of the status and capacity of
League membership would have remained. But even this is not the
case. Termination was the act of the Members of the League them-
selves. Moreover, although, as the Record shows, the case of the
mandated territories was" fully considered both.at San Francisco
when the United Nations was founded, and at Geneva when the
League was dissolved, no provision was made to meet the type of
case which has now arisen. For reasons which will appear later,
we reject the view either that this was due to a mere oversight, or
that such provision was in fact implicitly made in the course of the
final debates at Geneva and by the League resolution concerning
mandated territories of April 18, 1946.

It seems to us, therefore, that the action of the Applicant States
in joining to bring about the cessation of their League membership
was fully as voluntary and deliberate as Brazil's; and we can only
see a difference of method between the two cases. We consider that
the Applicants, by divesting themselves of their League member-
ship, without making provision for the position thus created in
relation to Article 7 of the Mandate, put an end to their rights under
that provision, just as completely as Brazil did.

Even if the matter is placed on the basis that the Members of
the League, whether or not actually parties to the Mandate, were
granted specific third-party or third-State rights by Article 7, the
difficulty remains. Even if there are principles of third-State law
which might otherwise cause those rights to survive, they can only
survive according to their terms. The States concerned having, by
their own act, divested themselves of the capacity in which they
enjoyed these rights, can no longer claim them, even on a third-



State basis; for no doctrine of third-State rights can extend to
enabling third States to continue to claim rights they have them-
selves, in effect, renounced.

*
* *

(b) Application of the general principles of law relative to capacity

In case the view stated above is thought to be unduly strict, we
would draw attention to the universally received general principle
of law—one essential to the orderly conduct of affairs—that rights
available to a person or entity in one capacity, do not remain avail-
able in another capacity—or if the first capacity comes to an end—
unless special arrangements have been made to produce this result.
This is constantly seen in the sphere of private law. Trustees,
administrators, curators, legal guardians, etc., have certain par-
ticular rights appertaining to their status in these capacities. The
moment such a status ceases, rights which are attached to the
status, and do not exist independently of it, also cease to exist.
Similarly, powers or faculties may be enjoyed in a specified capacity.
A change over to another status or capacity, or simply continued
existence as an individual, cannot carry with it the retention of
rights enjoyed in a previous capacity. In the same way, the mere
fact that the Applicant States in this case continue to exist as States;
or that, instead of being Members of the League, they are now
Members of the United Nations, gives them in itself—in the absence
of special arrangements to the contrary—no right at all, especially
after they have themselves terminated their League membership,
to continue to invoke a provision available only to Members of
the League.

It would hardly seem necessary to insist on such an elementary
point. Yet insist we must, since in our view it has been in substance
ignored by the Court. For instance, much has been heard in this case
of what might be called the “policing the Mandate” aspect of
Article 7. But could it seriously be suggested in every-day life that
if a police force is disbanded, its ex-members can still go on exer-
cizing their former police functions? This would seem to be an
extraordinary notion for any Court of law to endorse. If the former
Members of the League had any “police” functions under Article 7,
it was as Members of the police force which was the League—a
force now disbanded and dissolved.

Moreover—and this is not without its significance—it is not the
case, even if it were legally relevant, that the substance of the


5II JOINT DISS. OPIN. JUDGES SPENDER AND FITZMAURICE

Mandatory’s obligation would remain unaltered if this were now
owed to former Members of the League. This is because of the
different consequences that may result from a Judgment of
the present Court, as compared with the Permanent Court, having
regard to Article 94, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Charter,
Whatever the comparison between that Article and Article 1 3 (4)
of the Covenant, it is evident that there are substantial differences
between the two Articles. It is hardly appropriate to develop these
differences here; it is sufficient to say that in our opinion, not only
are the consequences that may flow from Article 94 (2) of the
Charter different from those which could have resulted from Article 13
(4) of the Covenant, but they could be more onerous in character.
Moreover, the Council was bound by the unanimity rule. Further-
more, under the Covenant it was for the Council, and for it alone,
to initiate what action, if any, it would propose, whereas the effect of
Article 94 (2) of the Charter is to invest the judgments of the present
Court with a backing of possible sanctions or enforcement action
at the instance of a State in whose favour judgment has been
pronounced. If, therefore, the Mandatory is still under an obligation,
by virtue of the combined effect of Article 37 of the Statute and
Article 7 of the Mandate, it is one that, potentially, has different
and more burdensome consequences than before. Thus to say that
the Mandatory is not being asked to submit to anything more than
it would have had to submit to in the days of the League is clearly
incorrect; and this situation, in our opinion, constitutes an absolute
bar to any extension or perpetuation of the Mandatory’s obligations
under Article 7, above and beyond its actual language, unless this
can be justified beyond possibility of reasonable doubt on the
basis of some applicable principle of legal interpretation or general
rule of law, particularly since it is reasonably evident, we think
that it is precisely in order to bring Article g4 of the Charter into
play that the present proceedings have been brought.

*

Since, in our view, the position is quite clear on the basis of the
actual language of Article 7, and of the ordinary law as to capacity,
we turn next to the question whether there is any applicable
principle of interpretation which would justify a different conclu-
sion. Two may be suggested: the principle of “maximum effect”,
and the principle of the “presumed intentions of the parties”.

(c) The principle of “maximum effect”

This principle is one which can be employed in order to give
as full a scope to a provision as is reasonably consistent with its



language, and with the general circumstances of the case; but
only if such an interpretation would be so consistent. It cannot
be employed to ‘‘re-write” a provision in a manner positively
inconsistent with, or even actually contrary to what it says.
Equally, its application must be excluded if the circumstances are
such as to evidence a complete lack of any basis for the interpreta-
tion that would result. We shall show later, in dealing with the
facts relative to the dissolution of the League, why we think that
this is precisely what the circumstances do show. For the moment
we will merely point out what the interpretation contended for
by the Applicants would really involve, for it is our view that
before the principle of “maximum effect” may with legal propriety
be applied, one must be prepared to write out the changes that
would be required in the provision concerned, if it had originally
been drafted so as expressly to produce the effect contended for;
and having done that, to consider whether the result remains
within the bounds of what can reasonably be regarded as legitimate
“interpretation”, or whether is goes beyond that, and amounts
to a revision or quasi-legislative “rectification” of the provision
in question.

In the present case, the interpretation the Applicant States
contend for could have been effected expressly by changes in
either Article 7 of the Mandate or in Article 37 of the Statute.
Changes in Article 7, expressed in its terms, could only have been
effected at the time when Article 7 was drafted, and must be
considered on that basis. Two possible methods may be envisaged.
One would have been to replace the phrase “another Member of the
League of Nations” by “any other State” or “any other interested
State” or ‘‘any other State which at any time is or has been a
Member of the League”. We consider that the chances of the Man-
datory, or for that matter any of the Mandatories, having been
willing in 1920 to accept any such sweeping wording—even if
anyone had suggested it—can be regarded as negligible.

Alternatively, the result contended for could have been achieved
by adding after the words “another Member of the League of
Nations”, some such phrase as “or, should the League at any
time be dissolved, any State which was a Member at the date of
dissolution”. In the next following subsection we shall give our
reasons for holding that it is quite out of the question that any
such language should have been employed in 1920.

As regards Article 37 of the Statute, what would be necessary
would be to suppose that it had contained (and to read it as
containing) an additional paragraph running somewhat as follows:

“Whenever any such treaty or convention provides for the refer-
ence to adjudication of disputes between Members of the League of
Nations, it shall, in the event of, and notwithstanding, the dissolu-
tion of the League, be deemed to relate to disputes between States
who were Members of the League at the date of its dissolution.”



It is our considered opinion that those who drew up the revised
Statute at the preliminary Washington Conference of March-April
1945, and subsequently at San Francisco, would never have taken
the leap in the dark which such a commitment would have involved,
without carrying out a most careful preliminary investigation of
the treaties that might be affected, in order to see just what such
a commitment would amount to. No such investigation was, so
far as we are aware, ever carried out; and in the circumstances,
we do not believe it is possible to imply in Article 37 such additional
words as would have produced the effect contended for, as if they
had been originally included in terms.

To sum up on this point—we consider that the application
of the principle of maximum effect in the present case would involve
an inadmissible degree of rectification of the provisions concerned,
altogether exceeding the bounds of what is possible by way of
legitimate interpretation. We would recall that in the second phase
of the Peace Treaties case (which had certain marked affinities with
the present one), the Court took exactly the opposite line to the
one it is now taking. Despite a finding that some of the parties
were in breach of what the Court had held to be a treaty obligation
to appoint their members of certain three-member tribunals pro-
vided for under the Peace Treaties, the Court nevertheless rejected
the view that, in the circumstances, the relevant adjudication
clause could legitimately be interpreted so as to permit a two-
member, instead of a three-member, tribunal to function. To do
that, the Court held, in a phrase which has since become part of
the common stock of international legal phraseology, would be
“not to interpret treaties but to revise them”. In short, the Court
refused to rectify a provision which, on its actual terms, and in
the circumstances which had arisen, was inadequate to produce
the result contended for. It is precisely such a rectification which
the Court is in our view now effecting, and with considerably less
legal warrant than would have existed for a rectification in the Peace
Treaties case.

Another reason why extensive interpretations of Article 7 are
not justified unless there is the clearest warrant for them, is the
unilateral character of that provision. It could be invoked against,
but not by, the Mandatory, even if the latter should itself want a
legal ruling on some point relating to the Mandate arising in a
dispute with another Member of the League. This makes it all the
more necessary to interpret Article 7 strictly, or at least
scrupulously.

(d) The presumed intentions of the parties

We now turn to the second principle of interpretation on the
basis of which a different conclusion from the one we have come
to may be urged. It has been a major contention in this case that
in the life-time of the League, although some States might, by
leaving the League, lose their right to invoke Article 7, there
always remained other States which could invoke it, so that Article 7
could never become a dead letter. If, however, Article 7 had to
be read according to its strict language now, there would—so the
argument runs—be no State which could invoke it, so that it would
cease to operate at all; this void can never have been intended
by the original framers of the Mandate, consequently it must be
filled by reading Article 7 as still conferring rights on ex-Members
of the League.

Since a situation in which there would be no States qualified
to invoke Article 7 could only arise by reason of the complete
dissolution or break-up of the League, this contention must pre-
suppose either that the original framers foresaw that possibility,
or that, had they foreseen it, they would have provided for it,
and would have done so in the sense contended for by the Ap-
plicants.

It is clear that if the framers actually foresaw the possibility,
then their failure to provide for it must have been deliberate, and
therefore the argument based on their “presumed intentions’ would
lead to the opposite conclusion, namely that the void ought not to
be made good by any interpretative process.

It is, however, evident that those concerned did %o# foresee,
and would have refused to contemplate, a possible break-up of the
League. But even supposing them to have done so, we can see no
ground on which it could legitimately be assumed that they would
have made express provision for the continuance in force of Arti-
cle 7, of the Mandatory's obligation to submit to compulsory
adjudication. If any assumption at all could be made, it would have
to be in the opposite sense, for the circumstances in which a break-
up of the League would or might occur, must necessarily have been
quite unforeseeable in 1920; and it is as certain as anything can
be that none of the Mandatory Powers (not only South Africa)
would have been willing to accept a obligation unlimited in point
of time to submit to adjudication, which would still remain operative
in a situation the nature of which nobody could predict. At that
date (1920) willingness to submit to compulsory adjudication at all
Was a comparative rarity, and would certainly not have been
forthcoming for an obligation of limitless duration under unknown
conditions.

What the Applicants are really asking the Court to do, is to
interpret Article 7 in the light of the presumed intentions of the



parties as these might have been expected to be had they foreseen
not only that the League would be dissolved, but the circumstances
in which this would occur, i.e. that the League would be followed
by the United Nations, that the trusteeship system would be set up,
and so on. But it is not a legitimate process of interpretation
to read a provision on the basis of presumed intentions deduced
in the light of nothing but after-knowledge. One can only deduce
intentions in the light of what the parties might reasonably have
been expected to foresee at the time, and not on what those inten-
tions might have been had the parties had an actual foreknowledge
of the future, which they could never in fact have had.

The time for facing, and providing for, the consequences of
the break-up of the League, so far as Article 7 was concerned, was
of course not in 1920, when the Mandate was framed, but in 1945-
1946, when the League was breaking up. However, this was not
done; and we shall presently give our reasons for thinking that this
was not due to any oversight but deliberately and for good cause.
This being so, we know of no principle which, merely because mat-
ters have not in fact turned out as the parties, or some of them,
may have anticipated, would enable, let alone require, a Court of
law to take remedial action in the guise of some process of inter-
pretation.

3. Other contentions

We have now to consider certain other contentions on the
basis of which it has been claimed that the Applicant States in this
case are entitled to invoke Article 7. These are founded on more or
less extraneous considerations, such as the situation which has
now arisen in regard to the Mandate, or the provisions of other in-
struments, etc. A number of these arguments we will not deal with,
partly for reasons of space, but mainly because they do not
seam to us to be legal arguments at all. They are no more than
metives or reasons for urging that it is politically desirable that the
Applicants should be allowed to invoke Article 7, and that the
Court should assume jurisdiction. This feeling, understandable
though it may be, cannot have any bearing on the legal issues
involved, and these must be our sole concern.

Another group of arguments which do have a legal character—
though in our view they are unsound—we shall not deal with
because they are not effectively relied upon by the Judgment of
the Court in the present case, although they were much discussed
by the Parties in their written and oral pleadings, and were directly
or indirectly relied upon by the Court in the 1950 case—such as
for instance the argument based on Article 80, paragraph I, of the



United Nations Charter !, or on a supposed “carry-over” or devolu-
tion of the functions, powers or rights of the League of Nations
and its Members in respect of mandated territories, in favour of the
United Nations and its Members.

The contentions we shall deal are broadly of three kinds, based
(a) on the institutional character of the Mandate, and its survival
as an institution, if not as a treaty or convention; (5) on the alleged-
ly essential and necessary function performed by Article 7 in the
scheme of the Mandate; and (¢) on assurances said to have been
given by the Mandatory in 1946 in anticipation of the dissolution
of the League, and to have involved an agreement to be bound
by Article 7 in relation to any State which was a Member of the
League at the date of its dissolution.

*

(a) The institutional basis and effects of the Mandate

The contention advanced under this head is briefly that the
admitted survival of the Mandate as an institution necessarily
implies its survival complete and with all its parts intact, including
Article 7. If, however, Article 7 could only be invoked by Members

1 Article 80 (1) of the Charter has nothing to do with the Court’s jurisdiction.

It has however been sought to call it in aid as follows: the Article, it is said,
“conserved” the rights of States; one of these rights was that stated in Article 7 of
the Mandate instrument; therefore the right survived the League dissolution until
the mandated territory was brought under trusteeship.

The argument is not only inherently unsound, it ignores the words of Article 80 (1).
This Article is clearly an interpretation clause, commonly called a saving clause,
of a type frequently to be found in legislative or treaty instruments, designed to
prevent Statute or Treaty provisions being interpreted so as to operate beyond their
intendment.

Such a clause does not, except in a loose and quite indefinite sense, ‘‘conserve’
any rights. It prevents the operation of the Statute or Treaty from affecting them
(whatever they are and whatever their content) except as provided by the Statute
or Treaty. Article 80 (1) does not maintain or stabilize rights as they existed at the
date of the Charter coming into operation, nor does it insure the continuance of
those rights or increase or diminish them. It leaves them unaffected by Chapter XII
of the Charter.

What Article 80 (1) does not say is as important as what it does say. It does not
say that rights shall continue. It does not provide that these rights shall not there-
after, until trusteeship agreements have been concluded, be subject to the operation
of law, or that they shall not terminate or be extinguished by effluxion of time,
failure of purpose, impossibility of performance or for any other reason. It does
not say these rights shall not be altered or be subject to alteration even by normal
legal processes.

It is evident that the purpose of Article 80 (1) was quite different to what has
been contended and does not lend itself by any rational method of interpretation
to support the contention advanced. The sole purpose of the Article was to prevent
any provision of Chapter XII of the Charter being construed so as to alter existing
rights prior to a certain event. :



of the League of Nations (now non-existent) it would for all practical
purposes not have survived. Hence any State which was a Member
of the League at the time of its dissolution must be entitled to
invoke it.

This contention seems to us to involve two fallacies. The first is
the view that the survival or continued existence of an institu-
tion does necessarily entail the survival or continued existence
intact of all its parts. We will return to this. The second is that
survival can somehow operate to add stature to the institution, so
to speak, giving it an added effect, and that a provision can survive
otherwise than in accordance with its own terms. In our opinion,
Article 7 has survived only in the sense that it has not been actually
excised from the Mandate instrument, and still stands on paper as
part of the original League of Nations Resolution or Declaration of
December 17, 1920. As part of the Mandate instrument, and on the
basis that this instrument is or represents a treaty or convention
in force, the Court must determine the application of Article 7
and may do so (and in our view may only do so) by finding that,
as it only gives rights to Members of the League, the Applicants
cannot invoke it. The Court cannot, in our view, properly apply
it in any other way, for if it still stands part of the Mandate instru-
ment, then by that very token it stands part of it in the same terms
as it was originally framed for purposes of insertion in that instru-
ment, and which have never been amended. The Court could not
therefore both rely on the continued presence of Article 7 in the
Mandate instrument, and refuse to apply it in accordance with the
terms in which it figures there.

But, correct as this is, we do not wish to rest our view on any
mere argument of logic. The substantial grounds on which we reject
the contention based on the survival of the Mandate as an institution
are first, that we regard as fallacious the view that if an institution
survives, all its parts must survive too; and secondly, that we
regard as incorrect the further view that a provision for compulsory
adjudication, such as Article 7, has such a character of inherent
necessity in the context of the Mandates System, that a continued
and substantive field of application must be postulated for it, as
an essential element of the System.

As regards the first of these questions, there is in fact no principle
of international law which requires that because an instrument or
institution survives or continues in existence, it must necessarily
do so with respect to all its parts on a completely non-severable
basis. The position is quite the contrary: international law postu-
lates no incompatibility between the survival, or continued existence
of an international agreement, organ or institution, and a termi-



nation or cessation, on one ground or another, of some particular
part of it, or of particular functions, rights or obligations provided
for by it. This situation is indeed rather a common one, and it quite
often occurs that, for instance, an instrument remains in force, but
that some particular provision of it ceases or has ceased any longer
to be operative, because its terms have become inapplicable, or
because it is now impossible of performance, or for some other
reason.

If an inspection of a particular clause shows that, although an
instrument or institution survives as such, the clause concerned is
no longer possible of performance, or can no longer be applied
according to its terms (as is the case with Articles 6 and 7 of the
Mandate) then the prima facie conclusion must be that although
the instrument or institution otherwise remains intact, that particu-
lar clause is at an end.

The only circumstances in which it might be possible to maintain


Under this head the Respondent State denies that there is any
dispute between itself and the Applicant States, substantively of
the kind to which Article 7 of the Mandate was intended to relate,
and it accordingly claims that the condition that there should be
a “dispute” within the intention of Article 7'is not fulfilled.

Before we consider this contention, we must deal with a related
point. Article 7 requires not only that there should be a dispute,
but also that this dispute should be between the Mandatory and
“another Member of the League of Nations”. For the purposes
of this Third Objection it has of course to be assumed that, contrary
to the conclusions we have come to on the First and Second Pre-
liminary Objections, the Applicants must be deemed to fulfil the
condition of League Membership, or alternatively that the Applic-
ants are entitled to invoke Article 7 despite the termination of their
League Membership.

The question still remains however, before we consider the charac-
ter of the disputes Article 7 was intended to relate to, is there in
the present case any dispute at all, propetly speaking, between the
Applicant and the Respondent States? Both on the language of
Article 7, and that of the Statute of the Court, and equally as a
matter of general principle, what is necessary is that the dispute
in respect of which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked should
be a dispute between the actual parties to the proceedings before
the Court.

Clearly, a dispute is not created or constituted merely by bringing
proceedings, putting in an Application or invoking a compulsory
adjudication clause—for otherwise the requirement in the clause
(and there always is such a requirement) that there should be a
dispute would .be redundant. In the present case, is there in the
proper sense, any dispute between the Applicant States and the
Respondent, other than such as-arises out of the mere fact that
proceedings have been instituted by the Applicants against the
Respondent?

It seems to us that there is not. It is common knowledge that
the present case finds its whole fons et origo in, and springs directly
from, the activities of the United Nations Assembly relative to
the Mandated territory and the Mandatory. No one who studies
the record of the proceedings in the Assembly, and of the various
Assembly Committees and Sub-Committees which have been
concerned with the matter, and especially the Assembly Resolutions
on South West Africa which directly led up to the institution of
the present proceedings before the Court, can doubt for a moment
that the real dispute over South West Africa is between the Respond-
ent State and the United Nations Assembly, and that the Applicant



States are in fact appearing in a representational capacity to bring
proceedings which the Assembly cannot bring for itself because,
under Article 34 of the Statute, only States can appear in contentious
proceedings before the Court.

On this ground alone therefore, we consider we would be justified
in holding that, there being no real dispute between the Respondent
State and the Applicant States in their individual capacities, this
condition of Article 7 is not fulfilled.

It is admitted that the Applicants have no direct material in-
terests involved in this case. Neither their own national interests
nor those of any of their nationals under the Mandate instrument
or in the Mandated territory are affected. They are appearing—
and this is admitted—solely for the purpose of defending or up-
holding the Mandate, in the interest not of themselves, but of the
inhabitants of the Mandated territory, and this they are doing at
the instance of the Assembly, as clearly appears from the Assembly
Resolutions of 1361 (XIV) of November 1959, and 1565 (XV) of
December 1960.

It is not for us to comment on this process, except in so far as
we have to consider what the legal consequences are. We realise
that States, parties to a treaty or convention, or who have third-
State rights under it, may in certain types of cases be held to have
a legal interest in its due observance, even though the. alleged
breach of it has not, or not yet, affected them directly. But since
we do not regard the Mandate as being a treaty or convention, or
the Applicant States as being parties to it as such (if it were one)
and since we consider them to have lost the capacity under which
they might have been able to claim any rights on a third State
basis, we could not regard them as having any legal interest in the
matter by virtue of any direct participation in the Mandate.

Even if we should be wrong as to that, however, the plain fact
is that the real, present interest of the Applicant States in these
proceedings is as Members of the United Nations, as participators
in the activities of the United Nations Assembly relative to South
West Africa, and because of the interest which, on the basis of the
Opinion given by the Court in 1950, the Assembly considers itself
to have in the question of the conduct of the Mandate. It is well
established in international jurisprudence that it is the situation
as it stood immediately prior to the commencement of proceedings
to which regard must be had. Any “dispute” which the Applicant
States then had with the Respondent State was in the United
Nations, in their capacity as Members of it, and was conducted
within the framework of the Assembly, again as Members of it.



Nor has what has taken place in the Assembly been strictly
in the nature of a dispute, properly so-called, so much as a po-
litical conflict of views. The Applicant States have not had, and
do not have any conflict of view with the Respondent State over
and above, or different from, that which a great many of the
other States represented in the Assembly have, equally as Members
of it; and their interest in the matter is equally no different from
or greater than that of many other Members. In particular, they
have no specific individual ground of dispute with the Respondent
State outside the Assembly, as is shown by their failure to open,
or attempt to conduct, any direct negotiations with the Respondent
State through the diplomatic channel.

Throughout, up to the time of bringing these proceedings,
the Applicants have acted in their capacity as Members of the
United Nations; and for all the difference it would have made to
the essential character of the present proceedings, these might just
as well have been brought by any other States coming within
the category of ex-Members of the former League of Nations.
The pleadings could have been identical, apart from the name of the
plaintiffs.

We do not consider that a dispute which has been conducted by
a State (if “conducted” is the proper term at all) solely within the
framework of an international organization, in its capacity as a
member of the organization, and by simple participation in its
activities, without the dispute ever having been taken up directly
with the defendant State outside the organization, can constitute
a dispute between States of the kind envisaged by the normal
adjudication clause.

We must therefore conclude that prior to the bringing of the
present proceedings (which was not per se enough) there was not,
properly speaking, a dispute between the Respondent State and the
Applicant States as such, within the normal intention of a juris-
dictional clause such as Article 7 of the Mandate, and that accor-
dingly the requirement that there should be a dispute between
the Mandatory and the Applicant States is not fulfilled.

*
% *

The defect to which we have just drawn attention is in a certain
sense a technical one, though the technicality is far from being
unimportant. But it could be cured by time and appropriate action.
We have a more fundamental reason for holding that the dispute,
or rather ground of complaint involved in the present case, is not
one contemplated by Article 7.

The Mandate (and this is still more so in the case of other categories
of Mandates) has two main classes of substantive provisions. The
first (which might be called the “conduct of the Mandate” class)



comprises the provisions inserted for the benefit of the peoples of
the territory. The other (which might be called the “State rights
and interests” class) comprises those which were inserted for the
national benefit of the Members of the League and their nationals
{commercialrights, open door, freedom for missionary activities, etc.).

The question is whether Article 7 of the Mandate (this was a
common clause in all the Mandate), relates to both these clas-
ses of provision, or only to the latter. At first sight, on a literal
reading of Article 7, the answer might appear clear: it specifies
“any dispute whatever ... relating to the interpretation or the ap-
plication of the provisions of the Mandate”. Since we be-
lieve in the principle of interpreting provisions according to their
natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur,
and (in the absence of any ambiguities or contradictions) without
reference to travaux préparatoires, we must state why we feel
unable to take the above passage at its face value, and why we
consider a reference to the travaux préparatoires to be justified in
this case, quite apart from the fact that these have in any event
been so extensively relied upon in connection with the First and
Second Preliminary Objections, that it would hardly be possible
to exclude them from consideration of the third, which is definitely
related to the others.

The phrase we have just cited from Article 7 does not give the
full sense of the relevant passage, and to obtain this a fuller citation
is required, as follows: “any dispute whatever … between the Man
datory and another Member of the League of Nations relating to
the interpretation or application of the provisions of the Mandate”.
Having regard to the view we take as to the meaning of a “dispute”,
and the necessity for a direct dispute between the parties to the
proceedings, in which they have an interest in their own capacity,
and not merely as Members of an international organization, the
above passage, in the context of this case, conceals an ambiguity.
The words could be read as meaning any dispute whatever hav-
ing the character just mentioned. In our view the Applicants had
not, at the critical date (that of the Applications), any interest in
the matter (even in the conduct of the Mandate) except in their
capacity as Members of the United Nations. On that ground
alone we should not regard the case as covered.

*

There is however another much more important ambiguity
which makes it necessary to enquire whether “any dispute what-
ever” means any dispute about the provisions of the Man-
date generally, or whether it must be regarded as being con-
fined to any dispute whatever about those provisions of the



Mandate which affect State or national rights or interests.
This arises because of the immediately following requirement
that the dispute shall be one that “cannot be settled by negotia-
tion”.

The implications of this phrase are, in our view, the key to the
whole question of what is covered by Article 7. “Negotiation”,
we think, as contemplated by such a provision as Article 7, means
negotiation between the parties to the proceedings before the Court.
Under the head of the fourth preliminary objection we shall give
our reasons for so thinking. For the moment we will assume,
what would certainly have been assumed by anyone dealing with
the matter at the time when the Mandate was drafted, namely
that negotiation means negotiation between, or directly for and
on behalf of the actual parties to the proceedings before the
Court.

Now a requirement that a dispute must be such as “cannot”
be settled by negotiation, necessarily implies that it be of a type
capable of being so settled, and of being so settled by negotiation
between parties competent for that purpose. If a dispute
could not be settled (i.e. is inherently incapable of settlement)
by any kind of negotiation at all between the parties before the
Court, then clearly a requirement that the dispute be one that
“cannot” be settled by negotiation would be meaningless.

By ‘settlement’, we understand final settlement, and a final
settlement to us means a settlement negotiated between parties
having competence to settle the particular dispute in a final
manner. The question therefore arises, could the Applicant and
Respondent States, by negotiation inter se, settle in any way what-
ever a dispute not relating to their own State or national rights
or interests, but belonging to the “conduct of the Mandate”
type—the sacred trust—could any settlement negotiated between
single States, such as the Applicant States and the Mandatory,
settle any question relating to the general conduct of the Mandate
itself? Could any such settlement, arrived at between the Appli-
cants and the Respondent alone, bind any other State conceiving
itself to have an interest in the conduct of the Mandate—or bind
the United Nations Assembly? Obviously not—such a settlement
might be wholly inacceptable to these other entities.

It is not, in our view, a sufficient answer to say that a settle-
ment between the Applicant and Respondent States would have
been a settlement, inasmuch as it would have precluded the
Applicants from bringing any proceedings under Article 7. Such
a settlement would have settled nothing vis-a-vis any other



State dissatisfied with it, or in the United Nations Assembly",
and would not, from the point of view of the Respondent, have
genuinely settled anything.

It is common knowledge that the present proceedings have
been brought because the decision of the Court would be binding
on the Mandatory. Elementary principles of justice and good faith
therefore require that if the Mandatory should be able to achieve a
settlement of the dispute directly with the Applicant States (which
it has never yet been asked to do) such a settlement should be
final, and good erga omnes. But obviously any such settlement
could not have this effect.

Again, let it be assumed, since that contingency may not be
excluded, that, on the merits, the Court found un favour of the
Respondent. Such a decision would be res judicata only for the
Applicant States (Article 59 of the Statute). It would not bind
the United Nations Assembly, nor would it bind any States except
the Applicants. Any other State dissatisfied with it could, at some
future time, bring fresh proceedings on exactly or substantially
the same grounds, with results that might be the same, or again
might not. From the Mandatory’s point of view there could be no
finality. On the other hand a decision given against the Respondent
would be binding on it, and would enable Article 94 of the Charter
to be invoked if necessary by the other Party.

The evident disparity between these two situations is not easy
to reconcile with normal principles of justice, and we do not believe
that anything so lop-sided could have been in contemplation when
Article 7 was drafted. We consider that, as its wording clearly
implies, this provision was only intended to relate to disputes of a
kind which are capable of being settled by negotiation, and of which
therefore, in the given case, it can legitimately be held (if the facts
so warrant) that the dispute “cannot’ be so settled; and we consider
further, that the only kind of dispute of that character, is one
involving the national rights or interests of the States concern-
ed. These they are competent to settle in a final manner by negotia-
tion. Disputes about the general conduct of the Mandate, in relation
to the inhabitants of the territory, are disputes which, in principle,
are not capable of being so settled merely by a negotiation between
the Mandatory and another State. The obligations of the Man-
datory in relation to the “sacred trust” are of their nature not
negotiable as between the Mandatory and another State Member of
the League. The present dispute is of the latter kind, and therefore
we do not consider that it comes under Article 7.

1It is of course no answer to say that in practice the Applicants would not have
negotiated any settlement they did not know would be acceptable to the Assembly;
‘Or if it is an answer, it is a revealing one which can only bear out our view that the
dispute in this case is not really with the Applicants.



*

We now wish to refer briefly to a further point that seems to
us of hardly less importance. We find it impossible to reconcile
the view that Article 7 relates to disputes about the general conduct
of the Mandate, with the supervisory functions given to the Council
of the League under Article 6 of the Mandate. The conjunction would
mean that although the League Council might have been perfectly
satisfied with the Mandatory’s conduct of the Mandate, or might
even have made suggestions to the Mandatory about that, which
the latter was complying with and carrying out, any Member
of the League not satisfied with the Mandatory’s conduct, or not
agreeing with the Council's views, could have brought proceedings
before the Permanent Court under Article 7.

There would have been an even more extraordinary possibility. A
Member of the League might, on some point relative to the conduct
of the Mandate, have obtained from the Permanent Court a decision
which was not in fact in the best interests of the peoples of the
mandated territory—due, say, to lack of sufficient technical data
before the Court. Yet under Article 59 of the Statute, the Mandatory
would have been bound by the decision, and obliged to apply it
vis-à-vis the inhabitants, although the Council of the League might
have been wholly opposed to it and itself not bound by it.

We cannot believe it was ever intended that it should be possible
for such situations to arise, and in estimating this, one must, for
reasons we have given earlier in this Opinion, place oneself at the
point in time when these provisions, Articles 6 and 7, were being
drafted as designed portions of a coherent and integrated whole,
which the Mandate certainly would not have been if Article 7 had
had the meaning attributed to it by the Court.

The situations we have described as capable of arising if Article 7
is regarded as relating to disputes about the conduct of the Mandate
are in no way fanciful or hypothetical. One of them has actually
arisen in another case, with reference to a provision substantially
the same as Article 7 in a United Nations trusteeship agreement.

It is in our opinion hardly conceivable that those who created
a system according to which the Mandates were to be exercized
“on behalf of the League”, and the Mandatory was to be responsible,
and solely responsible, to the Council of the League, should have
been willing so far to dilute the Council’s authority (especially when



the Council could itself go to the Permanent Court for an Advisory
Opinion), as to give a wholly independent right of recourse to the
Court to Members of the League, not merely for the protection of
their own individual rights and interests, but in the very field
of the general conduct of the Mandate which was peculiarly the
Councils.

*
* *

These various considerations lead us to hold that, despite
the apparently plain language of Article 7 of the Mandate, on a
literal interpretation of the words “any dispute whatever”, analysis
shows its real meaning and intention to be different, and to exlude
disputes about the general conduct of the Mandate. If there is
any room for doubt, then this is a case in which reference to the
travaux préparatoires is justified, in order to see whether they
confirm the foregoing interpretation, and to this we shall now
proceed.

Before the end of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, a Mandates
Commission was established to consider possible draft terms for
the various Mandates!. At its first meeting on June 28, 1919, a
draft ‘“C’’ Mandate in the form of five suggested articles was submit-
ted for discussion. This draft contained no adjudication clause. Nor
did it contain any clause dealing with freedom of worship or the
provisions in relation to missionaries, nationals of any State Member
of the League, to enter and reside in the territory, etc., as was
subsequently to be set forth in Article 5 of the “C’”’ Mandate instru-
ments.

At its next meeting on July 8, the Commission had before it not
only the draft “C” Mandate, but also two draft “B” Mandates,
one proposed by the representative of France which was to form
the basis of discussion, and another presented by the United States.
The French “B” draft was brief, and contained eleven compa-
ratively short articles. It contained no adjudication clause. The
United States draft, on the other hand, contained apart from
certain clauses dealing the conduct of the Mandate in relation to
the peoples of the Mandated territory, a number of clauses which
provided in considerable detail for rights to be accorded to States
Members of the League, and their subjects or nationals, in respect
of a number of different matters. This United States draft contained
an adjudication clause, and it is clear from the record—and this is
what we draw attention to—that the discussion on this adjudica-

Paris 1934, at page 327.



tion clause, appearing in the United States draft only, centred round
these detailed rights to be accorded to Members of the League and
their nationals under that draft. The adjudication clause read as
follows:

“If any dispute should arise between the Members of the League
of Nations regarding the interpretation or application of the present
Convention and the dispute cannot be settled by negotiation, it will
be referred to the Permanent Court of Justice...

The subjects or citizens of the States Members of the League
of Nations may also refer claims relating to breaches of their rights
conferred upon them by Articles 5, 6, 7, 7a and 7b of the Mandate
to the Court for decision. The judgment given by the Court will be
without appeal in the fwo above mentioned cases and will have the
same effect as an arbitral award rendered pursuant to Article 13 of
the Covenant.” (Italics ours.)

The articles of the United States “B’’ draft, as above indicated
provided for what may conveniently be described as an “open
door” to carry on trade and commerce, etc., accorded to subjects
and nationals of States Members of the League (Article 5); religious
freedom, and provision for missionaries (Article 6); equality of
opportunity for the commerce and navigation for all States, Mem-
bers of the League and provision against discrimination between
subjects and nationals of State Members of the League (Article 7);
concessions in respect of railways, post offices, telegraphs, radio
stations and other public works or services without distinction,
etc, between subjects or nationals of States, Members of the
League (Article 7 a); and a kind of most-favoured-nation provision
in favour of States, Members of the League (Article 7 b) and their
nationals.

These clauses thus provided for a series of rights to be conferred
both upon States, Members of the League, and upon their subjects
and citizens. The wording of the adjudication clause itself was
somewhat peculiar and not very good. The second paragraph ap-
peared to confer some kind of direct right of action on the nationals
of the Members States —an idea which did not last. Looking at the
clause as a whole, and at the words we have italicized in it, and
considering the context in which it was proposed and discussed, it
appears clear that the first paragraph of it was intended to relate to
the rights and interests of the Member States under the Mandate,
and the second to those of their nationals under certain specified
articles, some of which covered both rights of nationals as well as
State rights.

Briefly, the position appears to have been that no one thought
of having a provision for compulsory adjudication until the United
States made detailed proposals for commercial and other State
rights for Members of the League and their nationals, and it was



in this context and in no other that the adjudication clause was
discussed. The matter progressed on this footing.

At its next meeting on 9 July, the Commission continued its
examination of both the French and United States draft “B”
Mandates; but the French draft was taken as the basis of discus-
sion, article by article. The first four Articles dealt with the kind
of thing that appears in the first four Articles of the Mandate for
South West Africa and these were, with certain amendments,
provisionally adopted.

The Commission then took up Article 5 of the French ‘B’ draft.
The first paragraph, which was very short, provided for equal
rights for citizens of States Members of the League in relation to
residence, protection of their persons and property, the acquisition
of fixed and movable property and the exercise of their callings, all
on the same basis as that accorded to nationals of the Mandatory
Power. This was accepted after amendment.

The remaining part of the French clause 5, which—again in
brief terms, and in principle only—dealt with equality of commercial
opportunity for nationals of State Members of the League, freedom
of navigation and transit, and protection against discriminatory
duties on merchandise, was examined in conjunction with Article 7
of the United States draft.

The Commission then proceeded to consider whether there would
be any advantages in inserting, in this French clause 5, detailed
stipulations such as the United States ‘B’ draft provided. The
representative of the United States contended that they were
necessary in order to ensure satisfactory execution by the Manda-
tory. The record then reads:

“Lord Robert Cecil (British Empire) thought that that question
was linked with the right of recourse to the International Court.
If the right of recourse were to be granted, it would be preferable
merely to lay down the principle of equality and leave it to the
Court to apply the principle to particular cases. He thought however
it would be desirable to replace the words ‘commercial equality’
(‘égalité commerciale’)—which appeared in the French drait—by the
words ‘commercial and industrial equality’. If on the other hand,
no right of recourse to the Court was to be given, it would be
necessary to elaborate stipulations in detail.”

The morning session concluded with this observation. This discus-
sion, we think, shows very clearly that the purpose of the adjudica-
tion clause, and the sole context in which it was considered, was
the protection of the commercial and other rights of States Members
of the League, and those of their nationals, as intended to be confer-
red on them by the Mandate instruments.

It was in consequence of this discussion that the first matter
taken up by the Commission at its afternoon session on the same



day was Article 15 of the United States draft, which contained the
adjudication clause above quoted. The Commission proposed to
continue its discussion of Article 5 of the French draft, but on the
suggestion of the Representative of the United States, agreed first
to examine this adjudication clause.

The Representative of France said that he had no objection in
principle to resort to an international Court, but he thought that if
that procedure were open to private individuals, any sort of
administration would become impossible. The President agreed.
Recourse to the Court should be the responsibility of a Government.
He thought there would certainly be some advantage in trans-
ferring from the political to the legal plane the settlement of questions
such as those concerning property rights (“le règlement des questions
comme celle du droit de propriété”), but asked whether Govern-
ments should not assume the responsibility for deciding whether a
claim should be referred to the Court (52 la réclamation doit être
portée devant la Cour).

To meet this position, Lord Robert Cecil then proposed that the
second paragraph of the adjudication clause should read:

“The Members of the League of Nations will also be entitled on
behalf of their subjects or citizens to refer claims for breaches
of their rights”, etc.

This met the various points of view. It was accepted by the Re-
presentative of the United States, and was adopted, apparently
without further discussion.

The next step was the omission of the last sentence of the United
States adjudication clause, namely that which provided that the
judgment of the Court in each case should be final and have the
same effect as an award under Article 13 of the Covenant. This
sentence became superfluous if all claims had to be referred
to the Court by Governments, whether in respect of their own rights
under the Mandates, or of those of their nationals.

The Commission then returned to the examination of the final
part of Article 5 of the French ‘B’ draft, and since it was this draft
which was the basis of all further consideration, not the United
States draft with its detailed provisions for rights to be accorded
to States or their nationals, the reference to “Articles 5, 6,7, 7a
and 75” in the adjudication clause was omitted. Article 5 of the
French draft was then tentatively approved with some amend-
ments.

The Commission then took up a fresh draft of the “C’’ Mandates.
This draft now contained a new article, the final form of which
appears as Article 5 of the Mandate for South West Africa, guaran-
teeing freedom of worship in the mandated territory, and freedom
for missionary activities on the part of nationals of Members of
the League. In this same draft there appeared, equally for the first



time, an adjudication clause in broadly the same terms as were
eventually submitted to the Council of the League on December 14,
1920, and adopted by it after amendment in its resolution of
December 17, 1920, promulgating the Mandate.

It seems to us therefore that the record could hardly make it
plainer than it does that the drafting of what might for convenience
be called the national rights clauses of the Mandates, and the draft-
ing of the adjudication clause, went hand in hand, each reacting
on the other, and that the adjudication clause was never discussed
in the context of the obligations of the Mandatories relative to the
peoples of the mandated territories. To borrow the words of Lord
Finlay in one of the Mavrommatis cases (P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 2,
at p. 43) in relation to the Palestine Mandate: ‘Under these heads
[i.e. of the commercial, etc, rights of States and their nationals]
there are endless possibilities of dispute between the Mandatory
and other Members of the League of Nations, and it was highly

necessary that a Tribunal should be provided for the settlement
of such disputes”! Never at any time during the settlement of
the drafts was there the slightest suggestion that the adjudication
clause was intended to serve quite a different purpose, namely the
policing of the sacred trust.

It is evident that it had no relation to the trust obligations of
the Mandatory to the peoples of the territories. It was designed to
serve a less lofty purpose. It is quite inconceivable that if Article 7
was of the fundamentally essential character stated by the Court;
created as one of the securities for the performance of the Covenant,
providing the Court as the final bulwark to secure the performance
of the sacred trust, that not one word is to be found in the records
which gives support to the Court’s view 2.

To sum up, our study of the record confirms the view which we
had antecedently and independently formed, on the basis of the
language of Article 7, and in the context of the Mandate as a
whole. This view is, first, that Article 7 must be understood as
referring to a dispute in the traditional sense of the term, as it
would have been understood in 1920, namely a dispute between

1 We cite Lord Finlay. We do not cite other juristic authority, but we draw
attention to the exactly similar view to our own, expressed as representing the
general opinion of international lawyers, by Mr. Feinberg in his Hague Academy
course of 1937, quoted in full in the Dissenting Opinion of the President of the
Court in the present case. .

2 The degree of importance which the United States in 1920 placed upon the
equality of commercial and industrial opportunity in the mandated territories is
to be seen in the correspondence which passed between it and the Council of the
League and the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between November
1920 and March 1921. Annexes 154 and 154a, b, and c, Minutes 12th Session
Council of League.



the actual parties before the Court about their own interests, in
which they appear as representing themselves and not some other
entity or interest; and secomdly, that Article 7 in the general
context and scheme of the Mandate, was intended to enable the
Members of the League to protect their own rights and those of
their nationals, and not to enable them to intervene in matters
affecting solely the conduct of the Mandate in relation to the peoples
of the mandated territory.

In this last connection we consider that the record completely
confirms the view we have taken in rejecting the argument that
Article 7 was introduced, and was essential, in order to compensate
for the fact that, by reason of Article 34 of the Statute of the Court
{which incidentally had not been drafted in 1919 when the Mandates
Commission held its deliberations), the Council of the League could
not appear in contentious proceedings, but could only request
advisory opinions, and could not therefore, in the last resort, obtain
any binding decision against the Mandatory. We have expressed the
view that it was foreign to the climate of opinion of 1919-20 to
insert an adjudication provision with such a purpose in mind, and
the record confirms this. It was not to enable Members of the League
to assist the Council in upholding the Mandate that Article 7 was
introduced, but to enable them to protect their own national rights
which the Council would have no special interest in doing.

A further point, confirming the same vicw, is that the key provi-
sion as regards the interests of the peoples of the mandated terri-
tory, which appears in the “C” Mandates (Article 2) as an obliga-
tion for the Mandatory to promote to the utmost the peoples’
material and moral well-being and social progress, and in a some-
what different form in the ‘B’’ Mandates, does not figure in the
“A” Mandates at all. Yet an adjudication clause similar to Article 7
does figure there— evidently because the “A” Mandates contained
(as they did) provisions concerning the rights and interests of
Members of the League and their nationals in the mandated ter-
ritory and for no other reason.

ES
* *

There is only one further point we need deal with under this
head, namely the argument sought to be drawn from the existence
of what is known as the “Tanganyika Clause”.

As has been seen, in the course of the drafting, the original
division of the adjudication clause into two parts (State rights;
rights of nationals) was eliminated, because once it had been agreed
that all proceedings of whatever character must be brought by
governments, whether on their own behalf or that of their nationals,
the raison d’être for this division disappeared. In only one Mandate



was it unaccountably preserved, that for British East Africa, the
adjudication clause of which has a first paragraph in Article 7
terms, and a second providing that Members of the League could
also bring before the Court complaints on behalf of their nationals?
From this it has been sought to draw the conclusion that the first
paragraph of the Tanganyika clause (and hence any provision
such as Article 7 having similar terms to this first paragraph)
must have related to disputes about the conduct of the Mandate.

Even as a matter of interpretation pure and simple, we regard
this as too slender a foundation on which to seek to erect such a
conclusion. The second part of the clause is quite redundant, as
the Mavrommatis case bears witness. Moreover the Belgian
Mandate for East Africa was on all fours with that of the British
Mandate for Tanganyika. It would be quite absurd to suggest that
the second paragraph was designed to create a difference between the
one Mandate and the other. No reason has ever been advanced why
this should have been so. In any case the record shows that all that
happenéd was that the Tanganyika clause simply retained the
original form of the adjudication clause introduced and discussed
in connection with the statal rights of Members of the League,
and rights reserved for their nationals, and that in this form the
first part was intended to cover the statal rights of the Members,
and the second the rights of their nationals. All that happened
in the Tanganyika case was that these two parts were never merged,
as happened in all the other cases; or rather that there was simply
a failure to drop the second part, as being superfluous. From this,
no useful information as to the meaning of the first part can be
derived. In the circumstances, therefore, no deduction contrary
to the view we hold can legitimately be drawn.

Conclusion: we consider that the third preliminary objection is
good and should be upheld.


FOURTH PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

Having regard to our view, stated under the preceding head, that
the matters involved by the present Application are not of a kind

1 The reason for the failure to draft the Tanganyika clause in the same form as
the others has not been established with any certainty. It was one of those drafting
quirks that constantly occur at international conferences, and probably arose from
differences of view as to whether, if a clause is superfluous, it is better to omit it or,
ex abundanti cautela, to let it remain.



that are capable of settlement on the basis of a negotiation between
the Applicants and the Respondent State, since these parties lack
competence to settle such matters by a negotiation purely between
themselves, the question of whether the present dispute is one that
“cannot” be settled by negotiation hardly arises for us. We will
consider it nevertheless, because certain points of principle are
involved which seem to us important.

The Respondent has not denied that discussions have taken place
in the United Nations, but has confined itself to contending that
they did not take place in conditions that gave them any real
chance of success, so that it cannot be said that the dispute is one
that under no circumstances could be settled by negotiation.

This contention involves questions of fact into which we do not
propose to go because, in our opinion, there has not, properly speak-
ing, been any negotiation at all in this case of the kind contemplated
by Article 7.

Under Article 7, the dispute that cannot be settled by negotiation
must be the dispute between the Mandatory and the other Member
of the League concerned, i.e., the actual dispute between the Parties
to the proceedings before the Court, as such. This means that the
negotiation required by Article 7 must relate to that dispute and
no other. Now the Applications in this case were filed in November,
1960, and it is quite clear therefore that, up to that date, the
Assembly proceedings on which the Applicants rely (even if they
can be called negotiation at all) had nothing whatever to do with
the actual dispute between the Applicant States and the Respondent
State, since this dispute did not then exist as such 1. All that existed
up to that date was a disagreement between the Assembly (as an
entity) and one of its Members—the Respondent State; and all
that had taken place up to that date were sundry proceedings in
the Assembly and its Committees, in which indeed the Applicants
participated, but simply as Members of the Assembly. To attribute
to these antecedent discussions the character of a negotiation
relative to the present dispute (which only arose in November 1960,
if even then!)—a negotiation conducted by the Applicants in and
through the Assembly, or by the Assembly itself on behalf of the
Applicants, seems to us wholly unrealistic.

We would not wish to exaggerate the extent of negotiation that
may be required to establish that there has been the minimum

! Nor strictly does it exist now, since, as we pointed out under the preceding
head, it cannot have been created merely by the institution of proceedings; and no
other interchanges, outside the Assembly, or directly between the parties as such,
have ever taken place.



necessary in the circumstances to make it clear that the parties
cannot settle their dispute. But some negotiation must, we think,
in fact have taken place between the actual Parties to the proceed-
ings before the Court, in their capacity as individual States.

Furthermore, the negotiation must relate to the dispute (and no
other) alleged to exist between the parties to the proceedings before
the Court, which dispute must have existed antecedently to those
proceedings. It is not sufficient for the negotiation (supposing it to
have been one) to have related to a dispute which, at the time when
this ‘negotiation’ was taking place, did not exist specifically between
the Parties before the Court, but consisted merely in a general all-
round controversy pursued on the floor of an international Assembly.

We are not concerned to deny the propriety or utility of dis-
cussions in an international forum such as the Assembly of the
United Nations. We do not think that, normally, such discussions
can be regarded as an actual negotiation taking place between the
Parties before the Court, as we think Article 7 contemplated. Such
discussions are, and necessarily must be, of too general and diffused
a character to constitute a negotiation between the specific parties
who eventually come before the Court in relation to a specific
dispute between them as States.

Be that as it may, what is clearly apparent to us is that a “ne-
gotiation” confined to the floor of an international Assembly, consist-
ing of allegations of Members, resolutions of the Assembly and actions
taken by the assembly pursuant thereto, denial of allegations,
refusal to comply with resolutions or to respond to action taken
thereunder, cannot be enough to justify the Court in holding
that the dispute “cannot” be settled by negotiation, when no direct
diplomatic interchanges have ever taken place between the parties,
and therefore no attempt at settlement has been made at the statal
and diplomatic level. Since direct negotiations between the actual
Parties to a dispute constitute the usual and normally indispensable
method of attempting a settlement, we do not see how the Court
can hold and adjudge that the dispute (that any dispute) “cannot”
be settled, when no recourse at all has been had to this method.
We do not think it should be assumed or postulated that inter-
changes which have not succeeded in the Assembly or its subsidiary
organs, might not, in different conditions, and amongst a restricted
number of parties, stand some chance of success—at least a sufficient
chance to make it not reasonably possible to affirm the contrary
until this method has been attempted. Whether success would be
achieved, must be a matter of opinion, but that is not the point;
and to us, the failure to conduct, or even attempt, any direct ne-
gotiations between the parties to the present dispute in their
capacity as such, appears (having regard to the terms of Article 7)
to constitute a formal bar to the present proceedings.



In our opinion the fourth preliminary objection must accordingly
be upheld.

*

We shall conclude by pointing out that requirements about
“disputes” and ‘negotiations’ are not mere technicalities. They
appear in one form or another in virtually every adjudication
clause that has ever been drafted, and for good reason. They are
inserted purposely to protect the parties, so far as possible, from
international litigation that is unnecessary, premature, inadequately
motivated, or merely specious. Without this measure of protection,
countries would not sign clauses providing for compulsory adjudica-
tion. This is an aspect of the matter to which we feel insufficient
attention has been given.

*
* +

Our final conclusion on the whole case is that, for all of the
reasons stated, and in relation to each of the objections raised,
whether on the grounds actually advanced by the Respondent State
or on other grounds, the Court is not competent in this case, and
should refuse to assume jurisdiction.
