The Colombian Government has presented two submissions, of
which the first asks the Court to adjudge and declare

“That the Republic of Colombia, as the country granting asylum,
is competent to qualify the offence for the purpose of the said asylum,
within the limits of the obligations resulting in particular from the
Bolivarian Agreement on Extradition of July 18th, 1911, and the
Convention on Asylum of February zoth, 1928, and of American
international law in general.”

If the Colombian Government by this submission intended to
allege that Colombia, as the State granting asylum, is competent


to qualify the offence only provisionally and without binding
effect for Peru, the solution would not remain a matter of doubt.
It is evident that the diplomatic representative who has to
determine whether a refugee is to be granted asylum or not must
have the competence to make such a provisional qualification
of any offence alleged to have been committed by the refugee.
He must in fact examine the question whether the conditions
required for granting asylum are fulfilled. The territorial State
would not thereby be deprived of its right to contest the quali-
fication. In case of disagreement between the two States, a dispute
would arise which might be settled by the methods provided
by the Parties for the settlement of their disputes.

This is not, however, the meaning which the Colombian Govern-
ment has put on its submission. It has not claimed the right of
qualification for the sole purpose of determining its own conduct.
The written and oral arguments. submitted on behalf of that
Government show that its claim must be understood in the sense
that Colombia, as the State granting asylum, is competent to
qualify the nature of the offence by a unilateral and definitive
decision binding on Peru. Colombia has based this submission
partly on rules resulting from agreement, partly on an alleged
custom.

The Colombian Government has referred to the Bolivarian
Agreement of 1911, Article 18, which is framed in the following
terms :

“Aside from the stipulations of the present Agreement, the
signatory States recognize the institution of asylum in conformity
with the principles of international law.”

In recognizing “the institution of asylum”, this article merely
refers to the principles of international law. But the principles
of international law do not recognize any rule of unilateral and
definitive qualification by the State granting diplomatic asylum.

The Colombian Government has also relied on Article 4 of this
Agreement concerning extradition of a criminal refugee from the
territory of the State in which he has sought refuge. The arguments
submitted in this respect reveal a confusion between territorial
asylum (extradition), on the one hand, and diplomatic asylum,
on the other.

In the case of extradition, the refugee is within the territory
of the State of refuge. A decision with regard to extradition
implies only the normal exercise of the territorial sovereignty.
The refugee is outside the territory of the State where the offence
was committed, and a decision to grant him asylum in no way
derogates from the sovereignty of that State.

In the case of diplomatic asylum, the refugee is within the
territory of the State where the offence was committed. A decision
to grant diplomatic asylum involves a derogation from the



sovereignty of that State. It withdraws the offender from the
jurisdiction of the territorial State and constitutes an intervention
in matters which are exclusively within the competence of that
State. Such a derogation from territorial sovereignty cannot be
recognized unless its legal basis is established in each particular
case.

For these reasons, it is not possible to deduce from the provisions
of agreements concerning extradition any conclusion which would
apply to the question now under consideration.

The Colombian Government further relies on the Havana Con-
vention on Asylum of 1928. This Convention lays down certain
rules relating to diplomatic asylum, but does not contain any
provision conferring on the State granting asylum a unilateral
competence to qualify the offence with definitive. and binding
force for the territorial State. The Colombian Government contends,
however, that such a competence is implied in that Convention
and is inherent in the institution of asylum.

A competence of this kind is of an exceptional character. It
involves a derogation from the equal rights of qualification which,
in the absence of any contrary rule, must be attributed to each
of the States concerned ; it thus aggravates the derogation from
territorial sovereignty constituted by the exercise of asylum.
Such a competence is not inherent in the institution of diplomatic
asylum. This institution would perhaps be more effective if a
rule of unilateral and definitive qualification were applied. But
such a rule is not essential to the exercise of asylum.

These considerations show that the alleged right of unilateral
and definitive qualification cannot be regarded as recognized by
implication in the Havana Convention. Moreover, this Convention,
in pursuance of the desire expressed in its preamble of “fixing
the rules” which the Governments of the States of America must
observe for the granting of asylum, was concluded with the
manifest intention of preventing the abuses which had arisen in
the previous practice, by limiting the grant of asylum. It did so
in a number of ways and in terms which are unusually restrictive
and emphatic (“It is not permissible for States...” ; “Asylum
may not be granted except in urgent cases and for the period of
time strictly indispensable....”, etc.).

The Colombian Government has invoked Article 2, paragraph I,
of the Havana Convention, which is framed in the following
terms :

“Asylum granted to political offenders in legations, warships,
military camps or military aircraft, shall be respected to the extent
in which allowed as a right or through humanitarian toleration,
by the usages, the conventions or the laws of the country in which
granted and in accordance with the following provisions :”



This provision has been interpreted by that Government in the
sense that the usages, conventions and laws of Colombia relating to
the qualification of the offence can be invoked against Peru. This
interpretation, which would mean that the extent of the obligation
of one of the signatory States would depend upon any modifications
which might occur in the law of another, cannot be accepted. The
provision must be regarded as a limitation of the extent to which
asylum shall be respected. What the provision says in effect is that
the State of refuge shall not exercise asylum to a larger extent than
is warranted by its own usages, conventions or laws and that the
asylum granted must be respected by the territorial State only
where such asylum would be permitted according to the usages,
conventions or laws of the State of refuge, Nothing therefore
can be deduced from this provision in so far as qualification is
concerned.

The Colombian Government has further referred to the Monte-
video Convention on Political Asylum of 1933. It was in fact this
Convention which was invoked in the note of January 14th, 1949,
from the Colombian Ambassador to the Peruvian Minister for
Foreign Affairs. It is argued that, by Article 2 of that Convention,
the Havana Convention of 1028 is interpreted in the sense that the
qualification of a political offence appertains to the State granting
asylum. Articles 6 and 7 of the Montevideo Convention provide that
it shall be ratified and will enter into force as and when the ratifi-
cations are deposited. The Montevideo Convention has not been
ratified by Peru, and cannot be invoked against that State. The
fact that it was considered necessary to incorporate in that Conven-
tion an article accepting the right of unilateral qualification, seems to
indicate that this solution was regarded as a new rule not recognized
by the Havana Convention. Moreover, the preamble of the Monte-
video Convention states in its Spanish, French and Portuguese
texts that it modifies the Havana Convention. It cannot therefore
be considered as representing merely an interpretation of that
Convention.

The Colombian Government has finally invoked “American
international law in general”. In addition to the rules arising from
agreements which have already been considered, it has relied on an
alleged regional or local custom peculiar to Latin-American States.

The Party which relies on a custom of this kind must prove
that this custom is established in such a manner that it has become
binding on the other Party. The Colombian Government must
prove that the rule invoked by it is in accordance with a constant
and uniform usage practised by the States in question, and that
this usage is the expression of a right appertaining to the State
granting asylum and a duty incumbent on the territorial State. This
follows from Article 38 of the Statute of the Court, which refers to



international custom ‘‘as evidence of a general practice accepted
as law”.

In support of its contention concerning the existence of such a
custom, the Colombian Government has referred to a large number .
of extradition treaties which, as already explained, can have no
bearing on the question now under consideration. It has cited
conventions and agreements which do not contain any provision
concerning the alleged rule of unilateral and definitive qualification
such as the Montevideo Convention of 1889 on international penal
law, the Bolivarian Agreement of 1911 and the Havana Convention
of 1928. It has invoked conventions which have not been ratified by
Peru, such as the Montevideo Conventions of 1933 and 1939. The
Convention of 1933 has, in fact, been ratified by not more than
eleven States and the Convention of 1939 by two States only.

It is particularly the Montevideo Convention of 1933 which
Counsel for the Colombian Government has also relied on in this
connexion. Ît is contended that this Convention has merely codified
principles which were already recognized by Latin-American
custom, and that it is valid against Peru as a proof of customary
law. The limited number of States which have ratified this Conven-
tion reveals the weakness of this argument, and furthermore, it is
invalidated by the preamble which states that this Convention
modifies the Havana Convention.

Finally, the Colombian Government has referred to a large
number of particular cases in which diplomatic asylum was in fact
granted and respected. But it has not shown that the alleged rule
of unilateral and definitive qualification was invoked or—if in some
cases it was in fact invoked—that it was, apart from conventional
stipulations, exercised by the States granting asylum as a right
appertaining to them and respected by the territorial States as a
duty incumbent on them and not merely for reasons of political
expediency. The facts brought to the knowledge of the Court
disclose so much uncertainty and contradiction, so much fluctuation
and discrepancy in the exercise of diplomatic asylum and in the
official views expressed on various occasions, there has been so much
inconsistency in the rapid succession of conventions on asylum,
ratified by some States and rejected by others, and the practice
has been so much influenced by considerations of political expediency
in the various cases, that it is not possible to discern in all this any
constant and uniform usage, accepted as law, with regard to the
alleged rule of unilateral and definitive qualification of the offence.

The Court cannot therefore find that the Colombian Government
has proved the existence of such a custom. But even if it could be
supposed that such a custom existed between certain Latin-Ameri-
can States only, it could not be invoked against Peru which, far



from having by its attitude adhered to it, has, on the contrary,
repudiated it by refraining from ratifying the Montevideo Conven-
tions of 1933 and 1939, which were the first to include a rule concern-
ing the qualification of the offence in matters of diplomatic asylum.
In the written Pleadings and during the oral proceedings, the
Government of Colombia relied upon official communiqués published
by the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 13th
and 26th, 1948, and the Government of Peru relied upon a Report
of the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Colombia dated September 2nd, 1937; on the question of
qualification, these documents state views which are contrary to
those now maintained by these Governments. The Court, whose
duty it is to apply international law in deciding the present case,
cannot attach decisive importance to any of these documents.

For these reasons, the Court has arrived at the conclusion that
Colombia, as the State granting asylum, is not competent to
qualify the offence by a unilateral and definitive decision, binding
on Peru.

In its second submission, the Colombian Government asks the
Court to adjudge and declare:

“That the Republic of Peru, as the territorial State, is bound in
the case now before the Court, to give the guarantees necessary
for the departure of M. Victor Raul Haya de la Torre from the
country, with due regard to the inviolability of his person.”

This alleged obligation of the Peruvian Government does not
entirely depend on the answer. given to the first Colombian sub-
mission relating to. the unilateral and definitive qualification of
the offence. It follows from the first two articles of the Havana
Convention that, even if such a right of qualification is not
admitted, the Colombian Government is entitled to request a
safe-conduct under certain conditions. ’

The first condition is that asylum has been regularly granted
and maintained. It can be granted only to political offenders
who are not accused or condemned for common crimes and only
in urgent cases and for the time strictly indispensable for the
safety of the refugee. These points relate to the Peruvian counter-
claim and will be considered later to the extent necessary for
the decision of the present case.

The second condition 1s laid down in Article 2 of the Havana
Convention :



“Third : The Government of the State may require that the
refugee be sent out of the national territory within the shortest
time possible ; and the diplomatic agent of the country who has
granted asylum may in turn require the guarantees necessary for
the departure of the refugee from the country with due regard to
the inviolability of his person.”

If regard is had, on the one. hand, to the structure of this
provision which indicates a successive order, and, on the other
hand, to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words “in
turn”, this provision can only mean that the territorial State
may require that the refugee be sent out of the country, and
that only after such a demand can the State granting asylum
require the necessary guarantees as a condition of his being sent
out, The provision gives, in other words, the territorial State
an option to require the departure of the refugee, and that State
becomes bound to grant a safe-conduct only if it has exercised
this option.

A contrary interpretation would lead, in the case now before
the Court, to the conclusion that Colombia would be entitled
to decide alone whether the conditions provided by Articles 1
and 2 of the Convention for the regularity of asylum are fulfilled.
Such a consequence obviously would be incompatible with the
legal situation created by the Convention.

There exists undoubtedly a practice whereby the diplomatic
representative who grants asylum immediately requests a safe-
conduct without awaiting a request from the territorial State
for the departure of the refugee. This procedure meets certain
requirements : the diplomatic agent is naturally desirous that the
presence of the refugee on his premises should not be prolonged ;
and the government of the country, for its part, desires in a great
number of cases that its political opponent who has obtained asylum
should depart. This concordance of views suffices to explain the
practice which has been noted in this connexion, but this practice
does not and cannot mean that the State, to whom such a request
for a safe-conduct has been addressed, is legally bound to accede
to it.

In the present case, the Peruvian Government has not requested
that Haya de la Torre should leave Peru. It has contested the
legality of the asylum granted to him and has refused to deliver a
safe-conduct. In such circumstances the Colombian Government is
not entitled to claim that the Peruvian Government should give the
guarantees necessary for the departure of Haya de la Torre from the
country, with due regard to the inviolability of his person.

The counter-claim of the Government of Peru was stated in its
final form during the oral statement of October 3rd, 1950, in the
following terms :



“MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT:

To adjudge and declare as a counter-claim under Article 63
of the Rules of Court, and in the same decision, that the grant
of asylum by the Colombian Ambassador at Lima to Victor Rail
Haya de la Torre was made in violation of Article 1, paragraph I,
and Article 2, paragraph 2, item I (inciso primero), of the Con-
vention on Asylum signed in 1928, and that in any case the
maintenance of the asylum constitutes at the present time a
violation of that treaty.”

As has already been pointed out, the last part of this sentence :
“and that in any case the maintenance of the asylum constitutes
at the present time a violation of that treaty”, did not appear in
the counter-claim presented by the Government of Peru in the
Counter-Memorial. The addition was only made during the oral
proceedings. The Court will first consider the counter-claim in its
original form.

This counter-claim is intended, in substance, to put an end to the
dispute by requesting the Court to declare that asylum was wrong-
fully given, the grant of asylum being contrary to certain provisions
of the Havana Convention. The object of the counter-claim is
simply to define for this purpose the legal relations which that
Convention has established between Colombia and Peru. The Court
observes in this connexion that the question of the possible surren-
der of the refugee to the territorial authorities is in no way raised
in the counter-claim. It points out that the Havana Convention,
which provides for the surrender to those authorities of persons
accused of or condemned for common crimes, contains no similar
provision in respect of political offenders. The Court notes, finally,
that this question was not raised either in the diplomatic correspon-
dence submitted by the Parties or at any moment in the procee-
dings before the Court, and in fact the Government of Peru has
not requested that the refugee should be surrendered.

It results from the final submissions of the Government of
Colombia, as formulated before the Court on October 6th, 1950,
that that Government did not contest the jurisdiction of the
Court in respect of the original counter-claim ; it did so only in
respect of the addition made during the oral proceedings. On the
other hand, relying upon Article 63 of the Rules of Court, the
Government of Colombia has disputed the admissibility of the
counter-claim by arguing that it is not directly connected with the
subject-matter of the Application. In its view, this lack of connexion
results from the fact that the counter-claim raises new problems and
thus tends to shift the grounds of the dispute.

The Court is unable to accept this view. It emerges clearly from
the arguments of the Parties that the second submission of the
Government of Colombia, which concerns the demand for a safe-
conduct, rests largely on the alleged regularity of the asylum, which
is precisely what is disputed by the counter-claim. The connexion
is so direct that certain conditions which are required to exist
before a safe-conduct can be demanded depend precisely on facts



which are raised by the counter-claim. The direct connexion being
thus clearly established, the sole objection to the admissibility of
the counter-claim in its original form is therefore removed.

Before examining the question whether the counter-claim is well
founded, the Court must state in precise terms what meaning it
attaches to the words ‘the grant of asylum’ which are used therein.
The grant of asylum is not an instantaneous act which terminates
with the admission, at a given moment, of a refugee to an embassy
or a legation. Any grant of asylum results in, and in consequence
logically implies, a state of protection ; the asylum is granted as
long as the continued presence of the refugee in the embassy
prolongs this protection. This view, which results from the very
nature of the institution of asylum, is further confirmed by the
attitude of the Parties during this case. The counter-claim, as it
appears in the Counter-Memorial of the Government of Peru,
refers expressly to Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Havana Convention,
which provides that asylum may not be granted except ‘for the
period of time strictly indispensable”. Such has also been the view
of the Government of Colombia ; its Reply shows that, in its opinion,
as in that of the Government of Peru, the reference to the above-
mentioned provision of the Havana Convention raises the question
of ‘“the duration of the refuge”.

The Government of Peru has based its counter-claim on two
different grounds which correspond respectively to Article 1, para-
graph 1, and Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Havana Convention.

Under Article 1, paragraph 1,‘ It is not permissible for States to
grant asylum .... to persons accused or condemned for common
crimes....”. The onus of proving that Haya de la Torre had been
accused or condemned for common crimes before the grant of
asylum rested upon Peru.

The Court has no difficulty in finding, in the present case, that
the refugee was an “accused person’ within the meaning of the
Havana Convention, inasmuch as the evidence presented by the
Government of Peru appears conclusive in this connexion. It
can hardly be agreed that the term “accused” occurring in a
multilateral treaty such as that of Havana has a precise and
technical connotation, which would have the effect of subordinating
the definition of “accused” to the completion of certain strictly
prescribed steps in procedure, which might differ from one legal
system to another.

On the other hand, the Court considers that the Government of
Peru has not proved that the acts of which the refugee was accused
before January 3rd/4th, 1949, constitute common crimes. From
the point of view of the application of the Havana Convention, it
is the terms of the accusation, as formulated by the legal authorities
before the grant of asylum, that must alone be considered. As has
been shown in the recital of the facts, the sole accusation contained
in all the documents emanating from the Peruvian legal authorities



is that of military rebellion, and the Government of Peru has not
established that military rebellion in itself constitutes a common
crime. Article 248 of the Peruvian Code of Military Justice of
1939 even tends to prove the contrary, for it makes a distinction
between military rebellion and common crimes by providing that :
“Common crimes committed during the course of, and in connexion
with, a rebellion, shall be punishable in conformity with the laws,
irrespective of the rebellion.”

These considerations lead to the conclusion that the first objection
made by the Government of Peru against the asylum is not justified
and that on this point the counter-claim is not well founded and
must be dismissed.

The Government of Peru relies, as a second basis for its counter-
claim, upon the alleged disregard of Article 2, paragraph 2, of the
Havana Convention, which provides as follows: “Asylum may
not be granted except in urgent cases and for the period of time
strictly indispensable for the person who has sought asylum to
ensure in some other way his safety.”

Before proceeding to an examination of this provision, the
Court considers it necessary to make the following remark con-
cerning the Havana Convention in general and Article 2 in
particular.

The object of the Havana Convention, which is the only agree-
ment relevant to the present case, was, as indicated in its preamble,
to fix the rules which the signatory States must observe for the
granting of asylum in their mutual relations. The intention was,
as has been stated above, to put an end to the abuses which
had arisen in the practice of asylum and which were likely to
impair its credit and usefulness. This is borne out by the wording
of Articles x and 2 of the Convention which is at times prohibitive
and at times clearly restrictive.

Article 2 refers to asylum granted to political offenders and
lays down in precise terms the conditions under which asylum
granted to such offenders shall be respected by the territorial
State. It is worthy of note that all these conditions are designed
to give guarantees to the territorial State and appear, in the
final analysis, as the consideration for the obligation which that
State assumes to respect asylum, that is, to accept its principle
and its consequences as long as it is regularly maintained.

At the head of the list of these conditions appears Article 2,
paragraph 2, quoted above. It is certainly the most important
of them, the essential justification for asylum being in the immi-
nence or persistence of a danger for the person of the refugee.
It was incumbent upon the Government of Colombia to submit
proof of facts to show that the above-mentioned condition was
fulfilled.

It has not been disputed by the Parties that asylum may be
granted on humanitarian grounds in order to protect political
offenders against the violent and disorderly action of irresponsible



sections of the population. It has not been contended by the
Government of Colombia that Haya de la Torre was in such a
situation at the time when he sought refuge in the Colombian
Embassy at Lima. At that time, three months had elapsed since
the military rebellion. This long interval gives the present case
a very special character. During those three months, Haya de la
Torre had apparently been in hiding in the country, refusing to
obey the summons to appear of the legal authorities which was
published on November 16th/18th, 1948, and refraining from
seeking asylum in the foreign embassies where several of his
co-accused had found refuge before these dates. It was only on
January 3rd, 1949, that he sought refuge in the Colombian Em-
bassy. The Court considers that, prima facie, such circumstances
make it difficult to speak of urgency.

The diplomatic correspondence between the two Governments
does not indicate the nature of the danger which was alleged to
threaten the refugee. Likewise, the Memorial of the Government
of Colombia confines itself to stating that the refugee begged
the Ambassador to grant him the diplomatic protection of asylum
as his freedom and life were in jeopardy. It is only in the written
Reply that the Government of Colombia described in more precise
terms the nature of the danger against which the refugee intended
to request the protection of the Ambassador. It was then claimed
that this danger resulted in particular from the abnormal political
situation existing in Peru, following the state of siege proclaimed
on October 4th, 1048, and renewed successively on November 2nd,
December 2nd, 1948, and January 2nd, 1949; that it further
resulted from the declaration of ‘‘a state of national crisis” made
on October 25th, 1948, containing various statements against the
American People’s Revolutionary Alliance of which the refugee
was the head; from the outlawing of this Party by the decree
of October 4th, 1948; from the Order issued by the acting
Examining Magistrate for the Navy on November 13th, 1048,
requiring the defaulters to be cited by public summons; from
the decree of November 4th, 1048, providing for Courts-Martial
to judge summarily, with the option of increasing the penalties
and without appeal, the authors, accomplices and others respon-
sible for the offences of rebellion, sedition or mutiny.

From these facts regarded as a whole the nature of the danger
now becomes clear, and it is upon the urgent character of such a
danger that the Government of Colombia seeks to justify the
asylum—the danger of political justice by reason of the subordin-
ation of the Peruvian judicial authorities to the instructions of
the Executive,

It is therefore necessary to examine whether, and, if so, to what
extent, a danger of this kind can serve as a basis for asylum.



In principle, it is inconceivable that the Havana Convention
could have intended the term “urgent cases” to include the danger
of regular prosecution to which the citizens of any country lay them-
selves open by attacking the institutions of that country ; nor can
it be admitted that in referring to ‘the period of time strictly
indispensable for the person who has sought asylum to ensure in
some other way his safety”, the Convention envisaged protection
from the operation of regular legal proceedings.

It would be useless to seek an argument to the contrary in
Article I of the Havana Convention which forbids the grant of
asylum to persons ‘‘accused or condemned for common crimes” and
directs that such persons shall be surrendered immediately upon
request of the local government. It is not possible to infer from that
provision that, because a person is accused of political offences and
not of common crimes, he is, by that fact alone, entitled to asylum.
It is clear that such an inference would disregard the requirements
laid down by Article 2, paragraph 2, for the grant of asylum to
political offenders.

In principle, therefore, asylum cannot be opposed to the operation
of justice. An exception to this rule can occur only if, in the guise
of justice, arbitrary action is substituted for the rule of law. Such
would be the case if the administration of justice were corrupted by
measures clearly prompted by political aims. Asylum protects the
political offender against any measures of a manifestly extra-legal
character which a government might take or attempt to take against
its political opponents. The word “safety”, which in Article 2,
paragraph 2, determines the specific effect of asylum granted to
political offenders, means that the refugee is protected against
arbitrary action by the government, and that he enjoys the benefits
of the law. On the other hand, the safety which arises out of asylum
cannot be construed as a protection against the regular application
of the laws and against the jurisdiction of legally constituted tribu-
nals. Protection thus understood would authorize the diplomatic
agent to obstruct the application of the laws of the country whereas
it is his duty to respect them ; it would in fact become the equiva-
lent of an immunity, which was evidently not within the intentions
of the draftsmen of the Havana Convention.

It is true that successive decrees promulgated by the Government
of Peru proclaimed and prolonged a state of siege in that country ;
but it has not been shown that the existence of a state of siege
implied the subordination of justice to the executive authority, or
that the suspension of certain constitutional guarantees entailed the
abolition of judicial guarantees. As for the decree of November 4th,
1948, providing for Courts-Martial, it contained no indication which
might be taken to mean that the new provisions would apply
retroactively to offences committed prior to the publication of the
said decree. In fact, this decree was not applied to the legal proceed-
ings against Haya de la Torre, as appears from the foregoing recital



of the facts. As regards the future, the Court places on record the
following declaration made on behalf of the Peruvian Government :

“The decree in question is dated November 4th, 1948, that
is, it was enacted one month after the events which led to the
institution of proceedings against Haya de la Torre. This decree
was intended to apply to crimes occurring after its publication,
and nobody in Peru would ever have dreamed of utilizing it in
the case to which the Colombian Government clumsily refers,
since the principle that laws have no retroactive effect, especially
in penal matters, is broadly admitted in that decree. If the
Colombian Government's statement on this point were true, the
Peruvian Government would never have referred this case to
the International Court of Justice.”

This declaration, which appears in the Rejoinder, was confirmed
by the Agent for the Government of Peru in his oral statement of
October 2nd, 1950.

The Court cannot admit that the States signatory to the Havana
Convention intended to substitute for the practice of the Latin-
American republics, in which considerations of courtesy, good-
neighbourliness and political expediency have always held a promi-
nent place, a legal system which would guarantee to their own
nationals accused of political offences the privilege of evading
national jurisdiction. Such a conception, moreover, would come into
conflict with one of the most firmly established traditions of Latin
America, namely, non-intervention. It was at the Sixth Pan-
American Conference of 1928, during which the Convention on
Asylum was signed, that the States of Latin America declared their
resolute opposition to any foreign political intervention. It would
be difficult to conceive that these same States had consented, at the
very same moment, to submit to intervention in its least acceptable
form, one which implies foreign interference in the administration
of domestic justice and which could not manifest itself without
casting some doubt on the impartiality of that justice.

Indeed the diplomatic correspondence between the two Govern-
ments shows the constant anxiety of Colombia to remain, in this
field as elsewhere, faithful to the tradition of non-intervention.
Colombia did not depart from this attitude, even when she found
herself confronted with an emphatic declaration by the Peruvian
Minister for Foreign Affairs asserting that the tribunal before which
Haya de la Torre had been summoned to appear was in conformity
with the general and permanent organization of Peruvian judicial
administration and under the control of the Supreme Court. This
assertion met with no contradiction or reservation on the part of
Colombia. It was only much later, following the presentation of the
Peruvian counter-claim, that the Government of Colombia chose,



in the Reply ‘and during the oral proceedings, to transfer the
defence of asylum to a plane on which the Havana Convention,
interpreted in the light of the most firmly established traditions of
Latin America, could provide it with no foundation.

The foregoing considerations lead us to reject the argument that
the Havana Convention was intended to afford a quite general
protection of asylum to any person prosecuted for political offences,
either in the course of revolutionary events, or in the more or
less troubled times that follow, for the sole reason that it must be
assumed that such events interfere with the administration of
justice. It is clear that the adoption of such a criterion would lead
to foreign interference of a particularly offensive nature in the
domestic affairs of States ; besides which, no confirmation of this
criterion can be found in Latin-American practice, as this practice
has been explained to the Court.

In thus expressing itself, the Court does not lose sight of the
numerous cases of asylum which have been cited in the Reply
of the Government of Colombia and during the oral state-
ments. In this connexion, the following observations should be
made :

In the absence of precise data, it is difficult to assess the value
of such cases as precedents tending to establish the existence of
a legal obligation upon a territorial State to recognize the validity
of asylum which has been granted against proceedings instituted
by local judicial authorities. The facts which have been laid
before the Court show that in a number of cases the persons who
have enjoyed asylum were not, at the moment at which asylum
was granted, the object of any accusation on the part of the
judicial authorities. In a more general way, considerations of
convenience or simple political expediency seem to have led the
territorial State to recognize asylum without that decision being
dictated by any feeling of legal obligation.

If these remarks tend to reduce considerably the value as
precedents of the cases of asylum cited by the Government of
Colombia, they show, none the less, that asylum as practised in
Latin America is an institution which, to a very great extent,
owes its development to extra-legal factors. The good-neighbour
relations between the republics, the different political interests
of the governments, have favoured the mutual recognition of
asylum apart from any clearly defined juridical system. Even if
the Havana Convention, in particular, represents an indisputable
reaction against certain abuses in practice, it in no way tends to
limit the practice of asylum as it may arise from agreements
between interested governments inspired by mutual feelings of
toleration and goodwill.



In conclusion, on the basis of the foregoing observations and
considerations, the Court considers that on January 3rd/4th, 1949,
there did not exist a danger constituting a case of urgency within
the meaning of Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Havana Convention.

This finding implies no criticism of the Ambassador of Colombia.
His decision to receive the refugee on the evening of January 3rd,
1949, may have been taken without the opportunity of lengthy
reflection ; it may have been influenced as much by the previous
grant of safe-conducts to persons accused together with Haya de
la Torre as by the more general consideration of recent events in
Peru ; these events may have led him to believe in the existence
of urgency. But this subjective appreciation is not the relevant
element in the decision which the Court is called upon to take
concerning the validity of the asylum ; the only important question
to be considered here is the objective existence of the facts, and it
is this which must determine the decision of the Court.

The notes of the Ambassador of Colombia of January 14th and
February 12th, 1949, reflect the attitude of the Government towards
the asylum granted by its Ambassador. The first of these confirms
the asylum and claims to justify its grant by a unilateral qualifica-
tion of the refugee. The second formulates a demand for a safe-
conduct with a view to permitting the departure of the refugee,
and has based this demand expressly on the “international obliga-
tions’ alleged to be binding on the Government of Peru. In thus
expressing itself, the Government of Colombia definitively pro-
claimed its intention of protecting Haya de la Torre, in spite of
the existence of proceedings instituted against him for military
rebellion. It has maintained this attitude and this protection by
continuing to insist on the grant of a safe-conduct, even when the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru referred to the existence of
“a judicial prosecution, instituted by the sovereign power of the
State” against the refugee (notes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Peru of March 19th, 1949 ; of the Ambassador of Colombia of
March 28th, 1949).

Thus, it is clearly apparent from this correspondence that the
Court, in its appraisal of the asylum, cannot be confined to the
date of January 3rd/4th, 1940, as the date on which it was granted.
The grant, as has been stated above, is inseparable from the pro-
tection to which it gives rise—a protection which has here assumed
the form of a defence against legal proceedings. It therefore results
that asylum has been granted for as long as the Government of
Colombia has relied upon it in support of its request for a safe-
conduct.

The Court is thus led to find that the grant of asylum from
January 3rd/4th, 1949, until the time when the two Governments
agreed to submit the dispute to its jurisdiction, has been prolonged
for a reason which is not recognized by Article 2, paragraph 2,
of the Havana Convention.

FOR THESE REASONS,

THE COURT,

on the submissions of the Government of Colombia,
by fourteen votes to two,

Rejects the first submission in so far as it involves a right for
Colombia, as the country granting asylum, to qualify the nature
of the offence by a unilateral and definitive decision, binding on
Peru ;

by fifteen votes to one,

Rejects the second submission ;

on the counter-claim of the Government of Peru,
by fifteen votes to one,

Rejects it in so far as it is founded on a violation of Article 1,
paragraph 1, of the Convention on Asylum signed at Havana in
1928 ;

by ten votes to six,

Finds that the grant of asylum by the Colombian Government to
Victor Raûl Haya de la Torre was not made in conformity with
Article 2, paragraph 2 (‘First’), of that Convention.
