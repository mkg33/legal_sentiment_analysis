Judge WELLINGTON KOO makes the following Declaration:

Since some of the grounds given in the Judgment relate to the
decision of the Court in the case of the Aerial Incident-of July 27th,
1955 (Israel v. Bulgaria}, Preliminary Objections, 1 desire to say
that while I concur in the conclusion of the Court in the present
case and generally in the reasoning which leads to it, I do not
mean thereby to imply that I now concur or acquiesce in that
decision but that, on the contrary, I continue to hold the views
and the conclusion stated in the Joint Dissenting Opinion appended
to that decision.

Indeed, I consider that on the basis of that Opinion Thailand's
1940 Declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Permanent Court must be deemed to have been transformed, as
had also admittedly been intended by Thailand, when she became
a Member of the United Nations and therefore a party to the
Statute on 16 December 1946, by operation of Article 36, para-
graph 5, of the Statute, into an acceptance in relation to the
present Court; and this fact constitutes an additional and simpler
reason to meet Thailand’s principal argument in support of her first
objection.

This is clear, although it is equally true that since the circum-
stances of the two cases are essentially different, neither the fact,
based on the said Opinion, that the said 1940 Declaration had been
so transformed prior to its own terminal date, 6 May 1950, nor
the fact, based upon the said 1959 decision of the Court, that it
had lapsed on 1g April 1946 when the Permanent Court was
dissolved, bears any determining legal effect on the only crucial
question at issue in the present case, namely, the validity of
Thailand’s Declaration of 20 May 1950.

Judge Sir Gerald FITZMAURICE and Judge TANAKA make the
following Joint Declaration:

Although we are in complete agreement with the substantive
conclusion of the Court in this case and with the reasoning on
which it is based, we have an additional and, for us, a more im-
mediate reason for rejecting the first preliminary objection of
Thailand.

This preliminary objection is based on the conclusion concerning
the effect of paragraph 5 of Article 36 of the Statute which the
