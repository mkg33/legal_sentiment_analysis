(1) the general configuration of the coasts of the Parties, as well as the
presence of any special or unusual features;

(2) so far as known or readily ascertainable, the physical and geological
structure, and natural resources, of the continental shelf areas in-
volved;

(3) the element of a reasonable degree of proportionality, which a delimi-
tation carried out in accordance with equitable principles ought to
bring about between the extent of the continental shelf areas apper-
taining to the coastal State and the length of its coast measured in
the general direction of the coastline, account being taken for this
purpose of the effects, actual or prospective, of any other continental
shelf delimitations between adjacent States in the same region.

I am in agreement with the Judgment throughout but would wish to
add the following observations.

The essence of the dispute between the Parties is that the two Kingdoms
claim that the delimitation effected between them under the Agreement
of 31 March 1966 is binding upon the Federal Republic and that the
Federal Republic is bound to accept the situation resulting therefrom,
which would confine its continental shelf to the triangle formed by lines
ABE and C-D-E in Map 3. The Federal Republic stoutly resists that
claim.

Not only is Article 6 of the Geneva Convention of 1958 not opposable
to the Federal Republic but the delimitation effected under the Agree-
ment of 31 March 1966 does not derive from the provisions of that Article
as Denmark and the Netherlands are neither States “whose coasts are
opposite each other” within the meaning of the first paragraph of that
Article nor are they “two adjacent States” within the meaning of the



second paragraph of that Article. The situation resulting from that delimi-
tation, so far as it affects the Federal Republic is not, therefore, brought
about by the application of the principle set out in either of the paragraphs
of Article 6 of the Convention.

Had paragraph 2 of Article 6 been applicable to the delimitation of
the continental shelf between the Parties to the dispute, a boundary line,
determined by the application of the principle of equidistance, would
have had to allow for the configuration of the coastline of the Federal
Republic as a “special circumstance”.

In the course of the oral pleadings the contention that the principle
of equidistance cum special circumstances had crystallized into a rule of
customary international law was not advanced on behalf of the two
Kingdoms as an alternative to the claim that that principle was inherent
in the very concept of the continental shelf. The Judgment has, in fair-
ness, dealt with these two contentions as if they had been put forward
in the alternative and were thus consistent with each other, and has
rejected each of them on the merits. I am in agreement with the reasoning
of the Judgment on both these points. But, I consider, it is worth men-

If it were correct that the doctrine of the coastal State’s exclusive
rights over the adjacent continental shelf was in process of formation



between 1945 and 1958 and that in State practice prior to 1958 it was
wholly lacking in any definition of crucial elements as it was also of the
legal régime applicable to the coastal State with respect to the continental
shelf, then it would seem to follow conclusively that the principle of
equidistance was not inherent in the concept of the continental shelf.

I regret my inability to concur with the main conclusions of the
majority of the Court. T agree with my colleagues who maintain the view
that Article 6 of the Geneva Convention is the applicable international
law and that as between these Parties equidistance is the rule for delimita-
tion, which rule may even be derived from the general principles of law.
