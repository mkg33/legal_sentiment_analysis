The contentious jurisdiction of the Court has been limited from the out-
set of its existence in 1922 to the cases which the parties submit to it, by
whatever means. This has been the law of the matter since the Council of
the League of Nations struck from the draft of the Court’s Statute the pro-
vision for general compulsory jurisdiction proposed by the Advisory
Committee of Jurists. Inthe development of that law, the Court has shown
great care not to find that it has jurisdiction where jurisdiction is question-
able. In its long and complex history of jurisdictional controversy, a his-
tory which is unique among courts, the Court has rarely departed from
this tradition of judicial caution. Its reasons have been prudential as well
as constitutional. Not only is it legally not entitled to assert jurisdiction
over States which have not assented to it; doing so, or appearing to do so,
in questionable cases may persuade States that a measured submission to
the Court’s jurisdiction may be interpreted as unmeasured, with the result
that they may abstain altogether from adhering to the Court’s jurisdiction.
The reality of this apprehension has been demonstrated more than once.
It may be, as Elihu Lauterpacht maintains in Aspects of the Administration
of International Justice (1991), that, because of developments in the juris-
prudence of the Court, in the practice of the Security Council of the
United Nations, and elsewhere, the time is ripe for reconsideration of the
traditional position that the jurisdiction of the Court is consensual rather
than compulsory. But as yet such a fundamental reconsideration has not
taken place.

The jurisdictional problems posed in bilateral disputes are magnified in
multilateral disputes. But, in contrast to the rich body of jurisdictional
practice in bilateral disputes, the cases in which the Court has addressed
situations analogous to that now before the Court are few. Where more
than one State is charged with joint (or joint and several) commission of an
act wrongful under international law, but only one such State is before the
Court, may the Court proceed to exercise jurisdiction over that State even
though its determination of the liability of that State may or will entail the
effective determination of the liability of another? That is the essence of
the problem which the Court must resolve if it is to find that it has jurisdic-
tion in the instant case and that that case is admissible.

In dealing with that problem, private law sources and analogies are of
little use. There is no doubt that, in the municipal law of States, a party
may maintain suit against a joint tortfeasor or co-contractor or co-trustee



in the absence of other joint tortfeasors, contractors, or trustees. But juris-
diction is not consensual in national law ; the situation differs fundamen-
tally from that which governs international jurisdiction, from which it
foliows that principles and patterns of national practice in this instance
have scant application to the issue before the Court.

The problem might have been dealt with by the Court in the
Corfu Channel case but it was not. The Memorial of the United Kingdom
contended “that the Albanian Government . .. either caused to be laid,
connived at or had knowledge of the laying of mines in certain areas of its
territorial waters in the Strait of Corfu”, but it named no other alleged
joint tortfeasor. In the course of the proceedings, British counsel intro-
duced evidence purporting to show that the mines actually had been
laid by ships of the Yugoslav Navy, with the knowledge of the Albanian
Government. But the Applicant’s submissions made no reference to
Yugoslavia and the Court in any event found that the alleged involvement
of Yugoslavia was not proved. For its part, Albania, which accepted the
Court’s jurisdiction by its acceptance of a recommendation of the Secu-
rity Council for the submission of the dispute to the Court, raised a preli-
minary objection to the admissibility of the case, but it was not founded on
the absence of an alleged joint tortfeasor. Accordingly, the most that may
be gleaned from this case is that, where it appears from the facts alleged or
shown that there was some unknown joint tortfeasor, the Court will not
dismiss the claim against the named tortfeasor proprio motu. There would
have been no good ground for its so doing, since a holding against Albania
could not have entailed the effective liability of an unnamed and
unknown joint tortfeasor for the very reason that it was unnamed and
unknown.

The case of Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 is the principal
precedent, although its singular circumstances — which were linked with
the failure of Albania to pay compensation to the United Kingdom as
ordered by the Court in the Corfu Channel case — ensure that it will not be
on all fours with the current or another case. For present purposes, it is
important that the Court and counsel for Nauru and Australia are agreed
that the Monetary Gold case is authority for a proposition of continuing
vitality, namely, that where a third State’s legal interests would not only be
affected by a decision but form the very subject-matter of the decision,



proceedings may not be maintained in the absence of that third State; and
that they are further agreed that, unlike the Monetary Gold case, in which
the question at issue in the Court could not be determined without first
passing upon the actions of Albania, a State not party to those proceed-
ings, “the determination of the responsibility of New Zealand or the
United Kingdom is not a prerequisite for the determination of the respon-
sibility of Australia...” (Judgment, para. 55).

But that is as far as their agreement goes. Australia maintains that, as the
Court puts it:

“in this case there would not be a determination of the possible
responsibility of New Zealand and the United Kingdom previous to
the determination of Australia’s responsibility. It nonetheless asserts
that there would be a simultaneous determination of the responsibi-
lity of all three States and argues that, so far as concerns New Zea-
land and the United Kingdom, such a determination would be
equally precluded by the fundamental reasons underlying the Mon-
etary Gold decision.” (Ibid.)

The Court however concludes, after observing that “the decision
requested of the Court regarding the allocation of the gold, was not purely
temporal but also logical”, that:

“Inthe present case, a finding by the Court regarding the existence
or the content of the responsibility attributed to Australia by Nauru
might well have implications for the legal situation of the two other
States concerned, but no finding in respect of that legal situation will
be needed as a basis for the Court’s decision on Nauru’s claims
against Australia. Accordingly, the Court cannot decline to exercise
its jurisdiction.” (Ibid.)

For my part, I find the Court’s reasoning unpersuasive, in the light of
the considerations set out below. The essence of my view is that, if a judg-
ment of the Court against a present State will effectively determine the
legal obligations of one or more States which are not before the Court, the
Court should not proceed to consider rendering judgment against the
present State in absence of the others. The fact that the timing of the find-
ing of the responsibility of the absent party precedes such a finding in
respect of the present party, or that the finding of the responsibility of the
absent party is a logical prerequisite to the finding of the responsibility of
the present party, is not significant. What is dispositive is whether the
determination of the legal rights of the present party effectively deter-
mines the legal rights of the absent party.

Before setting out why, on the facts of the instant case, [ am not in agree-
ment with the Court’s reasoning or conclusion, I shall discuss the two
other cases on which the Court relies.

MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES IN AND AGAINST NICARAGUA

The Court quotes in support of its construction of the meaning of the
Monetary Gold case a passage of the Court’s Judgment on jurisdiction and
admissibility in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicara-
gua:

“There is no doubt that in appropriate circumstances the Court
will decline, as it did in the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed
from Rome in 1943, to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it
where the legal interests of a State not party to the proceedings
‘would not only be affected by a decision, but would form the very
subject-matter of the decision’... Where however claims of a legal
nature are made by an Applicant against a Respondent in proceed-
ings before the Court, and made the subject of submissions, the
Court has in principle merely to decide upon those submissions, with
binding force for the parties only, and no other State, in accordance
with Article 59 of the Statute. As the Court has already indicated...
other States which consider that they may be affected are free to insti-
tute separate proceedings, or to employ the procedure of interven-
tion. There is no trace, either in the Statute or in the practice of
international tribunals, of an ‘indispensable parties’ rule of the kind
argued for by the United States, which would only be conceivable in
parallel to a power, which the Court does not possess, to direct that a
third State be made a party to proceedings. The circumstances of the
Monetary Gold case probably represent the limit of the power of the
Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction; and none of the States
referred to can be regarded as in the same position as Albania in that
case, so as to be truly indispensable to the pursuance of the proceed-
ings. (Judgment of 26 November 1984, 1.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 431,
para. 88.)” (Judgment, para. 51.)

This 1984 Judgment of the Court in the foregoing as well as some other
respects in my view was in error; far from reinforcing the jurisprudence of
the Monetary Gold case, it obfuscated it. It is necessary to recall what was
at issue in 1984 to explain why.

In its Application and argument, Nicaragua’s essential claim was that
military and paramilitary activities of the United States in and against
Nicaragua violated obligations of the United States under conventional
and customary international law. Nicaragua brought suit against the
United States alone. However, its Application and argument maintained
that El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica all were vitally involved in the
delicts of the United States, because they were lending their territory or
armed forces to the indicted activities of the United States. For its part, the
United States no less stressed the involvement of El Salvador, Honduras
and Costa Rica; indeed, its substantive defence to Nicaragua’s charges



was that its activities were conducted in the collective self-defence of those
nations which were the object of Nicaraguan subversive intervention
which was tantamount to armed attack, through Nicaragua’s provision of
arms, training, transit, sanctuary, and command-and-control facilities
particularly to insurrection in El Salvador. The Court in 1986 held against
the United States on the facts and on the law. It essentially concluded, on
the facts, that no responsibility could be attributed to the Government of
Nicaragua for any flow of arms across its territory to insurgents in El Sal-
vador; on the law, it held that in any event provision of arms to insurgents
could not be tantamount to an armed attack.

Now when the Court’s Judgment on jurisdiction and admissibility of
1984 is read together with that on the merits of 1986, it appears that the
articulate factual holdings of 1986 were the inarticulate factual premises
of 1984. That is to say, since the Court was not disposed in 1984 at the stage
of jurisdiction and admissibility provisionally to credit the charges of the
United States on the facts, it then could arrive at a holding on the law that,
if it were subsequently to decide in favour of Nicaragua’s submissions on
the merits, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica would be protected
against any adverse effects of such a judgment by reason of the import of
Articles 59, and 62 and 63, of the Statute. By reason of Article 59, the Judg-

vention in the case.

But, on the factual premises put forth by the United States, it is clear and
should have been clear in 1984 that Article 59 could provide no meaning-
ful protection to States such as El Salvador which were the objects of
alleged Nicaraguan support of armed insurrection within their borders.
Assuming the factual allegations of the United States (and of El Salvador)
about the activities ofthe Nicaraguan Government to have been true, but
contemplating nonetheless that the United States could be prohibited
from taking measures against Nicaragua to assist El Salvador in its
defence against those activities, of what use would it be to El Salvador to
rely upon the Court’s legal conclusion that the Court’s Judgment against
the United States was not binding upon it? If the United States were to
comply with the Judgment of the Court, it would cease to actin what it and
El Salvador maintained was the collective self-defence of El Salvador,
with the result that the latter’s Government, far from having its interests
conserved by the force of Article 59, could fall before the onslaught of the
insurrection so significantly supported by Nicaragua.



And what, in truth, did the facts turn out to be? As for Nicaragua’s
sworn and reiterated denials of any involvement in the material support of
insurrection in El Salvador, it subsequently was authoritatively reported
that an aircraft flying from Nicaragua packed with missiles was downed in
El Salvador, an event which was the subject of consideration in the Secu-
rity Council; and it later transpired that the Government of the Soviet
Union identified, by serial number, the launch tube of a ground-to-air
missile which it had supplied in 1986 to the Nicaraguan Government and
which had been fired by Salvadoran insurgents in El Salvador. Indeed, in
1991 it was acknowledged by the leadership of Nicaragua that a number
of Soviet-supplied missiles had been transferred to Salvadoran guerrillas
by elements of the Nicaraguan Army, at least two of which were used to
shoot down aircraft of the Salvadoran Government. So much for the
utility of Article 59 in safeguarding the position of El Salvador. As for
the possibility of its intervening in the proceedings between Nicaragua
and the United States, or instituting separate proceedings, that was a route
which offered no more comfort to El Salvador and similarly situated
States, having regard to the facts that they had made clear that they did not
wish to litigate their security before the Court and that the Court earlier in
1984 had itself summarily dismissed El Salvador’s request to intervene at
the stage of jurisdiction and admissibility in exercise of its statutory “right
to intervene in the proceedings” under Article 63, and had done so for
reasons which were in conformity neither with the Statute nor with the
Rules of Court.

Such precedential status as the Court’s holding in the case may be
thought to have is further prejudiced by the fact that in 1984 Nicaragua
maintained, in respect of the argument of the United States about the
effect to be attributed to the absence of El Salvador, Honduras and
Costa Rica, that — despite the terms of its Application and argument — it
made “no claim of illegal conduct by any State other than the United
States” and that it sought “no relief . . . from any other State”. These affir-
mations were belied as well, and within days of the 1986 Judgment on the
merits against the United States, when Nicaragua brought intimately
related claims in Court against Honduras and Costa Rica, as to which (in
apparent contrast to El Salvador) it could make out a title of jurisdiction.

In the light of these considerations, my position on the Court’s reliance
on the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
comes to this. The security interests of the States in whose interest the
United States claimed to be acting in collective self-defence were as close
if not closer to “the very subject-matter of the case” as were the interests of
Albania in the Monetary Gold case (see in this regard the analysis of Pro-
fessor Lori Fisler Damrosch, “Multilateral Disputes”, in Damrosch, ed.,
The International Court of Justice at a Crossroads, 1987, pp. 376, 390). In
their nature, those vital security interests presumably were more import-
ant to them than was Albania’s financial interest to it; more to the point,



by determining that the United States was not entitled to act with them in
their collective self-defence, the legal as well as the practical interests of
those States were no less decisively and centrally determined by the
Court’s Judgment than would the interests of Albania have been deter-
mined by the Court’s ruling in respect of it. This conclusion is reinforced
by specific prescriptions of the Court’s Judgment on the merits, which
went so far as to pass upon not only the circumstances in which the absent
State of El Salvador might take measures in self-defence but upon the pro-
portionate counter-measures which the three absent States, El Salvador,
Honduras and Costa Rica, could be permitted to take. Judgment in the
“Nicaragua” case, as in the case now before the Court, was to be “simul-
taneous” in its effect, but that is not the dispositive distinction. The Court
there rather should have given, and in the instant case should give, weight
to the intensity and not to the timing or logical derivation of the effects in
question. If the legal interests of a third State will not merely be affected
but effectively determined by the Court’s Judgment, the Court should not
proceed to give judgment in the absence of that third State.

Such cases may by their nature be rare and fortunately so, for the prin-
ciple of permitting third States by their non-appearance to foreclose liti-
gation between two States over which the Court otherwise has jurisdic-
tion is unappealing. The question is one of balancing the propriety of the
Court’s exercising to the full the jurisdiction which it has been given
against the impropriety of determining the legal interests of a third State
not party to the proceedings. While it may in practice be unusual for the
legal interests of a third State to be subject to such determination, where
they are, the balance should swing in its favour, and in favour of the
inadmissibility of the action against the present party.

LAND, ISLAND AND MARITIME FRONTIER DISPUTE

The final precedent applied by the Court is the Judgment in the case
concerning the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/
Honduras). It dealt with Nicaragua's Application to intervene in the case
pursuant to Article 62 of the Court’s Statute. Nicaragua sought to inter-
vene in various but not all aspects of a case involving several distinct
though in some respects interrelated matters. It not only maintained, pur-
suant to Article 62, that it had interests of a legal nature that may be
affected by the decision in the case; in one respect, Nicaragua argued that
its interests were so much part of the subject-matter of the case that the
Chamber of the Court could not properly exercise its jurisdiction without
its participation. Nicaragua contended that, where the vital issue to
be settled concerned the rights of Nicaragua in the Gulf of Fonseca



and the waters outside it, the Court could not, without its consent, give a
decision.

The Chamber observed that Nicaragua apparently thus suggested that
in such circumstances the failure of a State to intervene, or even refusal of
a request for permission to intervene, may deprive the Court of the right
with propriety to exercise jurisdiction conferred upon it by special
agreement between two other States. In rejecting this argument, the
Chamber referred with approval to its holdings respecting the effect of
Articles 62 and 59 of the Statute set out in the Monetary Gold case and in
Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua. And it
quoted the passage from the Monetary Gold case quoted above about
Albania’s legal interests forming “the very subject-matter of the decision”.
It continued that, if in the Frontier Dispute case the legal interests of Nicar-
agua did form part of the very subject-matter of the decision, this would
doubtless justify an intervention by Nicaragua under Article 62, which
lays down a less stringent criterion. The Chamber found that, in respect of
the Gulf waters, Nicaragua had shown the existence of an interest of a
legal nature which may be affected by the decision. But it held that that
interest did not form “the very subject-matter of the decision” as did the
interests of Albania in the Monetary Gold case. The Chamber explained
why in the following terms:

“while the Chamber is thus satisfied that Nicaragua has a legal inter-
est which may be affected by the decision of the Chamber on the
question whether or not the waters of the Guif of Fonseca are subject
to a condominium or a ‘community of interests’ of the three riparian
States, it cannot accept the contention of Nicaragua that the legal
interest of Nicaragua ‘would form the very subject-matter of the deci-
sion’, in the sense in which that phrase was used in the case concern-
ing Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 to describe the
interests of Albania . . . So far as the condominium is concerned, the
essential question in issue between the Parties is not the intrinsic val-
idity of the 1917 Judgement of the Central American Court of Justice
as between the parties to the proceedings in that Court, but the
opposability to Honduras, which was not such a party, either of that
Judgement itself or of the régime declared by the Judgement. Hondu-
ras, while rejecting the opposability to itself of the 1917 Judgement,
does not ask the Chamber to declare it invalid. If Nicaragua is per-
mitted to intervene, the Judgment to be given by the Chamber will not
declare, as between Nicaragua and the other two States, that Nicaragua
does or does not possess rights under a condominium in the waters of the
Gulf beyond its agreed delimitation with Honduras, but merely that, as
between El Salvador and Honduras, the régime of condominium
. declared by the Central American Court is or is not opposable to Hondu-
ras. It is true that a decision of the Chamber rejecting El Salvador’s
contentions, and finding that there is no condominium in the waters



of the Gulf which is opposable to Honduras, would be tantamount to
a finding that there is no condominium at all. Similarly, a finding that
there is no such ‘community of interests’ as is claimed by Honduras,
between El Salvador and Honduras in their capacity as riparian
States of the Gulf, would be tantamount to a finding that there is no
such ‘community of interests’ in the Gulf at all. In either event, such a
decision would therefore evidently affect an interest of a legal nature
of Nicaragua; but even so that interest would not be the ‘very subject-
matter of the decision’ in the way that the interests of Albania were in
the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943. . .it
follows from this that the question whether the Chamber would have
power to take a decision on these questions, without the participation
of Nicaragua in the proceedings, does not arise; but that the condi-
tions for an intervention by Nicaragua in this aspect of the case are
nevertheless clearly fulfilled.” (I.C.J. Reports 1990, p. 122, para. 73;
emphasis added.)

Ann. 80, No. 29.)

In view of the essential fact that, from 1919 until Nauruan indepen-
dence in 1968, Australia always acted as a member of a joint Administer-
ing Authority composed of three States, and always acted on behalf of its
fellow members of that joint Administering Authority as well as its own
behalf, it follows that its acts engaged or may have engaged not only its
responsibility — if responsibility be engaged at all — but those of its
“Partner Governments”.

Consequently, a judgment by this Court upon the responsibility of Aus-
tralia would appear to be tantamount to a judgment upon the responsibi-
lity of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Of course the Court’s
judgment in the current case would in terms be directed only to the parties
to it and will have binding force only in respect of that particular case. But
let us suppose that Nauru could and would pursue a course of serial litiga-
tion like that which Nicaragua pursued first against the United States and,
having obtained judgment against it, against Costa Rica and Honduras.
Can it be seriously maintained that if, arguendo, the Court were to hold on
the merits against Australia, the other States with which it jointly com-
posed the Administering Authority would enjoy a consideration whose
very subject-matter would not have been passed upon by the Court in the
current case?

Nauru maintains that:

“No legal right or responsibility of either State would be deter-
mined by the Court in this case, both by virtue of Article 59 of the
Statute and because the focus of the claim is on the acts and omis-
sions of Australia and of Australian officials responsible for the
administration of Nauru.” (Written Statement of the Republic of
Nauru, p. 93, para. 262.)

The answer to that core contention is that the protection afforded the
absent States by Article 59 in the quite exceptional situation of this case
would be notional rather than real; and that while the focus of the claim is
on the acts and omissions of Australia and Australian officials respon-
sible for the administration of Nauru, those acts and omissions were
those of Australia acting as one of three States which jointly constituted
the Administering Authority, and they were those of Australia acting
on behalf of New Zealand and the United Kingdom.



The issue of the weight to be accorded to the situation of absent States
may be a finely balanced one. In this case, for the reasons set out, my own
view is that the balance inclines towards holding the Application against
Australia alone to be inadmissible.
