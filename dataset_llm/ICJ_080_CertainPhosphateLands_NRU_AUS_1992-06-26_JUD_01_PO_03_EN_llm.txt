1. The main purpose of this opinion is to set forth my reasons for cast-
ing a negative vote on operative parts | (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the Judgment.
The Application of Nauru was, to my mind, clearly inadmissible on those
counts alone. My subsidiary purpose, which can be disposed of at once, is
to state that my negative vote on operative part 1 (f) is motivated by my
belief that it is premature to close the door on the objection concerned,
which I find too closely connected with the merits for present decision;
this particular vote on my part does not therefore signify that I necessarily
accept this objection without further examination.

the Court has held that

“[ilt will suffice to note that in fact those authorities did not at any
time effect a clear and unequivocal waiver of their claims, whether
one takes into consideration the negotiations which led to the Agree-
ment of 14 November 1967, the Agreement itself, or the discussions at
the United Nations” (Judgment, para. 13);

has rejected it because

“the rights Nauru might have had in connection with rehabilitation
of the lands remained unaffected. Regard being had to the particular
circumstances of the case, Australia’s third objection must in conse-
quence be rejected.” (Judgment, para. 30.)

4. I am unable to concur in these views of the Court. My view is differ-
ent from that of the Judgment with regard to the significance of certain
developments during the Trusteeship period. I have in particular some
doubts whether there really existed, towards the end of that period, any
Nauruan claim for land rehabilitation, and I feel unable to entertain what
the Judgment refers to, without further elaboration, as the “particular cir-
cumstances” (Judgment, paras. 23 and 30) prevailing at the termination of
the Trusteeship. Hence I must proceed to a somewhat lengthy recital of
the facts relating to “the negotiations which led to the Agreement of
14 November 1967, the Agreement itself, or the discussions at the United
Nations” (Judgment, para. 13).

of primary concern for the Nauruan people. They indicated that they
were pursuing the rehabilitation proposals in the absence of any
acceptable proposal for resettlement. They said that they should
receive the full financial benefit from the phosphate industry so that
there would be funds available to rehabilitate the whole of the Island.
The Joint Delegation [the Administering Authority] explained that

posed phosphate arrangement would, it was envisaged, be adequate
to provide for the present and long-term security of the Nauruan
community including an adequate continuing income when the
phosphate has been exhausted and when the costs of any resettle-
ment or rehabilitation have been met. The Joint Delegation said they
would be prepared to consider that, within the framework of a long-
term agreement, arrangements be made for an agreed payment into
the long-term investment fund, from which the costs or part of the
costs of rehabilitation could be met.” (Ibid., p. 407.)

9. At the Canberra meetings in May-June 1965, as mentioned in para-

12. I'have thus followed the developments in which the demands of the
Nauruan people for the rehabilitation of worked-out lands were pre-
sented in the talks between the Administering Authority and their repre-
sentatives. It is extremely important to note that the Canberra Agreement
reached by both parties (on the one hand, Australia, New Zealand and the
United Kingdom; on the other, the Nauru Local Government Council) on
14 November 1967, just on the eve of the independence of Nauru, to
arrange for the future operation, after independence, of the phosphate
industry, did not make any mention of the issue of rehabilitation. Counsel
for Nauru explained at the hearings that rehabilitation was not mentioned
in the 1967 Agreement on the understanding that the issue would be dealt
with separately. In fact that issue was not dealt with separately, and no
suggestion seems to have been made by the Nauruan authorities to deal
with this issue independently of that Agreement.

“[General Assembly resolution 2347 (XXII) of 19 December 1967]
had ‘definitive legal effect’ . . . Consequently, the Trusteeship Agree-
ment was ‘terminated’ on that date and ‘is no longer in force’... In
the light of these considerations, it might be possible to question the



admissibility of an action brought against the Administering Author-
ity on the basis of the alleged failure by it to comply with its obliga-
tions with respect to the administration of the Territory. However,
the Court does not consider it necessary to enter into this debate
and will confine itself to examining the particular circumstances
in which the Trusteeship for Nauru was terminated.” (Judgment,
para. 23.)

could possibly have existed at that time with regard to the administration
of Nauru under the United Nations Trusteeship on the eve of Nauru’s
independence, as no sovereign State was in a position to put forward a
claim based on a purported breach of the obligations entered into by Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as the Administering
Authority, during the Trusteeship period. A question, however, might
have been raised if there was indeed any dispute outstanding between the
independent State of Nauru and Australia, New Zealand and the
United Kingdom at the time of Nauru’s accession to independence. How-
ever, no claim to the rehabilitation of worked-out phosphate lands
addressed to the Administering Authority of the Trusteeship by the
people of Nauru was taken over by the State of Nauru at the time of inde-
pendence in 1968. No United Nations document under which Nauru
gained independence showed any evidence of a transfer of the claim or
of the creation of a fresh claim for the independent State of Nauru.



IT. RE OPERATIVE PARTS 1 (d) AND (e):


“liln the present case, it was well known, at the time when Nauru
gained its independence, that the question of the rehabilitation of the
phosphate lands had not been settled” (Judgment, para. 33),

and further stated that

“[tlhe Court considers that, given the nature of relations between
Australia and Nauru, as well as the steps thus taken, Nauru’s Appli-
cation was not rendered inadmissible by passage of time . . . [I]t will
be for the Court, in due time, to ensure that Nauru’s delay in seising it
will in no way cause prejudice to Australia with regard to both the
establishment of the facts and the determination of the content of the
applicable law.” (Judgment, para. 36.)

With regard to “the preliminary objection based on Nauru’s alleged lack
of good faith” (operative part 1 (e)),

“[tThe Court considers that the Application by Nauru has been prop-
erly submitted in the framework of the remedies open to it. At the
present stage, the Court is not called upon to weigh the possible con-
sequences of the conduct of Nauru with respect to the merits of the
case. It need merely note that such conduct does not amount to an
abuse of process. Australia’s objection on this point must also be
rejected.” (Judgment, para. 38.)




Nauru (contained in the Memorial of Nauru, Vol. 4, as Annex 42), which
became effective on the date of the independence, provided:

“83. 1. Except as otherwise provided by law, the right to mine
phosphate is vested in the Republic of Nauru.

2. Nothing in this Constitution makes the Government of Nauru
responsible for the rehabilitation of land from which phosphate was
mined before the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and
sixty-seven.”

independence, a claim of Nauru (as an independent State) against Aus-
tralia, for the rehabilitation of the worked-out phosphate lands, then,
according to the record, it was asserted at the very earliest during the talks
which Nauru held with Australia in 1983. One cannot conceive that the
claim which Nauru presented in its Application of 1989 or, even earlier, in
its negotiations with Australia in 1983, could have been based on elements
other than those which Nauru might have wished to have taken over in
1968. The fact that Nauru kept silent for more than 15 years on the subject
of the alleged claim makes it inappropriate for the Court to entertain it
and, if only on grounds of judicial propriety, the Court should therefore
find that the Application is inadmissible.
