Reports 1986, pp. 586-587, para. 63, and p. 566, para. 23).
   24. On the basis of the principle of uti possidetis juris, the present
Chamber must thus seek to determine, in the case before it, the boundary
that was inherited from the French administration. The Parties agree that
the dates to be taken into account for this purpose are those of their
respective independence, namely 1 and 3 August 1960 ; the Chamber
would observe that there was no change in the frontier between these two
very close dates.

   25. The Parties have nonetheless sometimes expressed differing
opinions regarding certain aspects of the application of the uti possidetis
juris principle in the present case.
   Firstly, Niger maintains that this principle does not preclude the Cham-
ber from taking account, where appropriate, of the physical realities sub-
sequent to independence, in order to ensure that the Judgment will have
meaningful and practical significance between the Parties. Consequently,
in requesting the Chamber to indicate to which State each of the islands
in the River Niger belongs, by reference to the line of deepest soundings
at the date of independence, Niger asks it to consider for this purpose
only those islands that exist at the present time.
   Benin, for its part, argues that, if the uti possidetis juris principle is to
be applied strictly, it would be unacceptable to refer to the present situa-
tion in order to determine to which Party the islands belonged at the date
of independence.
   The Chamber observes that, in any event, the Parties agree that the
course of their common boundary should be determined, in accordance
with the uti possidetis juris principle, by reference to the physical situa-


                       FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                        109

tion to which French colonial law was applied, as that situation existed at
the dates of independence. However, the consequences of such a course
on the ground, particularly with regard to the question of to which Party
the islands in the River Niger belong, must be assessed in relation to
present-day physical realities and, in carrying out the task assigned to it
under Article 2 of the Special Agreement, the Chamber cannot disregard
the possible appearance or disappearance of certain islands in the stretch
concerned.
   26. Secondly, Benin and Niger have put forward differing views with
respect to the documents or maps on which the Chamber should base its
determination of their common boundary.
   In support of its delimitation claims, Niger relies on certain documents
and maps that are posterior to the dates of independence, not only to
demonstrate current physical realities but also to establish the situation
existing in the colonial era. According to Niger, that situation must be
determined on the basis of the studies conducted closest in time to the
Parties’ accession to independence, without being confined to those con-
ducted prior to the dates of independence.

   Benin considers, to the contrary, that the Chamber should base its
decision on research and documents prior to the critical date.
   The Chamber cannot exclude a priori the possibility that maps, research
or other documents subsequent to that date may be relevant in order to
establish, in application of the uti possidetis juris principle, the situation
that existed at the time. In any event, since the effect of the uti possidetis
principle is to freeze the territorial title (Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/
Republic of Mali), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 568, para. 29), the
examination of documents posterior to independence cannot lead to any
modification of the “photograph of the territory” at the critical date
unless, of course, such documents clearly express the Parties’ agreement
to such a change.
   27. Thirdly, the Parties have discussed the legal value, in the light of
the uti possidetis juris principle, of post-colonial effectivités.
   The Chamber notes that both Parties have on occasion sought to con-
firm the legal title which they claim by relying on acts whereby their
authorities allegedly exercised sovereignty over the disputed territories
after 1960 ; such effectivités have been invoked by Niger inter alia in
respect of activities relating to the River Niger and its islands, and by
Benin in respect of activities relating to the right bank of the River
Mekrou.
   Such an approach should not necessarily be excluded. As stated by the
Chamber formed in the case concerning the Land, Island and Maritime
Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras : Nicaragua intervening), it is
possible to

    “have regard . . . in certain instances, to documentary evidence of
    post-independence effectivités when . . . they afford indications in


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                        110

    respect of the . . . uti possidetis juris boundary, providing a relation-
    ship exists between the effectivités concerned and the determination
    of that boundary” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 399, para. 62).


                                     *
   28. The Parties both acknowledge that, in accordance with the prin-
ciple of uti possidetis juris, the course of the frontier and the attribution
of islands in the River Niger to either one of them must be determined in
the light of French colonial law, known as “droit d’outre-mer”. They
also agree on the identification of the relevant rules of that law, but do
not share the same interpretation thereof.
   Before turning to those rules, the Chamber would recall that, when ref-
erence is made to domestic law in such a context, that law is applicable
    “not in itself (as if there were a sort of continuum juris, a legal relay
    between such law and international law), but only as one factual ele-
    ment among others, or as evidence indicative of . . . the ‘colonial
    heritage’ ” (Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali), Judg-
    ment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 568, para. 30).

   29. As the Chamber in the case concerning the Frontier Dispute
(Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali) (I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 568-569,
para. 31) already observed, the territorial administration of the French
possessions in West Africa was centralized by a decree of the President of
the French Republic of 16 June 1895 and placed under the authority of a
Governor-General. The entity of the AOF thus created was divided into
colonies, headed by Lieutenant-Governors and themselves made up of
basic units called “cercles” which were administered by commandants de
cercle ; each cercle was in turn composed of subdivisions, each adminis-
tered by a chef de subdivision. The subdivisions consisted of cantons,
which grouped together a number of villages.
   30. The Parties acknowledge that the creation and abolition of colo-
nies fell within the jurisdiction of the authorities of metropolitan France :
the President of the French Republic, acting by decree, under the Con-
stitution of the Third Republic, and subsequently the French Parliament,
following the adoption of the Constitution of 27 October 1946.
   The power to create territorial subdivisions within a single colony, on
the other hand, was vested in the AOF until being transferred to the local
representative institutions in 1957.
   Article 5 of the decree of the President of the French Republic, dated
18 October 1904, providing for the reorganization of the AOF, vested the
Governor-General with authority to “determine in government council
(conseil de gouvernement), and on the proposal of the Lieutenant-Gov-
ernors concerned, the administrative districts in each of the colonies”.
   In his circular No. 114c of 3 November 1912, concerning the form of


                       FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                           111

instruments for the organization of administrative districts and subdivi-
sions, the Governor-General interpreted this text as conferring upon him
“the right to establish . . . the number and extent of the cercles which,
within the colonies, constitute[d] the actual administrative unit”, but
pointed out that it was “acknowledged that the Lieutenant-Governors
would retain the power to determine the territorial subdivisions created
within these cercles by measures adopted under their own authority”.
According to that circular, “any measure concerning the administrative
district, the territorial unit proper, i.e. affecting the cercle, in terms of its
existence (creation or abolition), its extent, its name, or the location of its
administrative centre”, was to be confirmed by an arrêté général adopted
in government council ; it lay with the Lieutenant-Governors “to define,
by means of arrêtés, the approval of which [was] reserved to [the Gover-
nor-General], the exact and detailed topographical boundaries of each of
these districts”, as well as “within the cercles, [to] fix . . . the number and
extent of the territorial subdivisions . . . and the location of their centre”
by means of local decisions.

   31. Benin submits that, in the light of these texts, the rules applicable
to the creation of colonies and their subdivisions should be distinguished
from those relating to the establishment of territorial boundaries. At the
hearings, Benin nevertheless acknowledged that the principle whereby
authorities empowered to create colonies or administrative districts were
also competent to define or modify the boundaries thereof was certainly
applicable to colonies. However, Benin contended that such competence
was not exclusive and that in all likelihood the said principle did not
apply in respect of the internal boundaries within colonies. In any event,
the local authorities, headed by the Lieutenant-Governors, had author-
ity, by virtue of the rules governing the fixing of territorial boundaries, to
clarify central authorities’ decisions.
   Niger, on the other hand, contends that the power to create colonies,
as conferred by the above-mentioned texts, entailed the implicit power to
establish their overall extent, from which boundaries of varying precision
could be determined on a case-by-case basis. According to Niger, it fol-
lowed from this that the rules concerning the creation and organization
of colonial administrative districts gave implicit prerogatives to the French
metropolitan authorities for the determination of inter-territorial bounda-
ries, and to the authorities of the AOF for the delimitation of adminis-
trative districts and their subdivisions. The Lieutenant-Governors’ com-
petence in this matter was confined to certain specific circumstances,
according to a procedure and formalities laid down by the above-
mentioned texts.

  32. For a better understanding of the historical context in which the
Parties’ claims stand in relation to the determination of the frontier and


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                        112

to the question of to whom the islands in the River Niger belong, the
evolution of the legal status of the territories concerned during the colo-
nial period should be briefly recapitulated.
   33. In the second half of the nineteenth century, France initially estab-
lished settlements along the coast of Dahomey, at Cotonou and Porto
Novo. Following an armed conflict with the local chieftain in the 1880s
and 1890s, it consolidated its presence in the region first by placing
Dahomey under protectorate (1892), and then by creating the “colony of
Dahomey and dependencies” (decree of 22 June 1894). France subse-
quently launched expeditions northwards from its possessions in Daho-
mey, as well as southwards and eastwards from Sudan, which enabled it,
in the autumn of 1897, to occupy the valley of the River Niger (in par-
ticular the sector between Say and Boussa).
   The French occupation was expressly formalized, as regards the region
of north-western Dahomey, by a convention concluded with Germany on
23 July 1897, and as regards north-eastern Dahomey, by a convention
concluded with Great Britain on 14 June 1898. By means of a convention
of 8 April 1904, certain adjustments were made to the line established in
1898 in order to separate the French and British areas of influence. The
parties to that convention fixed the boundaries of their respective posses-
sions in accordance with those adjustments by means of a convention of
29 May 1906 in respect of the region to the east of the River Niger, and
by means of an agreement of 19 October 1906 in respect of the territories
between the Gulf of Guinea and that river ; demarcation operations,
documented in an official record dated 19 February 1910, were subse-
quently carried out by the Anglo-French Commission for the delimita-
tion of the territories situated between the Niger and Lake Chad.
   34. At the end of the nineteenth century, when the colony of Dahomey
was incorporated into the AOF by decree of 17 October 1899, it encom-
passed, in the region concerned by the present dispute, territories situated
on both banks of the River Niger. By virtue of the same decree, which
had provided for the dissolution of French Sudan and the apportionment
of the territories it had comprised among different colonies and two spe-
cially created military territories, the territory of Say was also attributed
to Dahomey. This territorial incorporation was put into effect by an
arrêté of the Governor of Dahomey dated 20 March 1901.
   By arrêté of 23 July 1900, the Governor-General of the AOF decided
to establish a third military territory encompassing the regions on the left
bank of the River Niger from Say to Lake Chad. That 1900 arrêté was
followed by a decree of the President of the French Republic dated
20 December 1900 with the same object. The boundary between the
Third Military Territory and the First Military Territory created in 1899
was subsequently determined by an arrêté of the Governor-General of
the AOF, dated 20 March 1902.
   By a decree of 18 October 1904 on the reorganization of the General
Government of the AOF, the President of the French Republic inter alia
established the colony of Haut-Sénégal et Niger comprising “the former


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                       113

territories of Haut-Sénégal and Moyen-Niger and those which form[ed]
the Third Military Territory”. The newly created colony was composed
of “cercles under civil administration” as well as the “Military Territory
of Niger”, constituted by the former First and Third Military Territories.

   By decree of 2 March 1907, the cercles of Fada-N’Gourma and Say
were detached from Dahomey and incorporated into the colony of Haut-
Sénégal et Niger. The intercolonial boundary fixed by that decree was
revised on two occasions in its western part, first by a decree of 12 August
1909, and subsequently by a decree of 23 April 1913.
   35. On 7 September 1911, a further decree separated the Military Ter-
ritory of Niger from the colony of Haut-Sénégal et Niger (the cercle of
Say remaining as a district of that colony), in order to make it an admin-
istrative subdivision under the direct control of the office of the Govern-
ment-General of the AOF. On 1 January 1921, that military territory
became the Civil Territory of Niger, and was then made an autonomous
colony by decree of 13 October 1922.
   In the meantime, the decree of 1 March 1919 had provided for the
establishment of the colony of Haute-Volta, to which were attributed,
inter alia, the cercles of Say and Fada-N’Gourma, which had hitherto
formed part of Haut-Sénégal et Niger.
   By decree of 28 December 1926, certain cantons in the cercle of Dori
and the cercle of Say (with the exception of the canton of Gourmanché-
de-Botou) were detached from Haute-Volta and incorporated into Niger.
An arrêté général of 31 August 1927 and the erratum thereto of 5 Octo-
ber of the same year determined the boundary between the colonies of
Haute-Volta and Niger.
   The colony of Haute-Volta was abolished by decree of 5 September
1932, then reconstituted with the same territorial basis by Law No. 47-
1707 of 4 September 1947 ; in the intervening period, the cercles of Fada
and Dori (excluding the canton of Aribinda) were incorporated into
Niger.
   36. During the colonial period, the administrative organization of
Dahomey and Niger was the subject of several successive enactments.
   Following its establishment in 1894, the colony of Dahomey and
dependencies was organized by arrêté of the Governor ad interim, dated
11 August 1898 ; that arrêté established four cercles in the colony, includ-
ing that of Moyen-Niger, which comprised inter alia “the territories of
Zaberma or Dendi situated on either side of the Niger and their depen-
dencies” and that of Gourma, which comprised “the provinces of Fada
N’Gourma, Pama, Matiacouali, Kodjar, Botou and their dependencies”.
The territorial divisions of the colony were reorganized by arrêtés of the
Governor-General of the AOF, dated 8 December 1934 and 27 October
1938 ; those two arrêtés inter alia defined the boundaries of the cercles of
Kandi and of Natitingou, adjoining the colony of Niger.
   The internal reorganization of Niger was the subject of successive
arrêtés of the Governor-General of the AOF, dated 26 December 1904,


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                       114

31 December 1907, 14 December 1908, 22 June 1910, 23 November 1912
and 22 January 1927. On the eve of independence, as a result of an arrêté
général of 30 March 1956 adding seven new cercles to the colony, Niger
comprised 16 cercles.

                                   *   *
   37. The Chamber will now describe the main documents relevant to
the settlement of the frontier dispute. In this connection, a distinction
should be made between those documents that concern the determination
of the course of the boundary in the River Niger sector and the question
of to whom the islands in that river belong and those documents that
relate to the delimitation in the River Mekrou sector.
   38. As regards the sector of the River Niger and the islands therein,
the essential documents, in chronological order, are as follows :
— the arrêté général of 23 July 1900 creating a Third Military Territory,
  the administrative centre of which was established at Zinder. Article 1
  of this arrêté stated that this territory “encompass[ed] the areas on
  the left bank of the Niger between Say and Lake Chad that [had
  been] placed within the French sphere of influence by the Convention
  of 14 June 1898” ;
— the decree of 20 December 1900 creating a Third Military Territory
  between the Niger and Lake Chad ;
— letter No. 163 from the Minister for the Colonies, dated 7 September
  1901, addressed to the Governor-General of the AOF. In this letter,
  the Minister referred to a previous communication, by which the
  Governor-General had transmitted two reports to him from the Gov-
  ernor of Dahomey “regarding the question of the delimitation between
  Dahomey and the Third Military Territory, and indicating the course
  of the Niger as the best demarcation line, both from a geographical
  and political perspective”. In response to the Governor-General’s
  view that this proposal seemed “highly acceptable”, the Minister indi-
  cated in his letter that “on this point, he share[d] [the] view” of the
  Governor-General ;
— letter No. 54 of 3 July 1914, under cover of which administrateur
  adjoint Sadoux, commandant of the secteur of Gaya (Niger), sent to
  the commandant of the cercle of Moyen-Niger (Dahomey) “a table of
  the islands in the River Niger indicating the major branch of the river
  and the colony to which the islands therefore belong[ed]”, which he
  had prepared “for the sole purpose of clearly determining when graz-
  ing permits [should] be issued to the Peuhls from both banks and
  delimiting the territorial jurisdiction of the indigenous tribunals in the
  two colonies”. In his letter, the administrateur adjoint indicated that
  he “believe[d] . . . that it [was] the main channel that [should] serve as
  delimitation” between the territories concerned, “the commandant of
  the secteur of Guéné having cited to [him the previous year] a text on


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                       115

  this subject, which [was] in Kandi, but [which he] [did] not have in
  Gaya” ;
— arrêté général No. 2812/AP of 8 December 1934 and arrêté général
  No. 3578/AP of 27 October 1938, both reorganizing the territorial
  divisions of the colony of Dahomey. The latter, whose text is virtually
  identical to that of 1934 in the part relevant to the present case, indi-
  cated in Article 1 that the cercle of Kandi was bounded

     “[in] the east, by the frontier of Nigeria [the 1934 arrêté referred to
     ‘the frontier of Niger’] as far as the Niger ;
     [i]n the north-east, by the course of the Niger to its confluence with
     the Mekrou . . .”.
  Article 2 stated that the boundaries of the cercles were those drawn
  on a 1 : 500,000 map of Dahomey appended to the arrêté (Article 2 of
  the 1934 arrêté being identical in content). However, neither of the
  Parties has been able, for the purposes of the present case, to locate
  the maps on which those boundaries had been drawn ;
— letter No. 3722/APA of 27 August 1954, by which Secretary-General
  Raynier, Governor ad interim of Niger, informed the chef of the sub-
  division of Gaya (Niger), through the commandant of the cercle of
  Dosso (Niger), “that the boundary of the Territory of Niger [was]
  constituted by the line of highest water, on the left bank of the river,
  from the village of Bandofay to the frontier of Nigeria” and that
  “[c]onsequently, all the islands situated in this part of the river
  [formed] part of the Territory of Dahomey”. The Parties have drawn
  the attention of the Chamber to other letters relating to the inter-
  colonial boundary exchanged between the authorities of Niger,
  between the authorities of Dahomey and between the two colonies
  during 1954, as well as in subsequent years (in 1956 for example),
  which would allegedly make it possible to assess the legal value and
  the significance of the aforementioned letter.
   39. With respect to the River Mekrou sector, the essential documents
from the colonial period are, in chronological order, as follows :
— a decree of 2 March 1907, incorporating the cercles of Fada
  N’Gourma and Say into the colony of Haut-Sénégal et Niger.
  Article 1 of this decree provided as follows :
    “[t]he boundary between the colony of Haut-Sénégal et Niger and
    the colony of Dahomey is formed, from the boundary of Togo, by
    the present boundary of the cercle of Gourma until it reaches the
    Atakora mountain range, whose summit it follows until it meets
    the Paris meridian, from which point it runs in a straight line in a
    north-easterly direction, terminating at the confluence of the River
    Mekrou with the Niger” ;
— a decree of 12 August 1909, Article 1 of which provided that “[t]he
  boundary between the cercle of Gourma (Haut-Sénégal et Niger) and


                     FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                      116

   the cercle of Djougou (Dahomey)” was formed, inter alia, by
      “[t]he Altacora mountain range, whose summit it follows, or, more
      precisely, a line parallel to the Konkobiri-Tandangou-Sangou trail
      running along the foot of the mountain, at a distance of 8 km from
      the trail” ;
— a decree of 23 April 1913, Article 1 of which provided that “[t]he
  boundary between the cercles of Fada-N’Gourma (Haut-Sénégal et
  Niger) and Atacora (Dahomey)” was determined, inter alia, by
      “a line parallel, in the east, to the Compongou-Konkobiri-Batch-
      ango trail running along the foot of the Atacora mountain range at
      a distance of 8 km from the trail and continuing until it meets the
      upper course of the River Pendjari” ;
— a decree of 1 March 1919 dividing the colony of Haut-Sénégal et
  Niger and creating the colony of Haute-Volta ;
— an arrêté général of 16 April 1926 laying down certain conditions for
  the implementation of the decree of 10 March 1925 regulating hunt-
  ing and creating game parks in the AOF ;
— an arrêté général adopted by the Governor-General ad interim of the
  AOF on 31 August 1927, fixing the boundaries of the colonies of
  Haute-Volta and Niger. Although, as stated by its text, this arrêté
  related to the frontier between Haute-Volta and Niger, it provided, in
  Article 1, paragraph 2, that the boundaries between the cercle of Say
  and Haute-Volta were formed
      “[i]n the South-West, [by] a line starting approximately from the
      [River] Sirba at the level of the Say parallel and running as far as
      the Mekrou ;
      [i]n the South-East, by the Mekrou from that point as far as its
      confluence with the Niger”.
  This arrêté général was amended, on this point among others, by an
  erratum of 5 October 1927, published in the Journal officiel of the
  AOF of 15 October 1927, in which the final subparagraph of Article 1
  provided simply that the boundary of the colonies of Niger and
  Haute-Volta “follows . . . the course of the Tapoa upstream until it
  meets the former boundary of the cercles of Fada and Say, which it
  follows as far as its intersection with the course of the Mekrou” ;
— the aforementioned arrêtés généraux of 8 December 1934 and
  27 October 1938, which indicated, inter alia, that the north-western
  boundary of the cercle of Kandi was formed by “the boundary
  between Dahomey and the colony of Niger, from the River Niger to
  the confluence of the Pendjari with the Kompongou southern
  ‘marigot’ ” ;
— local arrêté No. 1464 APA of the Governor ad interim of Dahomey,
  dated 30 September 1937, laying down certain conditions for the
  implementation of the decree of 13 October 1936 regulating hunting


                      FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                       117

  in the principal African territories under the jurisdiction of the
  Ministry of the Colonies ;
— local arrêté No. 1302/AE/SZ of the Governor of Niger, dated
  13 November 1937, providing that part of the territory of the cercles
  of Niamey and Fada N’Gourma would be set aside for the “Niger W
  National Park” ;
— arrêté général No. 7640 SE/F of 3 December 1952, designating part
  of the cercle of Kandi (Dahomey) as the “Niger W Total Reserve”,
  the boundaries of which it fixed ;
— arrêté général No. 4676 SE/F of 25 June 1953, creating the “Niger W
  Total Game Reserve” in an area situated in the cercle of Niamey
  (Niger), the boundaries of which it fixed.
  The Parties also discussed, in connection with the frontier in the River
Mekrou sector, the significance of certain documents that are posterior to
the dates of independence, in particular :
— Note Verbale No. 03498, addressed on 29 August 1973 to the Minis-
  try of Foreign Affairs of Dahomey by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
  of Niger, concerning the meeting of a joint committee regarding a
  joint dam project on the River Mekrou ;
— the minutes of a meeting of experts of the Governments of Niger and
  Dahomey, held on 8 February 1974, “concerning the Mekrou and the
  dam project on that river” ;
— the Agreement of 14 January 1999 between Niger and Benin, relating
  to the development of a hydroelectric facility at Dyodyonga on the
  River Mekrou.

                                     *
   40. The Parties also produced a large quantity of cartographic and
photographic material in support of their respective arguments, varying
in date, origin, technical quality and level of accuracy.

  41. With regard to the identification of the main channel of the River
Niger and the attribution of the islands in that river between the Parties,
Niger has relied in particular on the following, among many other maps
and sketch-maps : maps of the course of the Niger prepared in 1896 fol-
lowing a mission led by Lieutenant Commander Hourst to study the
régime of the river and its navigability ; the general 1 :10,000 plan from
the study on the navigability of the stretch of the Niger between Niamey
and Gaya carried out by the mission led by A. Beneyton in 1929-1930 ;
the map annexed to the report on the survey of the river between Niamey
and Malanville carried out in 1949 on the instructions of the chef des
services of the Benin-Niger region ; sheet No. 4 of the study on the navi-

the River Niger between Tossaye and Yelwa conducted from 1967
onwards by NEDECO, a Dutch firm, at the request of four riparian
States (Dahomey, Mali, Niger and Nigeria), the work on the ground
being carried out in 1968-1969 and the final report produced in Septem-
ber 1970 ; and sheets Nos. 1 to 4 on a scale of 1 : 50,000 from the study of
the River Niger in 1979 by the French Institut géographique national
(IGN) on the basis of a photographic mission in April 1975. Niger also
pointed out that the 1 : 200,000 maps of West Africa published by the
AOF cartographic service in Dakar in 1955 and 1960 situated the inter-
colonial boundary in the course of the river.

   For its part, Benin has referred to cartographic material dating from
the colonial period, produced by one or other of the Parties, to demon-
strate that the cartographers never took it for granted that the boundary
between the colonies of Dahomey and Niger followed the navigable
channel of the River Niger. Moreover, according to Benin, the above-
mentioned sketch-maps or studies, relied on by Niger in support of its
argument, cannot be used to define the navigable channel at the dates of
independence or to determine to which of the Parties the islands in the
river belong. Finally, Benin relies on a study carried out for the purposes
of the present case by IGN-France international in December 2003,
which compared the maps of the region published by IGN in 1960 with
SPOT images on the same scale recorded in 2002, in order to show the
changes in the configuration of the widest channel and islands of the
River Niger over the last 50 years.
   42. With regard to the River Mekrou sector, each Party has relied on
several maps dating from the colonial period to support its position.

   According to Benin, these maps (in particular those prepared after
1919, with the exception of a map dated 1922 and republished in 1928
cited by Niger) confirm that the Mekrou was the intercolonial boundary.
Benin refers, inter alia, to the following cartographic documentation : the
“Kandi” and “Niamey” sheets of the map (1 : 500,000) prepared and pub-
lished in October 1926 by the AOF Geographical Service (known as the
“Blondel la Rougery map”) ; the map entitled “New Boundary of Haute-
Volta and Niger (according to the erratum of 5 October 1927 to the
arrêté of 31 August 1927)” (1 : 1,000,000) ; an undated map entitled
“Sketch-map of the Colony of Niger prepared by Colonel Abadie of
the Colonial Infantry” (1 : 4,500,000) ; a Dahomey-Togo road map
(1 : 1,000,000) prepared by the AOF Geographical Service in 1938 ; and a
road sketch-map entitled “Dahomey and Togo” prepared by the same
service in 1948.
   Niger has relied on a large amount of cartographic material to show
that the colonial authorities had only a vague knowledge of the River
Mekrou region and of the exact course of that river, and that the bound-
ary established by the decree of 2 March 1907 had never been challenged ;
in this connection, it drew the attention of the Chamber to a combined


                     FRONTIER DISPUTE (JUDGMENT)                       119

political and administrative map of the AOF published in 1928 (the
updated version of a similar map prepared in 1922) on which the dates of
2 March 1907 and 6 September 1909 are placed along the line marking
the boundary in the Mekrou sector.
  43. Finally, the Parties refer to certain maps in order to determine the
indicative co-ordinates of precise points on their common frontier.
  Thus Benin measures the co-ordinates of the tripoints with Burkina
Faso and Nigeria on the basis of the relevant sheets of what it regards as
the most reliable map published on the eve of the independence of the
two States, namely a 1 : 200,000 map of the AOF produced by the IGN in
1955.
  Niger has noted that the co-ordinates of the Benin/Niger bipoint and
of the tripoint with Burkina Faso that it claims in the River Mekrou sec-
tor were plotted on 1 : 200,000 IGN maps (the Kandi sheet of a map of
West Africa published by the IGN which is annexed to its Memorial).
