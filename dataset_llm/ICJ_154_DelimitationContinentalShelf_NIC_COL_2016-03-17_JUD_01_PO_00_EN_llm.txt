                       Analysis of the Court — Critical date for establishing jurisdiction — Effects of
                   denunciation determined by first paragraph of Article LVI — Question whether
                   second paragraph of Article LVI alters effect of first paragraph — Second para-
                   graph confirms that procedures instituted before notification of denunciation can
                   continue irrespective of that denunciation — Proceedings instituted during one‑year
                   notice period are proceedings instituted while Pact still in force — Colombia’s
                   interpretation would result in most of the Articles of the Pact losing effect while
                   Pact still in force — Colombia’s interpretation not consistent with object and
                   ­purpose of Pact — Colombia’s interpretation not necessary to give effet utile to
                    second paragraph of Article LVI — Colombia’s first preliminary objection
                    rejected.


                      Analysis by the Court — Principle of res judicata — Finality of decision
                   adopted in a particular case — Identity between parties, object and legal ground —
                   Identity between successive claims not sufficient — Need to determine to what
                   extent first claim already definitively settled — Ascertainment of what is covered
                   by res judicata — Meaning of operative clause may need to be established by ref-
                   erence to reasoning of Judgment.

                      Content and scope of subparagraph 3 of operative clause of 2012 Judgment —
                   Meaning to be attributed to words “cannot uphold” — Examination of reasoning
                   in Section IV of 2012 Judgment — The fact that Colombia not a party to
                   UNCLOS did not relieve Nicaragua of its obligations under Article 76 of
                   UNCLOS — At time of 2012 Judgment, Nicaragua had only submitted “Prelimi-
                   nary Information” to CLCS — Finding of the Court in paragraph 129 of
                   2012 Judgment — The Court did not take a decision on whether or not Nicaragua
                   had an entitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its
                   coast — Nicaragua’s claim in final submission I (3) of 2012 not upheld because it
                   had yet to discharge its obligation under paragraph 8 of Article 76 of UNCLOS —
                   Any delimitation conditional on fulfilment of this obligation.


                      Application of res judicata principle in the case — Nicaragua submitted “final”
                   information to CLCS in 2013 — Fulfilment of condition imposed in 2012 Judg-
                   ment — The Court not precluded by res judicata from ruling on Nicaragua’s
                   Application — Colombia’s third preliminary objection rejected.

                       Colombia’s fourth preliminary objection according to which the Court lacks
                    jurisdiction over a claim that is an attempt to appeal and revise 2012 Judgment —
                    Nicaragua does not request the Court to revise 2012 Judgment, nor does it frame
                    Application as an “appeal” — Colombia’s fourth preliminary objection not founded
                    and therefore rejected.

                        Colombia’s fifth preliminary objection.
                        Question of inadmissibility of Nicaragua’s First Request — Whether recom-
                    mendation by CLCS is a prerequisite for the Court to delimit continental shelf
                    beyond 200 nautical miles — Role and function of CLCS — Delimitation of
                    ­continental shelf distinct from delineation of its outer limits — Delimitation of
                     continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles can be undertaken independently of a
                     recommendation from CLCS — Recommendation not a prerequisite — Prelimi-
                     nary objection to admissibility of Nicaragua’s First Request rejected.

                       Question of inadmissibility of Nicaragua’s Second Request — Second Request
                    does not relate to an actual dispute between the Parties — Preliminary objection
                    to admissibility of Nicaragua’s Second Request upheld.

                                                     JUDGMENT
