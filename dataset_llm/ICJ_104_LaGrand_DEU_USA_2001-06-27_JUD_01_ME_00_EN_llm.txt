10. In its Application, Germany formulated the decision requested in the fol-
lowing terms:

“Accordingly the Federal Republic of Germany asks the Court to

at which the competent authorities in the United States became aware of
the fact that the LaGrands were German nationals. Germany argues that
the authorities of Arizona were aware of this from the very beginning,
and in particular that probation officers knew by April 1982. The United
States argues that at the time of their arrest, neither of the LaGrands
identified himself to the arresting authorities as a German national, and
that Walter LaGrand affirmatively stated that he was a United States
citizen. The United States position is that its “competent authorities” for
the purposes of Article 36, paragraph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention
were the arresting and detaining authorities, and that these became aware
of the German nationality of the LaGrands by late 1984, and possibly by
mid-1983 or earlier, but in any event not at the time of their arrest in
1982. Although other authorities, such as immigration authorities or pro-
bation officers, may have known this even earlier, the United States
argues that these were not “competent authorities” for the purposes
of this provision of the Vienna Convention. The United States has also
suggested that at the time of their arrest, the LaGrands may themselves
have been unaware that they were not nationals of the United States.

the course of these proceedings the United States Court of Appeals,
Ninth Circuit, again held the issue of failure of consular notification to be
procedurally defaulted. Karl LaGrand was executed later that same day.

30. On 2 March 1999, the day before the scheduled date of execution
of Walter LaGrand, at 7.30 p.m. (The Hague time), Germany filed in the
Registry of this Court the Application instituting the present proceedings
against the United States (see paragraph 1 above), accompanied by a
request for the following provisional measures:


x * +

35. The Court must as a preliminary matter deal with certain issues,
which were raised by the Parties in these proceedings, concerning the

ing State if, within its consular district, a national of that State
is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial
or is detained in any other manner. Any communication
addressed to the consular post by the person arrested, in prison,
custody or detention shall be forwarded by the said authorities
without delay. The said authorities shall inform the person con-
cerned without delay of his rights under this subparagraph;

(c) consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the
sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to con-
verse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal rep-
resentation. They shall also have the right to visit any national
of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention in
their district in pursuance of a judgement. Nevertheless, consu-
lar officers shall refrain from taking action on behalf of a
national who is in prison, custody or detention if he expressly
opposes such action.”


44. Germany asserts that the Court's Order of 3 March 1999 was
intended to “enforce” the rights enjoyed by Germany under the Vienna
Convention and “preserve those rights pending its decision on the
merits”. Germany claims that a dispute as to “whether the United States
were obliged to comply and did comply with the Order” necessarily arises
out of the interpretation or application of the Convention and thus falls

for claims as closely interrelated with each other as the ones before the
Court in the present case”.

45. The third submission of Germany concerns issues that arise directly
out of the dispute between the Parties before the Court over which the
Court has already held that it has jurisdiction (see paragraph 42 above),
and which are thus covered by Article I of the Optional Protocol. The

based on facts subsequent to the filing of the Application, but arising
directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of that Applica-
tion. As such it falls within the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction . . .”
(Fisheries Jurisdiction ( Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits,
Judgment, 1.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 203, para. 72). Where the Court has
jurisdiction to decide a case, it also has jurisdiction to deal with submis-

intended to confer additional legal rights on the Applicant State . . .
The United States does not believe that it can be the role of the
Court . . . to impose any obligations that are additional to or that
differ in character from those to which the United States consented
when it ratified the Vienna Convention.”

47. Germany counters this argument by asserting that

“a dispute whether or not the violation of a provision of the Vienna
Convention gives rise to a certain remedy is a dispute concerning


“there exists a dispute as to whether the relief sought by Paraguay is
a remedy available under the Vienna Convention, in particular in
relation to Articles 5 and 36 thereof’; and . . . this is a dispute arising
out of the application of the Convention within the meaning of
Article I of the Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory
Settlement of Disputes of 24 April 1963” (LC.J. Reports 1998,
p. 256, para. 31).

edies for the violation of the Convention alleged by Germany is a dispute
that arises out of the interpretation or application of the Convention and
thus is within the Court’s jurisdiction. Where jurisdiction exists over a
dispute on a particular matter, no separate basis for jurisdiction is
required by the Court to consider the remedies a party has requested for
the breach of the obligation (Factory at Chorzôw, P.C.LJ., Series A,

“procedural default”, ask the Court “to address and correct . . . asserted
violations of US law and errors of judgment by US judges” in criminal
proceedings in national courts.

51. Germany denies that it requests the Court to act as an appellate
criminal court, or that Germany's requests are in any way aimed at inter-
fering with the administration of justice within the United States judicial
system. It maintains that it is merely asking the Court to adjudge and
declare that the conduct of the United States was inconsistent with its
international legal obligations towards Germany under the Vienna Con-
vention, and to draw from this failure certain legal consequences pro-

States concerning the admissibility of the second, third and fourth Ger-
man submissions. In the second submission, Germany asks the Court to
interpret the scope of Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Vienna Convention;
the third submission seeks a finding that the United States violated an
Order issued by this Court pursuant to Article 41 of its Statute: and in
Germany's fourth submission, the Court is asked to determine the appli-
cable remedies for the alleged violations of the Convention. Although
Germany deals extensively with the practice of American courts as it
bears on the application of the Convention, ali three submissions seek to
require the Court to do no more than apply the relevant rules of inter-

53. The United States also argues that Germany's third submission is
inadmissible because of the manner in which these proceedings were
brought before the Court by Germany. It notes that German consular
officials became aware of the LaGrands’ cases in 1992, but that the Ger-
man Government did not express concern or protest to the United States

nationals; according to the United States, their German nationality was
referred to in pre-sentence reports prepared in 1984, which should
have been familiar to German consular officers much earlier than 1999,
given Germany's claims regarding the vigour and effectiveness of
its consular assistance.

may render an application inadmissible, but maintains that international
law does not lay down any specific time-limit in that regard. It contends
that it was only seven days before it filed its Application that it became
aware of all the relevant facts underlying its claim, in particular, the fact
that the authorities of Arizona knew of the German nationality of the
LaGrands since 1982. According to Germany, it cannot be accused of
negligence in failing to obtain the 1984 pre-sentence reports earlier. It

57. The Court recognizes that Germany may be criticized for the man-
ner in which these proceedings were filed and for their timing. The Court
recalls, however, that notwithstanding its awareness of the consequences
of Germany’s filing at such a late date it nevertheless considered it appro-
priate to enter the Order of 3 March 1999, given that an irreparable

tions. Moreover, the State is not accountable for the errors or mistaken
strategy by lawyers.

59. Germany responds that international law requires the exhaustion
of only those remedies which are legally and practically available. Ger-
many claims that in this case there was no remedy which the LaGrands

of criminal justice requires the annulment of criminal convictions where
there has been a breach of the duty of consular notification; and that the
practice of Germany in similar cases has been to do no more than offer
an apology. The United States maintains that it would be contrary to
basic principles of administration of justice and equality of the Parties to
apply against the United States alleged rules that Germany appears not
to accept for itself.

62. Germany denies that it is asking the United States to adhere to
standards which Germany itself does not abide by; it maintains that its
law and practice is fully in compliance with the standards which it
invokes. In this regard, it explains that the German Code of Criminal



Procedure provides a ground of appeal where a legal norm, including a
norm of international law, is not applied or incorrectly applied and where
there is a possibility that the decision was impaired by this fact.

63. The Court need not decide whether this argument of the United
States, if true, would result in the inadmissibility of Germany's submis-
sions. Here the evidence adduced by the United States does not justify
the conclusion that Germany’s own practice fails to conform to the
standards it demands from the United States in this litigation. The
United States relies on certain German cases to demonstrate that Ger-
