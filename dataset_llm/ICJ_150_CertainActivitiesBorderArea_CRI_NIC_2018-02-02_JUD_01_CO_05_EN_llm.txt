                    5. Early in its Judgment, the Court recalled the relevant principles of
                 the law of international responsibility, noting that “the breach of an
                 engagement involves an obligation to make reparation” (ibid., para. 29).
                 According to the well‑known dictum of the Permanent Court in the Fac-
                 tory at Chorzów case, reparation is intended to “wipe out all the conse-
                 quences of the illegal act and re‑establish the situation which would, in all
                 probability, have existed if that act had not been committed” (Factory at
                 Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17,
                 p. 47). The International Law Commission stated in its Draft Articles on
                 State Responsibility that “[f]ull reparation for the injury caused by the
                 internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensa-
                 tion and satisfaction” (Art. 34). Whenever possible, however, restitution
                 in kind should be preferred (Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment





6 CIJ1133.indb 265                                                                               29/10/18 14:12

                                   certain activities (decl. guillaume)                      110

                 No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47). If this form of reparation
                 “is materially impossible or involves a burden out of all proportion to the
                 benefit deriving from it, reparation takes the form of compensation or
                 satisfaction” (Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay),
                 Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 103, para. 273; see also para-
                 graph 31 of the Judgment).
                    6. In this case, neither Party contemplated restitution, i.e. the rehabili-
                 tation of the sites by Nicaragua. The Court’s task is thus limited to fixing
                 the amount of compensation due to Costa Rica.
                    7. When ruling on a request for compensation,
                      “the Court [considers] whether an injury is established. It . . . then
                      ‘ascertain[s] whether, and to what extent, the injury asserted by the
                      Applicant is the consequence of wrongful conduct by the Respond-
                      ent’, taking into account ‘whether there is a sufficiently direct and
                      certain causal nexus between the wrongful act . . . and the injury suf-
                      fered by the Applicant’ (Application of the Convention on the Preven-
                      tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
                      Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      2007 (I), pp. 233‑234, para. 462). If the existence of injury and causa-
                      tion is established, the Court . . . then determine[s] the valuation.”
                      (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic
                      of the Congo), Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I),
                      p. 332, para. 14; see also paragraph 32 of the Judgment.)
                    8. The sole purpose of the compensation due is to make reparation for
                 the injury suffered. It does not depend on the seriousness of the acts alleged.
                 Consequently, and as recalled by the Court, “[c]ompensation should
                 not . . . have a punitive or exemplary character” (Judgment, para. 31).
                    9. “[A]s a general rule”, and in accordance with extensive jurisprudence,
                 “it is for the party which alleges a particular fact in support of its claims to
                 prove the existence of that fact”. However, the Court does not exclude the
                 possibility that, in certain cases, “this general rule . . . [has to] be applied
                 flexibly”, in particular when the respondent “may be in a better position to
                 establish certain facts” (Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.
                 Democratic Republic of the Congo), Compensation, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                 2012 (I), p. 332, para. 15; see also paragraph 33 of the Judgment). This is
                 not the case here, however, since it is in fact Costa Rica alone which has
                 access to the disputed area, that area falling under its sovereignty. Thus,
                 when examining each of the heads of damage alleged by the Applicant, the
                 Court was right to seek to determine whether Costa Rica had established
                 the existence of the damage, the causal link between the damage and Nica-
                 ragua’s unlawful activities and the cost of that damage.
                    10. Having set out these principles, it is necessary to examine
                 Costa Rica’s submissions regarding the material damage sustained. I will
                 divide these submissions into three categories:
                 (a) expenses which have been or will be incurred with a view to reducing
                     environmental damage through appropriate work;





6 CIJ1133.indb 267                                                                                  29/10/18 14:12

                                   certain activities (decl. guillaume)                   111

                 (b) compensation due for damage which will remain in spite of such
                     work;
                 (c) certain ancillary expenses incurred between 2010 and 2015, inter alia,
                     to visit, overfly and acquire satellite images of the sites.

                   11. Let us first examine the expenses which may have been or may be
                 incurred by Costa Rica to rehabilitate the sites.
                   12. Here, Costa Rica seeks reimbursement of US$195,671.02 for
                 expenses incurred in constructing a dyke across the 2013 eastern caño to
                 prevent it from connecting the San Juan River to the sea. Nicaragua
                 assesses the reimbursable expenses under this head at US$153,517. The
                 Court awarded US$185,414.56 (Judgment, para. 146). Although I find
                 this assessment generous, I cannot object to it.

                    13. Second, Costa Rica seeks US$54,925.69 for replacing the soil
                 removed from the caños. The Court was right to reject this claim (ibid.,
                 para. 87). The caños have in fact largely refilled and revegetated naturally.
                 It is therefore hard to see why almost 10,000 cubic metres of earth should
                 now be emptied into them, at the risk of destroying the vegetation that
                 has already regrown there. Moreover, the Secretariat of the Ramsar Con-

                    14. This leaves Costa Rica’s claim for compensation in the amount of
                 US$2,708.39 for the “restoration of the wetland”. This would clearly be
                 welcome, and Costa Rica’s claim is thus justified in principle. I would
                 note, however, that the Applicant provides no details of the work it
                 intends to carry out to that end or of the timescale for that work. Although
                 I share the majority opinion of the Court on this point (ibid.) I would
                 like to express here my hope that this work will actually be planned and
                 carried out.

                    15. Compensation for the construction of the dyke and for the restora-
                 tion of the wetland could not make full reparation for the environmental
                 damage caused to Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica assesses the lasting
                 damage resulting from the excavation of the first caño in 2010 at
                 US$2,148,820.82, and the lasting damage resulting from the excavation of
                 the 2013 eastern caño, at US$674,290.92, namely US$2,823,111.74 in
                 total. It claims nothing in respect of the western caño excavated in 2013.
                    Using a different method of assessment, Nicaragua estimates this dam-
                 age at no more than US$34,987. Nicaragua’s experts add, however, that





6 CIJ1133.indb 269                                                                               29/10/18 14:12

                                   certain activities (decl. guillaume)                   112

                 if Costa Rica’s method of assessment were to be applied, and the errors
                 corrected, the amount of compensation due would increase to US$84,296.
                 
                    The Court awarded US$120,000 to Costa Rica under this head (Judg-
                 ment, para. 86).
                    16. Before I examine the Parties’ arguments in detail, it is important to
                 recall that the first caño excavated in 2010 was intended to connect the

                 of trees of various sizes across an area of some two and a half hectares in
                 total.
                    The eastern caño excavated in 2013 — far shorter than the first — was
                 intended to connect the San Juan River to the sea, but the excavation
                 work was stopped before the connection could be made; as we have seen,
                 a dyke was then built to avoid any risk of the river connecting with the
                 ocean.
                    Finally, the San Juan River is known to carry large amounts of sedi-
                 ment, which have led to a considerable extension of its delta. In the
                 absence of any clearing activities, that sediment has accumulated in the
                 caños, which have become obstructed by natural means. The satellite
                 images show that the two areas are now completely revegetated.
                    These circumstances should be borne in mind when examining the Par-
                 ties’ submissions.
                    17. Costa Rica contends that Nicaragua’s unlawful activities have
                 caused the following ecosystem goods and services to be lost:
                 (a) standing timber;
                 (b) other raw materials;
                 (c) gas regulation;
                 (d) natural hazards mitigation;
                 (e) soil formation and erosion control; and
                 (f) biodiversity, in terms of habitat and nursery.
                   18. Costa Rica evaluates the loss connected with these various goods
                 and services by referring to values obtained for other locations in the
                 existing documentation and applying these values to this case. It thus
                 adopts what is generally known as a “benefits transfer” approach. How-
                 ever, it uses a different method to assess the loss of standing timber, rely-
                 ing on the local market price.

                   19. Nicaragua does not deny that these various types of damage are
                 compensable, but states that some of them do not exist and that the
                 method adopted by Costa Rica to assess others is flawed. It adds that the
                 Applicant has made some serious errors in the application of its own
                 method of assessment.
                   For its part, Nicaragua proposes evaluating the damage sustained by
                 determining the overall “replacement costs”, i.e. the “price that would





6 CIJ1133.indb 271                                                                               29/10/18 14:12

                                   certain activities (decl. guillaume)                    113

                 have to be paid to preserve an equivalent area until the services provided
                 by the impacted area have recovered”.
                    20. International law does not impose the use of any particular method
                 for evaluating damage. It should be noted, however, that the
                 United Nations Compensation Commission, founded in the aftermath of
                 Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, adopted the approach favoured by Nicaragua.
                 It may also be noted that this same approach was adopted in United
                 States legislation, in the Oil Pollution Act, and in the European Union’s
                 Environmental Liability Directive. That said, it is for the Court to deter-
                 mine the amount of compensation due by conducting the most accurate
                 assessment possible, leaving aside quibbles over methodology.

                     every year for 49 years. The damage resulting from the timber’s dis-
                     appearance is not incurred on an annual basis.

                     Furthermore, Costa Rica does little to contest this in its Reply on the
                     question of compensation, and merely states that, in terms of national
                     accounting, the value of the felled trees will be lost from the nation’s
                     assets for 50 years (subject to its gradual recovery). The Court was
                     rightly unconvinced by this reasoning. After they have been felled,
                     the trees cease to be part of the nation’s assets. Once paid, the com-
                     pensation will in turn form part of the assets and the accounts will be
                     in order.
                 (c) In addition to these fundamental observations, I would point out that
                     certain other aspects of the Applicant’s calculations are open to
                     challenge.

                     be gradual. Costa Rica claims in its Reply on the question of com-
                     pensation that the 4 per cent discount rate takes this into considera-
                     tion. But that is not correct: the discount rate should aim to take
                     account of the fact that, instead of receiving compensation each year
                     throughout the entire recovery period, Costa Rica will receive a single
                     payment in 2018 corresponding to the current value of those annual
                     instalments.
                     After correcting some of these errors by Costa Rica, Nicaragua’s
                     experts, applying the Applicant’s own method, conclude that the
                     amount of compensation due here should be no more than US$30,175.
                     This figure is a little low, but it gives an approximate idea of the
                     damage sustained under this head.
                    24. Continuing my examination of the heads of damage claimed by
                 Costa Rica, I now turn to the other raw materials (fibre and energy) that
                 were lost. Costa Rica evaluates the damage resulting from the loss of

6 CIJ1133.indb 275                                                                               29/10/18 14:12

                    I have serious doubts about the evaluation of this damage. We have
                 seen no proof that the vegetation cut back to the ground by Nicaragua
                 was used locally for its fibres (to make baskets, for example) or as fuel, or
                 that it could be used to provide such services. Moreover, the alleged
                 damage is assessed using the benefits transfer approach, on the basis of
                 unclear criteria. The 50‑year period is particularly unjustified, since the
                 vegetation in question recovers over a far shorter period than is needed
                 for tree regrowth, as recognized by the Court (Judgment, paras. 76
