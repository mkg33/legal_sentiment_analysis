                              I. PROLEGOMENA

   1. I regret not to be able to accompany the Court’s majority in the
Judgment of today, 5 October 2016 in the present case of Obligations
concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race
and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. Pakistan), whereby it
has found that the existence of a dispute between the Parties has not been
established before it, and that the Court has no jurisdiction to consider
the Application lodged with it by the Marshall Islands, and cannot thus
proceed to the merits of the case. I entirely disagree with the present
Judgment. As my dissenting position covers all points addressed in it, in
its reasoning as well as in its resolutory points, I feel obliged, in the faith-
ful exercise of the international judicial function, to lay on the records the
foundations of my own position thereon.


   2. In doing so, I distance myself as much as I can from the position of
the Court’s majority, so as to remain in peace with my conscience. I shall
endeavour to make clear the reasons of my personal position on the mat-
ter addressed in the present Judgment, in the course of the present dis-
senting opinion. I shall begin by examining the question of the existence
of a dispute before the Hague Court (its objective determination by the
Court and the threshold for the determination of the existence of a dis-
pute). I shall then turn attention to the distinct series of UN Gen-
eral Assembly resolutions on nuclear weapons and opinio juris. After
surveying also UN Security Council resolutions and opinio juris, I shall
dwell upon the saga of the United Nations in the condemnation of nuclear
weapons. Next, I shall address the positions of the Contending Parties on
UN resolutions and the emergence of opinio juris.
   3. In logical sequence, I shall then, looking well back in time, underline
the need to go beyond the strict inter-State dimension, bearing in mind
the attention of the UN Charter to peoples. Then, after recalling the fun-
damental principle of the juridical equality of States, I shall dwell upon
the unfoundedness of the strategy of “deterrence”. My next line of con-
siderations pertains to the illegality of nuclear weapons and the obliga-
tion of nuclear disarmament, encompassing: (a) the condemnation of all
weapons of mass destruction; (b) the prohibition of nuclear weapons (the
need of a people-centred approach, and the fundamental right to life); (c)


618      nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. cançado trindade)

the absolute prohibitions of jus cogens and the humanization of interna-
tional law; (d) pitfalls of legal positivism.


   4. This will bring me to address the recourse to the “Martens clause”
as an expression of the raison d’humanité. My following reﬂections, on
nuclear disarmament, will be in the line of jusnaturalism, the humanist
conception and the universality of international law; in addressing the
universalist approach, I shall draw attention to the principle of humanity
and the jus necessarium transcending the limitations of jus voluntarium. I
shall then turn attention to the NPT Review Conferences, to the relevant
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, and to the Conferences on
the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons. The way will then be
paved for my ﬁnal considerations, on opinio juris communis emanating
from conscience (recta ratio), well above the “will”, — and, last but not
least, to the epilogue (recapitulation)



                            II. The Existence of a Dispute
                                before the Hague Court

                       1. Objective Determination by the Court
  5. May I start by addressing the issue of the existence of a dispute
before the Hague Court. In the jurisprudence constante of the Hague Court
(PCIJ and ICJ), a dispute exists when there is “a disagreement on a point
of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views or of interests between two
persons” 1. Whether there exists a dispute is a matter for “objective deter-
mination” by the Court; the “mere denial of the existence of a dispute
does not prove its non-existence” 2. The Court must examine if “the claim
of one party is positively opposed by the other” 3. The Court further states
that “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views
or interests, or the positive opposition of the claim of one party by the
other need not be necessarily be stated expressis verbis” 4.

   6. Over the last decade, the Court has deemed it ﬁt to insist on its own
faculty to proceed to the “objective determination” of the dispute. Thus,
in the case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Appli-
cation: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction
and Admissibility (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 6), for example, the
ICJ has recalled that, as long ago as 1924, the PCIJ stated that “a dispute
is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views or
interests” (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924,
P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 11). It then added that

        “For its part, the present Court has had occasion a number of times
      to state the following:
            ‘In order to establish the existence of a dispute, ‘it must be
         shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the
         other’ (South West Africa, Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
         I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 328); and further, ‘Whether there exists an
         international dispute is a matter for objective determination’
         (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Roma-
         nia, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74; East
         Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995,

         perty (Liechtenstein v. Germany), Preliminary Objections, Judg-
         ment, I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 18, para. 24)’.” (Armed Activities on
         the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic
         Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility,
         Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 40, para. 90).
  7. Shortly afterwards, in its Judgment on preliminary objections
(of 18 November 2008) in the case of the Application of the Convention on
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Ser-
bia), the ICJ has again recalled that
         “In numerous cases, the Court has reiterated the general rule which
      it applies in this regard, namely: ‘the jurisdiction of the Court must
      normally be assessed on the date of the ﬁling of the act instituting
      proceedings’ (to this eﬀect, see Application of the Convention on the
      Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
      Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
      I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 613, para. 26; Questions of Interpretation
      and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the


620    nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. cançado trindade)

      Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United King-
      dom), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 26,
      para. 44).
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
         (I)t is normally by reference to the date of the ﬁling of the instru-
      ment instituting proceedings that it must be determined whether those
      conditions are met.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
         What is at stake is legal certainty, respect for the principle of equal-
      ity and the right of a State which has properly seised the Court to see
      its claims decided, when it has taken all the necessary precautions to
      submit the act instituting proceedings in time.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
         [T]he Court must in principle decide the question of jurisdiction on
      the basis of the conditions that existed at the time of the institution
      of the proceedings.
         However, it is to be recalled that the Court, like its predecessor, has
      also shown realism and ﬂexibility in certain situations in which the
      conditions governing the Court’s jurisdiction were not fully satisﬁed
      when proceedings were initiated but were subsequently satisﬁed,
      before the Court ruled on its jurisdiction.” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
      2008, pp. 437-438, paras. 79-81.)
  8. More recently, in its Judgment on preliminary objections (of 1 April
2011) in the case of the Application of the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian
Federation) (hereinafter Application of the CERD Convention), the ICJ
saw it ﬁt, once again, to stress:
         “The Court recalls its established case law on that matter, begin-
      ning with the frequently quoted statement by the Permanent Court
      of International Justice in the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions
      case in 1924: ‘A dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact,
      a conﬂict of legal views or of interests between two persons’. (Judg-
      ment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 11). Whether there is a
      dispute in a given case is a matter for ‘objective determination’ by the
      Court (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and
      Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).
      ‘It must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed
      by the other’ (South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v.
      South Africa), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962,
      p. 328); and, most recently, Armed Activities on the Territory of the
      Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo
      v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
      2006, p. 40, para. 90). The Court’s determination must turn on an
      examination of the facts. The matter is one of substance, not of form.
      As the Court has recognized (for example, Land and Maritime Bound-


621    nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. cançado trindade)

      ary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria), Prelimi-
      nary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 315, para. 89), the
      existence of a dispute may be inferred from the failure of a State to
      respond to a claim in circumstances where a response is called for.
      While the existence of a dispute and the undertaking of negotiations
      are distinct as a matter of principle, the negotiations may help demon-
      strate the existence of the dispute and delineate its subject-matter.


         The dispute must in principle exist at the time the Application is
      submitted to the Court (Questions of Interpretation and Application

decided to apply to the facts of the case a higher threshold for the deter-
mination of the existence of a dispute, by proceeding to ascertain whether
the applicant State had given the respondent State prior notice of its
claim and whether the respondent State had opposed it 5. On this basis, it
has concluded that no dispute had arisen between the Contending Parties
(before August 2008). Such new requirement, however, is not consistent
with the PCIJ’s and the ICJ’s jurisprudence constante on the determina-

   10. Now, in the present case of Obligations concerning Negotiations
relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarma-
ment, the three respondent States (India, United Kingdom and Pakistan),
seek to rely on a requirement of prior notiﬁcation of the claim, or the test
of prior awareness of the claim of the applicant State (the Marshall
Islands), for a dispute to exist under the ICJ’s Statute or general interna-

jurisprudence constante as to the existence of a dispute: quite to the con-
trary, the ICJ has made clear that the position or the attitude of a party
can be established by inference 6. Pursuant to the Court’s approach, it is

   6 Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria),

Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 315, para. 89:

not necessary for the respondent to oppose previously the claim by an
express statement, or to express acknowledgment of the existence of a



   11. The respondent States in the present case have made reference to
the Court’s 2011 Judgment in the case of the Application of the CERD
Convention in support of their position that prior notice of the applicant’s
claim is a requirement for the existence of a dispute. Already in my dis-
senting opinion (para. 161) in that case, I criticized the Court’s “formalis-

higher threshold that goes beyond the jurisprudence constante of the PCIJ
and the ICJ itself (cf. supra).


  12. As I pointed out in that dissenting opinion in the case of the Appli-
cation of the CERD Convention,

      92 paragraphs to concede that, in its view, a legal dispute at last
      crystallized, on 10 August 2008 (para. 93), only after the outbreak of
      an open and declared war between Georgia and Russia! I ﬁnd that
      truly extraordinary: the emergence of a legal dispute only after the
      outbreak of widespread violence and war! Are there disputes which
      are quintessentially and ontologically legal, devoid of any political

      reasoning leads the Court, in 70 paragraphs, to uphold the second
      preliminary objection, on the basis of alleged (unfulﬁlled) “precondi-
      tions” of its own construction, in my view at variance with its own
      jurisprudence constante and with the more lucid international legal




   13. Half a decade later, I was hopeful that the Court would distance

tion of the CERD Convention. As it regrettably has not done so, I feel
obliged to reiterate here my dissenting position on the issue, this time in
the present case of Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessa-
tion of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament. In eﬀect,
there is no general requirement of prior notice of the applicant State’s


      stated expressis verbis. In the determination of the existence of a dispute, as in other
      matters, the position or the attitude of a party can be established by inference, what-
      ever the professed view of that party.”

intention to initiate proceedings before the ICJ 7. It should not pass unno-
ticed that the purpose of the need of determination of the existence of a

jurisdiction properly: it is not intended to protect the respondent State,
but rather and more precisely to safeguard the proper exercise of the
Court’s judicial function.

contending parties must ﬁrst “exhaust” diplomatic negotiations before
lodging a case with, and instituting proceedings before, the Court (as a
precondition for the existence of the dispute). There is no such require-
ment in general international law, nor in the ICJ’s Statute, nor in the
Court’s case law. This is precisely what the ICJ held in its Judgment on

Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria: it clearly stated that “Neither in
the Charter nor otherwise in international law is any general rule to be
found to the eﬀect that the exhaustion of diplomatic negotiations consti-
tutes a precondition for a matter to be referred to the Court” (I.C.J.
Reports 1998, p. 303, para. 56).

negotiations, — to discard the concept. In eﬀect, there is no such a
requirement in the UN Charter either, that negotiations would need to be
resorted to or attempted. May I reiterate that the Court’s determination
of the existence of the dispute is not designed to protect the respondent
State(s), but rather to safeguard the proper exercise of its own judicial

tion by the Court, as it recalled in that same Judgment (para. 87), on the
basis of its own jurisprudence constante on the matter.


                2. Existence of a Dispute in the Cas d’Espèce

   16. In the present case opposing the Marshall Islands to Pakistan,
there were two sustained and distinct courses of conduct of the two Con-
tending Parties, evidencing their distinct legal positions (as to the duty of
negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict
and eﬀective international control), which suﬃce for the determination of

with its obligation under customary international law to pursue in good
faith, and bring to a conclusion, negotiations leading to nuclear disarma-
ment in all its aspects under strict and eﬀective international control.

624     nuclear arms and disarmament (diss. op. cançado trindade)

   17. On 14 February 2014, in its declaration at the aforementioned
Conference of Nayarit, the Marshall Islands publicly expressed its view
concerning the obligation on nuclear disarmament. Pakistan did not react
to that declaration, nor did it change its conduct. Thus, one can already
infer an opposition of legal views. In its subsequent submissions to the

in its Note Verbale of 9 July 2014, Pakistan challenged the Mar-
shall Islands’ arguments, referring to what it regarded as an exaggerated
and unfounded interpretation of Article VI of the NPT, which is in its
view inapplicable to States that are not parties to the NPT, and which
does not have an erga omnes character. In its Counter-Memorial, Paki-

legal merit or substance (paras. 4.1-4.6), clearly challenging the legal basis
of the Marshall Islands’ claim (para. 4.5).


     3. The Threshold for the Determination of the Existence of a Dispute

Pakistan, the Court’s majority has unduly heightened the threshold for
establishing the existence of a dispute. Even if dismissing the need for an
applicant State to provide notice of a dispute, in practice, the requirement
stipulated goes far beyond giving notice: the Court eﬀectively requires an
applicant State to set out its legal claim, to direct it speciﬁcally to the

clear. All of this forms part of the “awareness” requirement that the
Court’s majority has laid down, seemingly undermining its own ability to
infer the existence of a dispute from the conﬂicting courses of conduct of
the Contending Parties.



  19. This is not in line with the ICJ’s previous obiter dicta on inference,
contradicting it. For example, in the aforementioned case of Land and
Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (1998), the ICJ stated

         “[A] disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conﬂict of legal views
       or interests, or the positive opposition of the claim of one party by
       the other need not necessarily be stated expressis verbis. In the deter-
       mination of the existence of a dispute, as in other matters, the position
       or attitude of a party can be established by inference, whatever the


  20. The view taken by the Court’s majority in the present case contra-
dicts the Hague Court’s (PCIJ and ICJ) own earlier case law, in which it


has taken a much less formalistic approach to the establishment of the
existence of a dispute. Early in its life, the PCIJ made clear that it did not
attach much importance to “matters of form” 8; it added that it could not
“be hampered by a mere defect of form” 9. The PCIJ further stated that

for instance by diplomatic negotiations, is not required. (. . .) [T]he Court
considers that it cannot require that the dispute should have manifested
itself in a formal way.” 10

formalistic approach to the determination of the existence of a dispute 11.

ICJ has considered that conduct post-dating the critical date (i.e., the date

diction under Article IX of the Convention against Genocide because
there was no dispute between the Parties, the Court, contrariwise, found
that there was a dispute between them, on the basis that Yugoslavia had
“wholly denied all of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s allegations, whether at
the stage of proceedings relating to the requests for the indication of pro-

liminary] objections” 13. Accordingly, “by reason of the rejection by
Yugoslavia of the complaints formulated against it” 14, the ICJ found that
there was a dispute.

parties, the ICJ found that complaints of fact and law formulated by
Liechtenstein were denied by Germany; accordingly, “[i]n conformity
with well-established jurisprudence” — the ICJ concluded — “by virtue
of this denial”, there was a legal dispute between Liechtenstein and Ger-

three cases lodged with the ICJ by the Marshall Islands (against India,

denied the arguments of the Marshall Islands. May we now take note of

part, in its Counter-Memorial, Pakistan discloses a dispute about the
existence of the customary international law obligations asserted by the
Marshall Islands as well as its own compliance with such obligations 18.

   25. In Part 4 of its Counter-Memorial, e.g., Pakistan states that it

of the Marshall Islands that its “claims are based upon: (1) multilateral
treaties to which Pakistan is not a party; (2) non-binding General Assem-
bly resolutions; and (3) a non-binding Advisory Opinion of the Court”.
And it adds:
         “As to (1), although the RMI seeks to present its claims as founded

      said to be ‘rooted’ and ‘enshrined’ in Article VI of the NPT, a treaty
      provision to which the 22-page Application refers at least 15 times.
      Pakistan is not a party to the NPT. As to (2) and (3), due to their
      non-binding status, these cannot give rise to obligations binding on
      Pakistan. None of the above-referenced sources invoked by the RMI



         Even if Pakistan (and the Court) were to accept the facts as alleged
      by the RMI to be true, these do not give rise to any breach by Paki-
      stan and, as explained below, the RMI’s asserted injuries and claims

  26. Always attentive and over-sensitive to the position of
nuclear-weapon States [NWS] (cf. Part XII, infra) — such as the respon-
dent States in the present cases — the Court, in the cas d’espèce, dismisses
the statements made by the Marshall Islands in multilateral fora before

the existence of a dispute. Moreover, the Court’s split majority makes
tabula rasa of the requirement that “in principle” the date for determining
the existence of the dispute is the date of ﬁling of the application (case of
Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Carib-
bean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,

the ICJ has taken into account conduct post-dating that critical date
(cf. supra).
   27. In an entirely formalistic reasoning, the Court borrows the obiter
dicta it made in the case of the Application of the CERD Conven-
tion (2011) — unduly elevating the threshold for the determination of the

Convention (wrongly interpreted anyway, making abstraction of the
object and purpose of the CERD Convention). In the present case, oppos-
ing the Marshall Islands to Pakistan, worse still, the Court’s majority
takes that higher standard out of context, and applies it herein, in a case
lodged with the Court on the basis of an optional clause declaration, and



   28. This attempt to heighten still further the threshold for the determi-
nation of the existence of a dispute (requiring further factual precisions
from the applicant) is, besides formalistic, artiﬁcial: it does not follow

being “a conﬂict of legal views or of interests”, as already seen (cf. supra).
The Court’s majority formalistically requires a speciﬁc reaction of the
respondent State to the claim made by the applicant State (in applying
the criterion of “awareness”, amounting, in my perception, to an obstacle
to access to justice), even in a situation where, as in the cas d’espèce, there

   29. Furthermore, and in conclusion, there is a clear denial by the
respondent States (India, United Kingdom and Pakistan) of the argu-

virtue of these denials there is a legal dispute between the Marshall Islands
and each of the three respondent States. The formalistic raising, by the
Court’s majority, of the higher threshold for the determination of the
existence of a dispute, is not in conformity with the jurisprudence con-
stante of the PCIJ and ICJ on the matter (cf. supra). Furthermore, in my

whole of humankind. This is most regrettable.
