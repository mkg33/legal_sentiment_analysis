                        1. I have voted in favour of the adoption of the present Judgment in
                     the case concerning Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or
                     Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), whereby the International Court of Jus-
                     tice (ICJ) has established violations of Articles 6 (2) and 7 (1) of the
                     1984 United Nations Convention against Torture 1, has asserted the need
                     to take immediately measures to comply with the duty of prosecution
                     under that Convention 2, and has rightly acknowledged that the absolute
                     prohibition of torture is one of jus cogens 3. Although I have agreed with
                     the Court’s majority as to most of the findings of the Court in its present
                     Judgment, there are two points of its reasoning which I do not find satis-
                     factory or consistent with its own conclusions, and on which I have a
                     distinct reasoning, namely, the Court’s jurisdiction in respect of obliga-
                     tions under customary international law, and the handling of the time
                     factor under the UN Convention against Torture. I feel thus obliged
                     to dwell upon them in the present separate opinion, so as to clarify the
                     matter dealt with by the Court, and to present the foundations of my
                     personal position thereon.

                     (a) the factual background of the present case : the regime Habré in Chad
                     (1982‑1990) in the findings of the Chadian Commission of Inquiry
                     (Report of 1992) ; (b) the significance of the decision of 2006 of the
                     UN Committee against Torture ; (c) the clarifications on the case before
                     the ICJ, in the responses to questions put to the contending Parties in the
                     course of the legal proceedings ; and (d) the everlasting quest for the real-
                     ization of justice in the present case.
                        3. At the conceptual and epistemological levels, my reflections in the
                     present separate opinion will focus on : (a) urgency and the needed pro-
                     visional measures of protection in the cas d’espèce ; (b) the acknowledg-
                     ment of the absolute prohibition of torture in the realm of jus cogens ;
                     (c) the obligations erga omnes partes under the UN Convention against
                     Torture ; (d) the gravity of the human rights violations and the compel-
                     ling struggle against impunity (within the law of the United Nations
                     itself) ; (e) the obligations under customary international law ; and (f) the
                     décalage between the time of human justice and the time of human beings
                     revisited (and the need to make time work pro victima).

                       8. Bearing this in mind, the main findings set forth in the Report of the
                     Chadian Truth Commission may here be briefly recalled, for the purposes
                     of the consideration of the cas d’espèce. They pertain to : (a) the organs
                     of repression of the regime Habré in Chad (1982‑1990) ; (b) arbitrary
                     detentions and torture ; (c) the systematic nature of the practice of tor-
                     ture of detained persons ; (d) extra‑judicial or summary executions, and
                     massacres. The corresponding passages of the Report, published in 1993,
                     can be summarized as follows.


                                       1. The Organs of Repression of the Regime Habré
                                                    in Chad (1982-1990)
                        9. According to the aforementioned Report of the Chadian Truth Com-
                     mission, the machinery of repression of the Habré regime in Chad (1982-
                     1990) was erected on the creation and function of four organs of his
                     dictatorship, namely : the Directorate of Documentation and Security
                     (Direction de la documentation et de la sécurité — DDS) or the “political
                     police”, the Service of Presidential Investigation (Service d’investigation pré-
                     sidentielle — SIP), the General Information [Unit] (Renseignements
                     généraux — RG) and the State party (parti‑Etat), called the Union natio-
                     nale pour l’indépendance et la révolution — UNIR). And the Report added :
                                 “All these organs had the mission of controlling the people, keeping
                              them under surveillance, watching their actions and attitudes even in
                              the smallest matters, in order to flush out so-called enemies of the
                              nation and neutralize them permanently.
                                 The DDS is the principal organ of repression and terror. Among
                              all the oppressive institutions of the Habré regime, the DDS distin-
                              guished itself by its cruelty and its contempt for human life. It fully

                     most victims were arbitrarily detained by the DDS, without knowing the
                     charges against them. They were systematically tortured, either for
                     “intimidation” or else as “reprisal” 14. And the Report added that

                                 “Torture was an institutional practice in the DDS. Arrestees were
                               systematically tortured, then kept in tiny cells under terrible and inhu-
                               mane conditions. (. . .) [T]he DDS elevated torture virtually to

                       12. And the Chadian Truth Commission proceeded in its account of
                     the facts it found :
                            “Everyone arrested by the DDS, in N’Djamena or in the provinces,
                          was systematically subjected to at least one interrogation session, fol-
                          lowing which an interrogation report was prepared. Torture being the
                          tool of choice during interrogation, DDS agents resorted to it syste­
                          matically.
                            A number of former DDS detainees told the Commission of Inquiry
                          about the torture and abuse to which they were subjected during their
                          detention. Scars from these tortures and medical examinations have
                          corroborated their testimony.” 16

                        14. In its remaining parts, the Report of the Chadian Truth Commis-
                     sion addressed aggravating circumstances of the oppression of the regime
                     Habré, mainly the intentionality of the atrocities perpetrated. In its own
                     words,
                                 “The Hissein Habré regime was a veritable hecatomb for the Chad-
                               ian people ; thousands of people died, thousands of others suffered in
                               mind and body and continue to suffer.

                                  Throughout this dark reign, in N’Djamena and everywhere else in
                               the country, systematic repression was the rule for all opponents or
                               suspected opponents of the regime.
                                  The possessions of persons arrested or hunted were pillaged and
                               their relatives persecuted. Entire families were decimated.
                                  In the interior, villages were completely burned down and their
                               populations massacred. Nothing was immune to this murderous mad-
                               ness, and the entire country was in a state of terror. (. . .)
                                  Never in the history of Chad have there been so many deaths, never
                               have there been so many innocent victims. When the Commission of
                               Inquiry began its work, it believed that at worst it would be dealing
                               with massacres, but the further it proceeded in its investigations, the
                               larger loomed the dimensions of the disaster, until finally it was a
                               question of extermination. No ethnic group, no tribe, no family was
                               spared, except the Goranes and their allies. The killing machine made
                               no distinction between men, women and children. The mildest protest
                               was equated with revolt and triggered horrible reprisals. The silenced
                               and submissive population watched powerless its own gradual asphyx-
                               iation. Starting in 1982, political prisons sprang up all over Chad, and
                               they were not emptied until the fall of the regime in 1990. In
                               N’Djamena as well as the provinces, arrests were made at a frenetic
                               pace. People were arrested on any pretext, even without any pretext.
                               A slip of the tongue, an old grudge never forgiven by a Gorane or
                               DDS agent, even an incident fabricated of whole cloth was enough
                               for one to find himself in the grim dungeons of the DDS.

                                 In these dungeons, a very large number of people died. The number
                               of political prisoners counted by the Commission of Inquiry for the
                               period 1982-1990 and the number who died during the same period
                               boggle the imagination.” 18
                        15. The Report of the Chadian Truth Commission, published in 1993,
                     was in fact concluded on 7 May 1992, with a series of recommendations 19.
                     Its over‑all assessment was quite sombre. In its own words,
                                  “The record of Habré’s eight-year reign is terrifying. The Commis-
                               sion still wonders how a citizen, a child of the country, could have
                               committed so much evil, so much cruelty, against his own people. The
                               stereotype of the hard-core revolutionary idealist quickly gave way to
                               that of a shabby and sanguinary tyrant.
                                  Recapitulating the evils he has wrought on his fellow citizens, the
                               toll is heavy and the record grim :
                                 —     more than 40,000 victims ;
                                 —     more than 80,000 orphans ;
                                 —     more than 30,000 widows ;
                                 —     more than 200,000 people left with no moral or material sup-
                                       port as the result of this repression.
                                   Add to that the movable and immovable goods plundered and
                               c­ onfiscated from peaceful citizens — an amount estimated at ONE
                                BILLION CFA FRANCS each year.
                                   Eight years of rule, eight years of tyranny (. . .). Why so much evil,
                                so much hatred of his own people ? Was it worth the pain of struggling
                                for a whole decade to win power, just to do that ? For what ideal and
                                to what end was Habré fighting ? (. . .)
                                   The Habré regime and what became of it should serve as a lesson
                                to all Chadians, and in particular to the country’s rulers. A wise man
                                once said : ‘Power is like a shadow, and shadows are never eternal.’ ” 20

                       16. On 18 April 2001, a group of persons who claimed to be victims
                     of torture during the regime Habré in Chad lodged a complaint with
                     the UN Committee against Torture, supervisory organ of the
                     UN ­Convention against Torture (CAT). They did so under Article 22
                     of the CAT, in the exercise of the right of individual complaint or peti-

                        of Souleymane Guengueng and al. v. Senegal. It should not pass
                        ­un­noticed, at this stage, that the Committee was enabled to pronounce
                         on this matter due to the exercise, by the individuals concerned, of their
                         right of complaint or petition at international level.
                            17. Half a decade later, on 19 May 2006, the Committee against Tor-
                      ture adopted a decision, under Article 22 of the CAT, on the case Souley-
                      mane Guengueng and al., concerning the complaints of Chadian nationals
                      living in Chad, who claimed to be victims of a breach by Senegal of
                      ­Articles 5 (2) and 7 of the CAT 22. The Committee did so taking into
                      account the submissions of the complainants and of the respondent State,
                      bearing in mind the factual background of the case as contained in the
                      Report (of May 1992) of the National Commission of Inquiry of
                      the Chadian Ministry of Justice 23. In their complaint lodged with
                      the UN Committee against Torture, the complainants claimed, as to the
                     facts, that, between 1982 and 1990, they were tortured by agents of Chad
                     who answered directly to Mr. H. Habré, the then President of Chad
                     ­during the period at issue.
                            18. The Committee referred to the aforementioned Report by the
                      National Commission of Inquiry established by the Chadian Ministry of
                      Justice (cf. supra), giving account of 40,000 “political murders” and “sys-
                       tematic acts of torture” allegedly committed during the H. Habré regime.
                       The Committee recalled that, after being ousted by Mr. Idriss Déby in
                       December 1990, Mr. H. Habré took refuge in Senegal, where he has been
                       living ever since. The Committee further recalled the initiatives of legal
                       action (from 2000 onwards) against Mr. H. Habré, in Senegal and in
                       Belgium. The Committee then found the communication admissible
                       ­
                       and considered that the principle of universal jurisdiction enunciated in
                       Articles 5 (2) and 7 of the CAT implies that the jurisdiction of States
                       ­parties “must extend to potential complainants in circumstances similar
                        to the complainants” 24.

                       19. As to the merits of the communication in the case Souleymane Guen-


                        21 Article 22 of the CAT has been accepted by both Senegal (on 16 October 1996) and

                     Belgium (on 25 July 1999). To date, 64 of the 150 States parties to the CAT have accepted
                     this optional clause of recognition of the competence of the UN Committee against
                     Torture. For an updated digest of the consideration of complaints under Article 22 of the
                     CAT, cf. UN, Report of the Committee against Torture, 45th‑46th Sessions (2010‑2011),

                        22 CAT, paras. 1.1‑1.3. The Committee (acting under Article 108 (9) of its Rules of

                     Procedure) requested Senegal, as an interim measure, not to expel Mr. H. Habré and to
                     take all necessary measures to prevent him from leaving the country (other than an extradi-
                     tion) — a request to which Senegal acceded.

                     gueng and Others, the Committee, after reviewing the arguments of the
                     parties as to the alleged violations of the relevant provisions of the CAT,
                     noted that Senegal had not contested the fact that it had not taken “such
                     measures as may be necessary” under Article 5 (2). The Committee found
                     that Senegal had not fulfilled its obligations under that provision 25. In
                     reaching this decision, the Committee deemed it fit to warn, in its decision
                     of 19 May 2006, that
                               “the reasonable time-frame within which the State party should have
                               complied with this obligation [under Article 5 (2) of the CAT] has
                               been considerably exceeded” 26.
                        20. As to the alleged breach of Article 7 of the CAT, the Committee
                     noted that “the obligation to prosecute the alleged perpetrator of acts of
                     torture does not depend on the prior existence of a request for his extradi-
                     tion” ; it further observed that the objective of Article 7 is “to prevent any
                     act of torture from going unpunished” 27. The Committee also pondered
                     that Senegal or any other State party “cannot invoke the complexity of its
                     judicial proceedings or other reasons stemming from domestic law to jus-
                     tify its failure to comply with [its] obligations under the Convention” 28.
                     The Committee found that Senegal was under an obligation to prosecute
                     Mr. H. Habré for alleged acts of torture, unless it could demonstrate that
                     there was not sufficient evidence to prosecute (at the time of the com-
                     plainants’ submission of their original complaint of January 2000).

                        21. The Committee recalled that the decision of March 2001 by the
                     Court of Cassation had put an end to any possibility of prosecuting
                     Mr. H. Habré in Senegal, and added that since Belgium’s request of
                     extradition of September 2005, Senegal also had the choice to extradite
                     Mr. H. Habré. As Senegal decided neither to prosecute nor to extradite
                     him, the Committee found that it had failed to perform its obligations
                     under Article 7 of the CAT 29. The Committee then concluded that Sen­
                     egal had violated Articles 5 (2) and 7 of the CAT ; it added that its ­decision
                     in no way influenced the possibility of “the complainants’ obtaining com-
                     pensation through the domestic courts for the State party’s failure to
                     comply with its obligations under the Convention” 30. This decision of the
                     Committee against Torture is, in my view, of particular relevance to the
                     present case before this Court 31.

                                              IV. The Case before the ICJ :
                                 Responses to Questions Put to the Contending Parties

                                                 1. Questions Put to Both Parties
                       22. At the end of the public hearings before this Court, I deemed it fit
                     to put to the two contending Parties, on 16 March 2012, the following
                     questions :
                               “(. . .) First question :
                               1. As to the facts which lie at the historical origins of this case, taking
                               into account the alleged or eventual projected costs of the trial of
                               Mr. Habré in Senegal, what in your view would be the probatory
                               value of the Report of the National Commission of Inquiry of the
                               Chadian Ministry of Justice ?
                               Second question :
                               2. As to the law :
                               — (a) Pursuant to Article 7 (1) of the United Nations Convention
                                 against Torture, how is the obligation to ‘submit the case to its
                                 competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution’ to be inter-
                                 preted ? In your view, are the steps that Senegal alleges to have
                                 taken to date sufficient to fulfil the obligation under Article 7 (1)
                                 of the United Nations Convention against Torture ?

                               — (b) According to Article 6 (2) of the United Nations Convention
                                 against Torture, a State party wherein a person alleged to have
                                 committed an offence (pursuant to Article 4) is present ‘shall
                                 immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts’. How is
                                 this obligation to be interpreted ? In your view, are the steps that
                                 Senegal alleges to have taken to date sufficient to fulfil its obli­
                                 gation under this provision of the United Nations Convention
                                 against Torture ? ” 32



                                                      2. Reponses by Belgium
                        23. Concerning the first question I posed 33, Belgium gave its response
                     on the basis of the relevant rules of Belgian law, and invited Senegal to
                     elaborate on the rules applicable under Senegalese law. Belgium contended

                           CR 2012/5, of 16 March 2012, pp. 42‑43.
                           Namely : “As to the facts which lie at the historical origins of this case, taking into
                     account the alleged or eventual projected costs of the trial of Mr. Habré in Senegal, what
                     in your view would be the probatory value of the Report of the National Commission of
                     Inquiry of the Chadian Ministry of Justice ? ”

                     499 	 obligation to prosecute or extradite (sep. op. cançado trindade)

                     that Belgian law espouses the principle of “liberté de la preuve” in criminal
                     contexts, which, according to Belgium, entails, first, the free choice of evi-
                     dence and, secondly, allows the trial judge to have discretion to assess its
                     probative value. Belgium pointed out that the Belgian Court of Cassation
                     has upheld this principle many times 34. Belgium further argued that the
                      corollary of the principle of “liberté de la preuve” is that of firm conviction,
                      whereby the judge can only uphold the charges in case all the evidence
                      submitted to him by the prosecutor warrants the firm conviction that the
                      individual has committed the offence he is charged with.
                        24. Belgium contended, in addition, that, essentially, any type of evi-
                     dence is thus admissible, as long as it is rational and recognized, by reason
                     and experience, as capable of convincing the judge. Belgium also alleged
                     that, in accordance with the general legal principle of respect for the rights
                     of the defence, any evidence taken into account by the judge in a criminal
                     case must be subjected to adversarial argument. Belgium contended that
                     the judge in a criminal case may take into consideration all the evidence
                     which has been gathered abroad and which has been transmitted to the
                     Belgian authorities, such as, a copy of the Report of the National Com-
                     mission of Inquiry of the Chadian Ministry of Justice (hereinafter : “the
                     Report”), as long as that evidence does not violate the right to a fair trial.
                     Belgium further argued that the judge will determine the legality of the
                     evidence obtained abroad based on the following considerations : whether
                     the foreign law allows the evidence used ; whether or not this evidence is
                     consistent with the rules of international law directly applicable in the
                     domestic courts and with Belgian public policy rules ; and, whether the
                     evidence was obtained in compliance with the foreign law, in so far as the
                     judge has been seised of a dispute in this connection 35.
                        25. Belgium further claimed that when the international arrest warrant
                     against Mr. Habré was issued, the Belgian investigating judge took
                     account, in particular, of the evidence contained in the Report. Thus —
                     to conclude — Belgium argued that, while keeping in mind that it is
                     for the trial judge to rule on the probative value of the Report at issue,
                     it could certainly be used as evidence in proceedings against Mr. Habré.
                     Belgium added that the use of the Report could save a considerable
                     amount of time and money in pursuit of the obligation to prosecute, even
                     if — and Belgium referred to Senegal’s arguments in this regard — it is
                     not possible to point to “lack of funds or difficulties in establishing a
                     ­special budget as exonerating factors” concerning the responsibility of
                      the State which is obliged to prosecute or, failing that, to extradite 36.

                        34 CR 2012/6, of 19 March 2012, p. 21. Belgium argues that the Court of Cassation has

                     found that “in respect of criminal law, when the law does not lay down a particular method
                     of proof, the trial judge in fact assesses the probative value of the evidence, submitted in
                     due form, on which he bases his opinion”, Belgian Court of Cassation, 27 February 2002,

                       26. As to the second question I posed 37, Belgium argued that there are
                     three steps to be taken pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention against
                     Torture (CAT) :
                               “first, to secure the offender’s presence ; second, to conduct, immedi-
                               ately, a preliminary inquiry ; and, third, to notify, immediately, certain
                               States what is going on, including in particular reporting to them its
                               findings following the preliminary inquiry and indicating whether it
                               intends to exercise jurisdiction”.


                     As to the first requirement of Article 6, Belgium argued that it never con-
                     tested that Senegal fulfilled this first step, even though, from time to time,
                     Belgium has had serious concerns about Senegal’s continuing commit-
                     ment to this obligation, given certain statements by high‑level officials of
                     Senegal.
                        27. As concerns Article 6 (2), Belgium argued that Senegal’s counsel
                     did not make arguments in this regard during the oral hearings. Belgium
                     claimed that Article 6 is a common provision in Conventions containing
                     aut dedere aut judicare clauses (as, e.g., in the Hague and Montreal Con-
                     ventions concerning civil aviation), and referred to the United Nations
                     Study of such clauses, to the effect that the preliminary steps set out in the
                     Conventions, including “measures (. . .) to investigate relevant facts”, are
                     indispensable to allow the proper operation of the mechanism for the
                     punishment of offenders in the relevant Conventions. Belgium went on to
                     argue that the nature of the investigation required by Article 6 (2)
                     depended to some extent on the legal system concerned, and the circum-
                     stances of the particular case. It contended, however, that from the struc-
                     ture of the aut dedere aut judicare provisions of the Convention against
                     Torture, the reference to a preliminary inquiry in Article 6 (2) is of the
                     kind of preliminary investigation which precedes the submission of the
                     matter to the prosecuting authorities.



                       28. Belgium claimed that Article 6 (4) makes it clear that the prelimi-
                     nary inquiry should lead to findings, and that the main purpose of the
                     inquiry is to enable the State in whose territory the alleged offender is

                                  “According to Article 6 (2) of the United Nations Convention against
                               Torture, a State party wherein a person alleged to have committed an offence
                               (pursuant to Article 4) is present ‘shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry
                               into the facts’. How is this obligation to be interpreted ? In your view, are the
                               steps that Senegal alleges to have taken to date sufficient to fulfil its obliga-
                               tion under this provision of the United Nations Convention against Torture ?”

                     to report its findings to other interested States so that they may take a
                     decision whether or not to seek extradition. In Belgium’s submission,


                               “[t]he preliminary inquiry referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, thus
                               requires the gathering of first pieces of evidence and information,
                               sufficient to permit an informed decision by the competent authorities
                               of the territorial State whether a person should be charged with a
                               serious criminal offence and brought to justice” 38.

                     Belgium concluded by claiming that there is no information before the
                     Court speaking to any preliminary inquiry on the part of Senegal.

                        29. As to my question concerning the interpretation of Article 7 39, Bel-
                     gium first argued that the obligation under Article 7 (1) is closely related
                     to the obligations under Articles 5 (2), and 6 (2) of the CAT — which in
                     its view Senegal has also violated — and Belgium further claimed in this
                     regard that “the breach of Article 7 flowed from the breach of the other
                     two provisions”. Belgium explained that

                               “[t]he absence of the necessary legislation, in clear breach of Article 5,
                               paragraph 2, until 2007/2008 meant that Senegal’s prosecutorial
                               efforts were doomed to failure. So the prosecutorial efforts under-
                               taken in 2000 and 2001 cannot be seen as fulfilling the obligation laid
                               down in Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Convention.” 40

                               gathering evidence, such as interrogation of the alleged torturer, taking witness testi-

                     502 	 obligation to prosecute or extradite (sep. op. cançado trindade)

                        30. Belgium claimed that the obligation in Article 7 of the CAT “to
                     submit the case to the competent authorities for the purpose of prosecu-
                     tion” is carefully worded as it would not seem realistic “to prosecute
                     whenever allegations are made”. In this regard, Belgium argued that :


                                 “What can be required is that the case is submitted to the
                               prosecuting authorities for the purpose of prosecution ; and that
                               those authorities ‘shall take their decision in the same manner as
                               the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature’ — in paragraph 2
                               of Article 7, with which paragraph 1 should be read, provides.
                               What is at issue here, in particular, is the need for the prosecuting
                               authorities to decide whether the available evidence is sufficient for a
                               prosecution.” 41
                       31. Belgium then referred to the negotiating history of Article 7 and
                     argued that the same language is now found in many of the aut dedere aut
                     judicare clauses that follow the Hague Convention 42 model, including the
                     CAT. Referring to the travaux préparatoires of the latter, Belgium argued
                     that it was decided that the language should follow the “well‑established
                     language” of the Hague Convention 43. Belgium also claimed that “the
                     fact that there is no absolute requirement to prosecute does not mean that
                     the prosecuting authorities have total discretion, and that a State may
                     simply do nothing”, and contended that, like any other international obli-
                     gation, it must be performed in good faith.


                        32. Belgium referred to the object and purpose of the CAT stated in its
                     concluding preambular paragraph “to make more effective the struggle
                     against torture” which means, in its view, that the prosecuting authorities
                     start “a prosecution if there is sufficient evidence, and that they do so in a
                     timely fashion”. After referring to expert writing on the travaux prépara-
                     toires of the Hague Convention, for guidance in the interpretation of
                     Article 7 of the CAT 44, Belgium concluded that Senegal is in breach of its
                     obligation under Article 7 of the CAT, notwithstanding the fact that the
                     prosecuting authorities acted in the year 2000, without success, which in
                     its view was not sufficient to fulfil its obligations under the CAT.

                       33. Belgium further contended that, since 2000‑2001, Senegal has taken
                     no action to submit any of the allegations against Mr. H. Habré to the
                     prosecuting authorities, a fact which Belgium submitted to be a

                               “matter of particular concern given that the allegations against
                               Mr. H. Habré were renewed in the Belgian extradition request of
                               2005, and in the further complaint laid in Senegal in 2008, not to
                               speak of the information now publicly available concerning the crimes
                               that have been committed when Hissène Habré was in power in Chad,
                               and for which he allegedly bears responsibility” 45.


                                                    3. Responses by Senegal
                         34. In respect of my first question (supra), Senegal pointed out, as far
                      as the pertinent provisions of domestic law in force in Senegal are con-
                      cerned, that the Report of the Chadian Truth Commission “can only be
                      used for information purposes and is not binding on the investigating
                      judge who, in the course of his investigations conducted by means of an
                      international letter rogatory, may endorse or disregard it”. Senegal added
                      that the Report is not binding on the trial judge examining the merits of
                      the case, and thus the value of the Report is “entirely relative” 46.
                         35. As to my second question (supra), Senegal argued that, even before
                     it adhered to the CAT, it had already endeavoured to punish torture, and
                     as such it had established its jurisdiction in relation to Article 5 (3) of the
                     Convention, on the basis of which Mr. Habré was indicted in 2000 by the
                     senior investigating judge when the competent Senegalese authorities had
                     been seised with complaints. Senegal further claims that pursuant to
                     ­Article 7 (3) of the Convention, Mr. Habré “was able to avail himself
                      of the means of redress made available by Senegalese law to any indi­
                      vidual implicated in proceedings before criminal courts, without distinc-
                      tion of nationality, on the same basis as the civil parties” 47.


                        36. Senegal also added that, further to the judgment of 20 March 2001
                     of the Court of Cassation, and the mission of the Committee against Tor-
                     ture in 2009, Senegal adapted its legislation to the other provisions of the
                     CAT. Senegal further claimed that the investigating judge, in criminal
                     proceedings, may be seised either by a complaint with civil-party applica-
                     tion or by an application from the public prosecutor to open an investiga-
                     tion. Concerning the preliminary inquiry, Senegal claimed that its aim
                     is to establish the basic facts and that it does not necessarily lead to

                     p
                     inquiry, decide that there are no grounds for further proceedings 48.

                        37. Senegal further claimed that the CAT does not contain a “general
                     obligation to combat impunity” as a legal obligation with the effect of
                     requiring universal jurisdiction to be established and that an obligation of
                     result is not in question, “since the fight against impunity is a process hav-
                     ing prosecution or extradition as possible aims under the said Conven-
                     tion”. Senegal questioned the purpose of establishing universal jurisdiction
                     in the case of a State which already has a legal entitlement to exercise
                     territorial jurisdiction, which, in its view, is the most obvious principle in
                     cases of competing jurisdiction. Senegal recalled that, in 2009, it estab-
                     lished its jurisdiction concerning offences covered by the CAT.


                         38. Senegal further recalled the Court’s Order on the request for provi-
                     sional measures of 2009 to the effect that the Parties seemed to differ on
                     the “time frame within which the obligations provided for in Article 7
                     must be fulfilled or [on the] circumstances (financial, legal or other diffi-
                     culties)”. Senegal argues that the obligation aut dedere aut judicare
                     remains an obligation either to extradite or, in the alternative, to
                     ­prosecute, given that international law does not appear to “give prior­ity
                      to either alternative course of action”. 49
                         39. Senegal contended, moreover, that “[t]he obligation to try, on
                      account of which Senegal has been brought before the Court, cannot be
                      conceived as an obligation of result” but rather an obligation of means,
                      where “the requirement of wrongfulness is fulfilled only if the State to
                      which the source of the obligation is attributable has not deployed all the
                      means or endeavours that could legitimately be expected of it in order to
                      achieve the results expected by the authors of the rule”. Senegal referred
                      to some international jurisprudence and argued that international law
                      does not impose obligations of result on member States.
                         40. Senegal concluded by arguing that the measures it has taken thus
                      far are largely sufficient and satisfy the obligations laid down in Arti-
                      cles 6 (2) and 7 (1) of the CAT. Senegal thus argued that once it

                               “undertook major reforms to allow the trial to be held, including
                               constitutional reforms, it may be considered to have satisfied its obli-
                               gation of means or of ‘best efforts’, so as not to give the appearance
                               of a State heedless and not desirous of implementing its conventional
                               obligations. It may not have done this to a sufficient extent, but it has
                               made sufficient progress in terms of acting to achieve such a result.” 50

                                               4. General Assessment
                       41. In the light of the aforementioned, it is significant that, for the
                     arrest warrant against Mr. Habré, the evidence contained in the Report
                     of the Chadian Truth Commission was taken into account by the Belgian
                     investigating judge. Furthermore — as also pointed out by Belgium —
                     that Report can certainly be taken into account as evidence in legal pro-
                     ceedings against Mr. H. Habré, it being for the trial judge or the tribunal
                     to rule on its probative value. Senegal itself acknowledged that the Report
                     at issue can be taken into account for information purposes, without
                     being “binding” on the investigating judge ; it is for the judge (or the tri-
                     bunal) to rule on it.


                        42. There thus seems to be a disagreement between Belgium and Sen­
                     egal as to the consideration of the evidence considered in the Report. In
                     any case, the Report cannot be simply overlooked or ignored, it cannot
                     be examined without care. It is to be examined together with all other
                     pieces of evidence that the investigating judge or the tribunal succeeds in
                     having produced before him/it, for the purpose of ruling on the matter at
                     issue. The present case concerns ultimately a considerable total of victims,
                     those murdered, or arbitrarily detained and tortured, during the Habré
                     regime in Chad (1982‑1990).
                        43. As to the answers provided by the contending Parties to my ques-
                     tions addressed to them, whether in their view the steps that Senegal
                     alleges to have taken to date were sufficient to fulfil its obligations under
                     Articles 6 (2) and 7 (1) of the UN Convention against Torture, an assess-
                     ment of such answers ensues from the consideration of the doctrinal
                     debate on the dichotomy between alleged obligations of means or con-
                     duct, and obligations of result. I am of the view that the obligations under
                     a treaty of the nature of the UN Convention against Torture are not, as
                     the respondent State argues, simple obligations of means or conduct :
                     they are obligations of result, as we are here in the domain of peremptory
                     norms of international law, of jus cogens. I feel obliged to expand on the
                     foundations of my personal position on this matter.

                     tional Responsibility of the State, Roberto Ago, proposed the distinction
                     between obligations of conduct and of result, some members of the ILC
                     expressed doubts as to the viability of distinguishing between the two
                     types of obligation ; after all, in order to achieve a given result, the State
                     ought to assume a given behaviour 53. In any case, obligations of result
                     admitted the initial free choice by the State of the means to comply with
                     them, of obtaining the results due.

                        46. The aforementioned distinction between the two kinds of obliga-
                     tions introduced a certain hermeticism into the classic doctrine on the
                     matter, generating some confusion, and not appearing very helpful in the
                     domain of the international protection of human rights. Despite refer-
                     ences to a couple of human rights treaties, the essence of Roberto Ago’s
                     reasoning, developed in his dense and substantial Reports on the Interna-
                     tional Responsibility of the State, had in mind above all the framework of
                     essentially inter‑State relations. The ILC itself, in the Report of 1977 on
                     its work, at last reckoned that a State party to a human rights treaty has

                     obligations of result, and, if it does not abide by them, it cannot excuse
                     itself by alleging that it has done all that it could to comply with them,
                     that it has behaved in the best way to comply with them ; on the contrary,
                     such State has the duty to attain the result required of it by the conven-
                     tional obligations of protection of the human person.

                        47. Such binding obligations of result (under human rights treaties) are
                     much more common in international law than in domestic law. The con-
                     fusion generated by the dichotomy of obligations of conduct and of result
                     has been attributed to the undue transposition into international law of a
                     distinction proper to civil law (droit des obligations) ; rather than “import-
                     ing” inadequately distinctions from other branches of law or other
                     domains of legal theory, in my view one should rather seek to ensure that
                     the behaviour of States is such that it will abide by the required result, of
                     securing protection to human beings under their respective jurisdictions.
                     Human rights treaties have not had in mind the dichotomy at issue, which
                     is vague, imprecise, and without practical effect.


                        48. It is thus not surprising to find that the distinction between so‑called
                     obligations of conduct and of result was discarded from the approved
                     2001 draft of the ILC on the International Responsibility of States, and
                     was met with criticism in expert writing 54. Moreover, it failed to have any
                     significant impact on international case law. The ECHR, for example,
                     held in the case of Colozza and Rubinat v. Italy (judgment of 12 February
                     1985), that the obligation under Article 6 (1) of the European Convention
                     of Human Rights was one of result. For its part, the ICJ, in the case of
                     the “Hostages” (United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran,
                     Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980), ordered the respondent State to comply
                     promptly with its obligations, which were “not merely contractual”, but
                     rather imposed by general international law (para. 62) ; the ICJ singled
                     out “the imperative character of the legal obligations” incumbent upon
                     the respondent State (para. 88), and added that

                          United Nations, as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated
                          in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” (Para. 91.)
                        49. One of such principles is that of respect of the dignity of the human
                     person. Thus, in so far as the safeguard of the fundamental rights of the
                     human person is concerned, the obligations of the State — conventional
                     and of general international law — are of result, and not of simple con-
                     duct, so as to secure the effective protection of those rights. The absolute
                     prohibition of grave violations of human rights (such as torture) entails
                     obligations which can only be of result, endowed with a necessarily objec-
                     tive character, and the whole conceptual universe of the law of the inter-
                     national responsibility of the State has to be reassessed in the framework
                     of the international protection of human rights 55, encompassing the ori-
                     gin as well as the implementation of State responsibility, with the conse-
                     quent and indispensable duty of reparation.


                        50. In the framework of the international law of human rights —
                     wherein the UN Convention against Torture is situated — it is not the
                     result that is conditioned by the conduct of the State, but, quite on the
                     contrary, it is the conduct of the State that is conditioned by the attainment
                     of the result aimed at by the norms of protection of the human person. The
                     conduct of the State ought to be the one which is conducive to compli-
                     ance with the obligations of result (in the cas d’espèce, the proscription of
                     torture). The State cannot allege that, despite its good conduct, insuffi-
                     ciencies or difficulties of domestic law rendered impossible the full com-
                     pliance with its obligation (to outlaw torture and to prosecute perpetrators
                     of it) ; and the Court cannot consider a case terminated, given the alleg-
                     edly “good conduct” of the State concerned.

                        51. This would be inadmissible ; we are herein before obligations of
                     result. To argue otherwise would amount to an exercise of legal formal-
                     ism, devoid of any meaning, that would lead to a juridical absurdity, ren-
                     dering dead letter the norms of protection of the human person. In sum
                     and conclusion on this point, the absolute prohibition of torture is, as
                     already seen, one of jus cogens ; in an imperative law, conformed by the
                     corpus juris of the international protection of the fundamental rights
                     of the human person, the corresponding obligations of the State are
                     ineluctable, imposing themselves per se, as obligations necessarily of
                     result.

                                            in the Present Case

                        52. With these clarifications in mind, it would be helpful to proceed, at
                     this stage, to a brief view of the long‑standing endeavours, throughout
                     several years, to have justice done, in relation to the grave breaches of
                     human rights and international humanitarian law reported to have
                     occurred during the Habré regime (1982‑1990). Those endeavours com-
                     prise legal actions in domestic courts, requests of extradition (at inter‑State
                     level), some other initiatives at international level, and an initiative of
                     entities of the African civil society. The way would then be paved for a
                     brief review of the initiatives and endeavours to the same effect of the
                     African Union in particular, given its influence in the orientation of the
                     conduction of international affairs in the African continent.


                                        1. Legal Actions in Domestic Courts
                         53. On 25‑26 January 2000 the first complaints were lodged by Chad-
                     ian nationals in Dakar, Senegal, against Mr. Hissène Habré, accusing him
                     of the practice of torture (crimes against humanity). On 3 February 2000
                     a Senegalese judge, after hearing the victims, indicted Mr. H. Habré, and
                     placed him under house arrest. But on 4 July 2000 the Dakar Appeals
                     Court dismissed the indictment, ruling that Senegalese courts had no
                     jurisdiction to pursue the charges because the crimes were not committed
                     in Senegal.
                         54. On 30 November 2000, new complaints were filed against
                     Mr. H. Habré, this time in Brussels, by Chadian victims living in Bel-
                     gium. On 20 March 2001, Senegal’s Appeals Court stood by its view, in
                     ruling that Mr. H. Habré could not stand trial because the alleged crimes
                     were not committed in Senegal. In 2002 (26 February to 7 March), a Bel-
                     gian investigating judge (juge d’instruction), in a visit to Chad, inter-
                     viewed victims and former accomplices of Mr. H. Habré, visited detention
                     centres and mass graves, and took custody of DDS documents. At the
                     end of a four‑year investigation, on 19 September 2005, he issued
                     an international arrest warrant in absentia in respect of Mr. H. Habré.
                     ­Senegal, however, refused to extradite him to Belgium.
                         55. Parallel to new developments — at international level — from the
                      end of 2005 to date, at domestic level new complaints were filed,
                      on 16 September 2008, against Mr. H. Habré in Senegal, accusing him
                      again of the practice of torture (crimes against humanity). Earlier on,
                      on 31 January 2007, Senegal’s National Assembly adopted a law
                      allowing Senegalese courts to prosecute cases of genocide, crimes against
                      humanity, war crimes and torture, even when committed outside of
                      ­Senegal (thus removing a previous legal obstacle) ; it later amended its
                       constitution.

                                                 2. Requests of Extradition
                        56. To the above initiatives of legal actions at domestic law level, four
                     requests by Belgium to date, of extradition of Mr. H. Habré, are to be
                     added. As to the first Belgian request of extradition, of 22 May 2005, the
                     Dakar Appeals Court decided, on 25 November 2005, that it lacked juris-
                     diction to deal with it. On 15 March 2011, Belgium presented a second
                     extradition request, declared inadmissible by the Dakar Appeals Court in
                     its decision of 18 August 2011. Later on, a third extradition request by
                     Belgium, of 5 September 2011, was again declared inadmissible by the
                     Dakar Appeals Courts in its decision of 10 January 2012. Belgium
                     promptly lodged a fourth extradition request (same date). To those
                     requests for extradition, one could add the whole of the diplomatic cor-
                     respondence exchanged between Belgium and Senegal, reproduced in the
                     dossier of the present case 56 before this Court.

                         57. On 24 January 2006 the African Union (AU), meeting in Khar-
                     toum, set up a “Committee of Eminent African Jurists”, to examine the
                     H. Habré case and the options for his trial. In its following session, after
                     hearing the report of that Committee, the AU, on 2 July 2006, asked
                     ­Senegal to prosecute H. Habré “on behalf of Africa”. In the meantime,
                      on 18 May 2006, the UN Committee against Torture found, in the Sou-
                      leymane Guengueng and al. case (supra) that Senegal violated the CAT 57
                      and called on Senegal to prosecute or to extradite Mr. H. Habré. Shortly
                      after the ICJ’s Order of 28 May 2009 in the present case opposing Bel-
                      gium to Senegal, the President and another member of the UN Commit-
                      tee against Torture embarked on an unprecedented visit in situ to Senegal,
                      from 4 to 7 August 2009, to seek the application of the Committee’s own
                      decision of May 2006 in the cas d’espèce.


                        58. In the meantime, on 11 August 2008, a Chadian national residing
                     in Switzerland (Mr. Michelot Yogogombaye) lodged an application
                     against Senegal before the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights
                     (AfCHPR) with a view to suspend the “ongoing proceedings” aiming to
                     “charge, try and sentence” Mr. Hissène Habré. On 15 December 2009,
                     the AfCHPR decided that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the applica-
                     tion at issue, since Senegal had not made a declaration accepting the juris-
                     diction of the AfCHPR to hear such applications, pursuant to

                          56Cf. Annexes to Belgium’s Memorial, Vol. II, of 1 July 2010, docs. B.1‑26.
                          57This was the first time the Committee found a breach of the duty to prosecute
                     (Article 7 of the CAT), in a decision that has been seen as corresponding to “the letter,
                     spirit and purpose of Article 7, namely, to avoid safe havens for torturers” ; M. Nowak,

                     Article 34 (6) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peo-
                     ples’ Rights (on the establishment of the AfCHPR).
                       59. In the period 2008‑2010, moreover, given Senegal’s refusal to pre-
                     pare for the trial of Mr. H. Habré unless it received full funding for it, the
                     European Union and the AU sent successive delegations to negotiate on
                     the issue with Senegal. In the meantime, on 18 November 2010, the
                     ECOWAS Court of Justice ruled that Senegal ought to try Mr. H. Habré
                     by a special jurisdiction or an ad hoc tribunal, to be created for that pur-
                     pose. On 24 November 2010, a donors’ international roundtable held in
                     Dakar secured the full funding to cover all the estimated costs of the pro-
                     ceedings of the trial of Mr. H. Habré 58. Shortly afterwards, on 31 Janu-
                     ary 2011, the AU called for the “expeditious” start of the trial of
                     Mr. H. Habré, on the basis of the ECOWAS Court decision (cf. infra).

                        60. On 24 November 2011, the rapporteur of the CAT on the follow‑up
                     of communications (or petitions) sent a letter to the Permanent Mission
                     of Senegal to the United Nations, reminding it of its obligation aut dedere
                     aut judicare under the Convention, and took note of the fact that, until
                     then, no proceedings had been initiated by Senegal against Mr. H. Habré.
                     Earlier on, on 12 January 2011, the same rapporteur had sent another
                     letter to Senegal’s Permanent Mission to the UN, recalling the State par-
                     ty’s obligation under Article 7 (1) of the CAT, now that the full funding
                     for the trial of Mr. H. Habré had been secured (supra).


                         61. For its part, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human
                     Rights (OHCHR) also expressed its concern with the delays in opening
                     up the trial of Mr. H. Habré ; on 18 March 2011, the OHCHR urged
                     ­Senegal to comply with its duty of prosecution 59. Later on, the OHCHR
                      requested Senegal not to extradite (as then announced) Mr. H. Habré to
                      Chad (where he had already been sentenced to death in absentia), ponder-
                      ing that “[j]ustice and accountability are of paramount importance and
                      must be attained through a fair process and in accordance with human
                      rights law” 60. Shortly afterwards, the OHCHR warned, on 12 July 2011,
                     that Mr. H. Habré was


                          “continuing to live with impunity in Senegal, as he has done for the
                          past 20 years. It is important that rapid and concrete progress is made

                               all along. It is also the position of the African Union (AU), as well
                               as of much of the rest of the international community. It is a violation
                               of international law to shelter a person who has committed torture or
                               other crimes against humanity, without prosecuting or extraditing
                               him.” 61

                         62. In addition to these three exhortations (of the UN Committee
                      against Torture itself, the African Union, and the rapporteur of
                      the CAT), on 21 July 2010, Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop
                     ­Desmond Tutu and Shirin Ebadi, among others, as well as 117 African
                      human rights groups from 25 African countries, likewise called upon Sen-
                      egal to move forward with the trial of Mr. H. Habré, for political killings
                      and the systematic practice of torture, after more than 20 years of alleged
                      difficulties to the detriment of the victims 62.

                       63. In their call for the fair trial of Mr. H. Habré, Archbishop D. Tutu
                     and the other signatories stated :
                                 “We, the undersigned NGOs and individuals urge Senegal rapidly
                               to begin legal proceedings against the exiled former Chadian dictator
                               Hissène Habré, who is accused of thousands of political killings and
                               systematic torture from 1982 to 1990.

                                  The victims of Mr. Habré’s regime have been working tirelessly for
                               20 years to bring him to justice, and many of the survivors have
                               already died. (. . .) Instead of justice, the victims have been treated to
                               an interminable political and legal soap opera (. . .).” 63
                       64. After recalling the facts of the victims’ quest for justice, they stated
                     that a fair trial for Mr. H. Habré in Senegal “should be a milestone”
                     in the fight to hold “the perpetrators of atrocities (. . .) accountable for
                     their crimes”. They added that this would moreover show that “African
                     courts are sovereign and capable of providing justice for African victims
                     for crimes committed in Africa”. They thus urged the authorities “to
                     choose justice, not impunity, and to move quickly towards the trial
                     of Hissène Habré” 64.

                                Initiatives and Endeavours of the African Union

                        65. The above review, to be completed, requires closer attention to be
                     paid to the initiatives and endeavours of the African Union (reflected in
                     the Decisions adopted by its Assembly), in the same search for justice in
                     the Hissène Habré case. Thus, at its sixth ordinary session, held in Khar-
                     toum, Sudan, the Assembly of the African Union adopted its Deci-
                     sion 103 (VI), on 24 January 2006, wherein it decided to establish a
                     Committee of Eminent African Jurists “to consider all aspects and impli-
                     cations of the Hissène Habré case as well as the options available for his
                     trial” 65. It requested the aforementioned Committee to submit a report at
                     the following Ordinary Session in July 2006.


                        66. At its seventh ordinary session, held in Banjul, Gambia, the Assem-
                     bly of the African Union adopted its Decision 127 (VII), on 2 July 2006,
                     whereby it took note of the report presented by the Committee of Emi-
                     nent African Jurists. It noted that, pursuant to Articles 3 (h), 4 (h) and
                     4 (o) of the Constitutive Act of the African Union, “the crimes of which
                     Hissène Habré is accused fall within the competence of the African
                     Union”. Furthermore, the Assembly of the African Union mandated the
                     Republic of Senegal “to prosecute and ensure that Hissène Habré is tried,
                     on behalf of Africa, by a competent Senegalese court with guarantees for
                     fair trial”.
                        67. At its eighth ordinary session, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the
                     Assembly of the African Union adopted Decision 157 (VIII), on 30 Janu-
                     ary 2007, whereby the African Union commended Senegal for its efforts
                     on “the implementation of the Banjul Decision”, encouraged it “to pur-
                     sue its initiatives to accomplish the mandate entrusted to it”, and appealed
                     to the international community to mobilize the financial resources
                     required for the trial. Two years later, at its twelfth ordinary session, held
                     again in Addis Ababa, from 1 to 3 February 2009, the Assembly of the
                     African Union adopted Decision 240 (XII), whereby it called on “all
                     Member States of the African Union, the European Union and partner
                     countries and institutions to make their contributions to the budget of the
                     case by paying these contributions directly to the African Union Com-
                     mission”.

                     from 1 to 3 July 2009, the Assembly of the African Union adopted Deci-
                     sion 246 (XIII), whereby it reiterated its “appeal to all Member States to

                      27 July 2010, to the same effect.

                        69. At its sixteenth ordinary session, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
                     on 30-31 January 2011, the Assembly of the African Union adopted Deci-
                     sion 340 (XVI), whereby it confirmed “the mandate given by the African
                     Union (AU) to Senegal to try Hissène Habré”. Furthermore, it welcomed
                     the conclusions of the Donors Round Table concerning the funding of
                     Mr. Habré’s trial and called on Member States, all partner countries and
                     relevant institutions to disburse the funds pledged at the Donors Round

                     modalities for the expeditious trial of Hissène Habré through a special
                     tribunal with an international character”.

                     Guinea, the Assembly of the African Union adopted Decision 371 (XVII),
                     on 1 July 2011, whereby it reiterated its decision (of January 2011) “con-
                     firming the mandate given to Senegal to try Hissène Habré on behalf of
                     Africa”. The Assembly of the African Union urged Senegal
                          “to carry out its legal responsibility in accordance with the United
                          Nations Convention against Torture, the decision of the United
                          Nations (UN) Committee against Torture, as well as the said mandate
                          to put Hissène Habré on trial expeditiously or extradite him to any
                          other country willing to put him on trial”.
                     Next, at its eighteenth ordinary session, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
                     on 29-30 January 2012, the Assembly of the African Union adopted Deci-
                     sion 401 (XVIII), whereby it requested the
                          “Commission to continue consultations with partner countries and
                          institutions and the Republic of Senegal and subsequently with the
                          Republic of Rwanda with a view to ensuring the expeditious trial of
                          Hissène Habre and to consider the practical modalities as well as the
                          legal and financial implications of the trial”.

                       66 It also invited the partner countries and institutions to take part in the Donors

                     Round Table, scheduled to be held in Dakar, Senegal.

                        71. As it can be apprehended from the aforementioned decisions, the
                     African Union has been giving attention to the Hissène Habré case on a
                     consistent basis, since 2006. Although the African Union does not have
                     adjudicatory powers, it has felt obliged to assist Senegal in the pursuit of
                     its obligation to bring Mr. H. Habré to justice ; it thus appears to give its
                     own contribution, as an international organization, to the rule of law (at
                     national and international levels) and to the corresponding struggle
                     against impunity. One can note that, as time progressed, the language of
                     the decisions of the Assembly of the African Union has gradually
                     strengthened.
                        72. This is evidenced, in particular, by the language utilized in its deci-
                     sion 371 (XVII), adopted on 1 July 2011, wherein the Assembly of the
                     African Union reiterated its previous decision “confirming the mandate
                     given to Senegal to try Hissène Habré on behalf of Africa”, and urged
                     Senegal “to carry out its legal responsibility” in accordance with the
                     UN Convention against Torture, the decision adopted by the UN Com-
                     mittee against Torture, as well as “the said mandate to put Hissène Habré
                     on trial expeditiously or extradite him to any other country willing to put
                     him on trial” 67. The emphasis shifted from the collection of funds for the
                     projected trial of Mr. H. Habré to the urgency of Senegal’s compliance
                     with its duty of prosecution, in conformity with the relevant provisions of
                     the UN Convention against Torture.


                                        VIII. Urgency and the Needed Provisional
                                                 Measures of Protection

                        73. In the period which followed the ICJ decision (Questions relating
                     to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), Order of
                     28 May 2009, I.C.J. Reports 2009), not to order provisional measures,
                     Senegal’s pledge before the Court to keep Mr. H. Habré under house
                     surveillance and not to allow him to leave Senegal pending its
                     much‑awaited trial seemed at times to have been overlooked, if not for-
                     gotten. First, concrete moves towards the trial were not made, amidst
                     allegations of lack of full funding (which was secured on 24 November
                     2010). Next, in early July 2011, Senegal announced that Mr. H. Habré
                     would be returned to Chad on 11 July 2011 (where he had been sentenced
                     to death in absentia by a court for allegedly planning to overthrow the
                     Government).

                       74. In its Order of 28 May 2009, the ICJ had refrained from indicating
                     the provisional measures of protection, given Senegal’s assurance that it
                     would not permit Mr. H. Habré to leave the country before the ICJ had
                     given its final decision on the case (ibid., p. 155, para. 71) ; the ICJ then


                          67   Emphasis added.

                     516 	 obligation to prosecute or extradite (sep. op. cançado trindade)

                     found that there was not “any urgency” to order provisional measures in
                     the present case (I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 155, para. 73). Yet, on 8 July
                     2011, the then President of Senegal (Mr. A. Wade) wrote to the Govern-
                     ment of Chad and to the African Union to announce the imminent expul-
                     sion of Mr. H. Habré back to Chad, scheduled for 11 July 2011 (supra).
                     On the eve of that date, Senegal officially retracted its decision, on 10 July
                     2011, given the international outcry that promptly followed, including
                     from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 68.

                        75. Had the return of Mr. H. Habré to Chad been effected by Senegal
                     in such circumstances, it would have been carried out in breach of the
                     principle of good faith (bona fides). The fact that it was seriously consid-
                     ered, and only cancelled in the last minute under public pressure, is suffi-
                     cient reason for serious concern. There is one lesson to be extracted from
                     all that has happened in the present case since the Court’s unfortunate
                     Order of 28 May 2009 : I was quite right in casting a solitary and exten-
                     sive dissenting opinion appended to it, sustaining the need for the order-
                     ing or indication of provisional measures of protection, given the urgency
                     of the situation, and the possibility of irreparable harm (which were evi-
                     dent to me, already at that time).
                        76. A promise of a Government (any Government, of any State any-
                     where in the world) does not suffice to efface the urgency of a situation,
                     particularly when fundamental rights of the human person (such as the
                     right to the realization of justice) are at stake. The ordering of provisional
                     measures of protection has the additional effect of dissuading a State not
                     to incur into a breach of treaty. It thus serves the prevalence of the rule of
                     law at international level. The present case leaves a lesson : the ordering
                     of provisional measures of protection, guaranteeing the rule of law, may
                     well dissuade governmental behaviour to avoid further incongruencies
                     and not to incur what might become additional breaches of international
                     law.
                        77. In my extensive dissenting opinion appended to the Court’s Order
                     of 28 May 2009, I insisted on the issuance of provisional measures
                     of ­protection, given the manifest urgency of the situation affecting
                     the ­surviving victims of torture (or their close relatives) during the
                     Habré regime in Chad (ibid., pp. 183-186, paras. 50‑59), and the pro­
                     bability of irreparable damage ensuing from the breach of the right
                     to the realization of justice (ibid., pp. 186-188, paras. 60‑65). After all,
                     the present case had been lodged with the Court under the UN Con­
                     vention against Torture. Ever since, I have never seen any persuasive
                     argument in support of the decision not to order provisional measures
                     in the present case. All that has been said so far revolves around an
                     empty petitio principii : the Court’s decision was the right one, as was

                     taken by a large majority (the traditional argument of authority, the
                     ­Diktat).

                        78. The fact is that majorities, however large they happen to be, at
                     times also incur mistakes, and this is why I am more inclined to abide by
                     the authority of the argument, rather than vice versa. My position is that
                     the Court should have ordered the provisional measures of protection in
                     its decision of 28 May 2009, having thus assumed the role of g­ uarantee of
                     the relevant norms of the UN Convention against Torture. It should have
                     gone beyond the short‑sighted inter‑State outlook, so as to behold the
                     fundamental rights of the human person that were (and are) at stake in
                     the present case, under the UN Convention against Torture.

                        79. Unilateral acts of States — such as, inter alia, promise — were con-
                     ceptualized in the traditional framework of the inter‑State relations, so as
                     to extract their legal effects, given the “decentralization” of the interna-
                     tional legal order. Here, in the present case, we are in an entirely distinct
                     context, that of objective obligations established under a normative Con-
                     vention — one of the most important of the United Nations, in the
                     domain of the international protection of human rights, embodying an
                     absolute prohibition of jus cogens —, the UN Convention against Tor-
                     ture. In the ambit of these obligations, a pledge or promise made in the
                     course of legal proceedings before the Court does not remove the pre­
                     requisites (of urgency and of probability of irreparable damage) for the
                     indication of provisional measures by the Court.

                       80. This is what I strongly upheld in my aforementioned dissenting
                     opinion of 28 May 2009 (I.C.J. Reports 2009, p. 192, para. 78), and what
                     successive facts ever since leave as a lesson. When the prerequisites of
                     provisional measures are present — as they in my view already were in
                     May 2009, as confirmed by the successive facts — such measures are to be
                     ordered by the Court, to the benefit of the subjects of rights to be pre-
                     served and protected (such as the right to the realization of justice).
                     Accordingly, in my dissenting opinion I deemed it fit to ponder that :

                             “A decision of the ICJ indicating provisional measures in the pres-
                          ent case, as I herein sustain, would have set up a remarkable precedent
                          in the long search for justice in the theory and practice of international
                          law. After all, this is the first case lodged with the ICJ on the basis of
                          the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture.

                              [T]he prerequisites of urgency and the probability of irreparable
                          harm were and remain in my view present in this case (. . .), requiring
                          from the Court the indication of provisional measures. Moreover,
                          there subsist, at this stage — and without prejudice to the merits of

                           the case — uncertainties which surround the matter at issue before
                           the Court, despite the amendment in February 2007 of the Senegalese
                           Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure.
                             Examples are provided by the prolonged delays apparently due to
                           the alleged high costs of holding the trial of Mr. H. Habré, added to
                           pre‑trial measures still to be taken, and the lack of definition of the
                           time still to be consumed before that trial takes place (if it does at all).
                           Despite all that, as the Court’s majority did not find it necessary to
                           indicate provisional measures, the Court can now only hope for the
                           best.

                               This is all the more serious in the light of the nature of the afore-
                           mentioned obligations of the States parties to the United Nations Con-
                           vention against Torture.

                               This Court should in my view have remained seised of the matter
                           at stake. It should not have relinquished its jurisdiction in the matter
                           of provisional measures, on the ground of its reliance on what may
                           have appeared the professed intentions of the parties, placing itself in
                           a position more akin to that of a conciliator, if not an exspectator.
                           Had the Court done so, it would have assumed the role of the guar-
                           antor of the compliance, in the cas d’espèce, of the conventional obli-
                           gations by the States parties to the UN Convention against Torture
                           in pursuance of the principle aut dedere aut judicare.” (I.C.J. Reports
                           2009, pp. 193‑195, paras. 80, 82‑84 and 88.)
                        81. This point is not to pass unnoticed here. Fortunately — for the
                     sake of the realization of justice in the light of the integrity of the obliga-
                     tions enshrined into the UN Convention against Torture — Mr. H. Habré
                     did not escape from his house surveillance in Dakar, nor was he expelled
                     from Senegal. The acknowledgment of the urgency of the situation was at
                     last made by the ICJ : it underlies its present Judgment on the merits of
                     the case, which it has just adopted today, 20 July 2012, wherein it deter-
                     mined that Senegal has breached Articles 6 (2) and 7 (1) of the UN Con-
                     vention against Torture, and is under the duty to take “without further
                     delay” the necessary measures to submit the case against Mr. H. Habré to
                     its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution (Judgment,
                     para. 121, and resolutory point 6 of the dispositif).

                     justice in the present case becomes even more regrettable if one bears in

                     tion with the absolute prohibition of torture, a prohibition which brings
                     us into the domain of jus cogens. One would have thought that, in face of
                     such an absolute prohibition, the justiciables would hardly face so many
                     obstacles in their search for the realization of justice. This would be so in
                     a world where justice prevailed, which is not ours. The time of human
                     justice is not the time of human beings ; ours is a world where one has to
                     learn soon how to live with the surrounding irrationality, in order per-
                     haps to live a bit longer.


                                  1. The International Legal Regime against Torture
                        83. Yet, despite of the difficulties that have arisen in the cas d’espèce,
                     the truth is that there is today an international legal regime of absolute
                     prohibition of all forms of torture, both physical and psychological, a
                     prohibition which falls under the domain of jus cogens. Such international
                     legal regime has found judicial recognition ; thus, in the case of Can-
                     toral Benavides v. Peru (merits, judgment of 18 August 2000), for ­example,
                     the Inter‑American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) stated
                     that “a true international legal regime has been established of absolute
                     prohibition of all forms of torture” (para. 103).
                        84. Such absolute prohibition of torture finds expression at both nor-
                     mative and jurisprudential levels. The basic principle of humanity, rooted
                     in the human conscience, has arisen and stood against torture. In effect,
                     in our times, the jus cogens prohibition of torture emanates ultimately
                     from the universal juridical conscience, and finds expression in the corpus
                     juris gentium. Torture is thus clearly prohibited, as a grave violation of
                     the international law of human rights and of international humanitarian
                     law, as well as of international criminal law. There is here a normative
                     convergence to this effect ; this is a definitive achievement of civilization,
                     one that admits no regression.

                        85. In the domain of the international law of human rights, the inter-
                     national legal regime of absolute prohibition of torture encompasses the
                     United Nations Convention (of 1984, and its Protocol of 2002) and the
                     Inter‑American (1985) and European (1987) Conventions against Torture,
                     in addition to the Special Rapporteur against Torture (since 1985) of the
                     former UN Human Rights Commission (HRC) and the Working Group
                     on Arbitrary Detention (since 1991) also of the former HRC (which pays
                     special attention to the prevention of torture) 69. The three aforementioned
                     co‑existing Conventions to combat torture are basically complementary
                     ratione materiae 70. Moreover, in the domain of international criminal

                        69 In addition to these mechanisms, there is the United Nations Voluntary Contribu-

                     tions Fund for Victims of Torture (since 1983).

                     law, Article 7 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal
                     Court (ICC) includes the crime of torture within the ICC’s jurisdiction.
                     Torture is in fact prohibited in any circumstances.

                       86. As the IACtHR rightly warned, in its judgments in the case of the
                     Gómez Paquiyauri Brothers v. Peru (of 8 July 2004, paras. 111‑112), as
                     well as of Tibi v. Ecuador (of 7 September 2004, para. 143), and of
                     Baldeón García v. Peru (of 6 April 2006, para. 117),
                             “The prohibition of torture is complete and non‑revocable, even
                           under the most difficult circumstances, such as war, ‘the struggle
                           against terrorism’ and any other crimes, states of siege or of emer-
                           gency, of civil commotion or domestic conflict, suspension of consti-
                           tutional guarantees, domestic political instability, or other public
                           disasters or emergencies.”
                       The IACtHR was quite clear in asserting, for example, in its judgment
                     in the case of Maritza Urrutia v. Guatemala (of 27 November 2003,
                     para. 92), and reiterating in its judgments in the cases of Tibi v. Ecuador
                     (of 7 September 2004, para. 143), of the Brothers Gómez Paquiyauri
                     v. Peru (of 8 July 2004, para. 112), and of Baldeón García v. Peru
                     (of 6 April 2006, para. 117), that
                           “[t]here exists an international legal regime of absolute prohibition of
                           all forms of torture, both physical and psychological, a regime which
                           belongs today to the domain of jus cogens”.
                        87. Likewise, in the case of Caesar v. Trinidad and Tobago (judgment
                     of 11 March 2005), the IACtHR found that the conditions of detention to
                     which the complainant had been subjected (damaging his health — his
                     physical, psychological and moral integrity) amount to an inhuman and
                     degrading treatment, in breach of Article 5 (1) and (2) of the American
                     Convention on Human Rights, which “enshrines precepts of jus cogens”
                     (para. 100). And later on, in the case of Goiburú et al. v. Paraguay (judg-
                     ment of 22 September 2006), the IACtHR reasserted the absolute prohi-
                     bition of torture and enforced disappearance of persons, in the realm of
                     jus cogens, and acknowledged the duty to fight impunity with regard to
                     those grave violations (with the due investigation of the occurrences), so
                     as to honour the memory of the victims and to guarantee the non‑repeti-
                     tion of those facts (para. 93).
                        88. The IACtHR and the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for
                     the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) are the two contemporary international
                     tribunals which have most contributed so far to the jurisprudential con-
                     struction of the absolute prohibition of torture, in the realm of jus
                     cogens 71. For its part, the ICTY, in the same line of reasoning, held, in its
                        71 Cf., recently, A. A. Cançado Trindade, “Jus Cogens : The Determination and the

                     Gradual Expansion of Its Material Content in Contemporary International Case Law”,

                     judgment (Trial Chamber, of 10 December 1998) in the Furundžija case,
                     that torture is “prohibited by a peremptory norm of international law”, it
                     is a prohibition of jus cogens (paras. 153 and 155). Likewise, in its judg-
                     ment (Trial Chamber, of 16 November 1998) in the Delalić et al. case, the
                     ICTY asserted that the prohibition of torture is of conventional and cus-
                     tomary international law, and is a norm of jus cogens (paras. 453‑454).


                        89. This view was reiterated by the ICTY in its judgment (Trial
                     ­ hamber, of 22 February 2001) in the Kunarac case, wherein it stated
                     that
                              “Torture is prohibited under both conventional and customary
                           international law and it is prohibited both in times of peace and
                           ­during an armed conflict. The prohibition can be said to constitute
                            a norm of jus cogens.” (Para. 466.)
                     Other statements of the kind by the ICTY, as to the jus cogens prohibi-
                     tion of torture, are found in its judgment (Appeals Chamber, of 20 Feb-
                     ruary 2001) in the Delalić et al. case (para. 172 and 225), as well as in its
                     judgment (Trial Chamber, of 31 March 2003) in the Naletilić et al. case,
                     wherein it affirmed that
                              “Various judgments of the Tribunal have considered charges of
                           torture as a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, a
                           ­violation of the laws and customs of war and as a crime against
                            humanity. The Celebici trial judgment stated that the prohibition
                            of torture is a norm of customary international law and jus cogens.”
                            (Para. 336.)

                        90. The ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),
                     in turn, contributed to the normative convergence of international human
                     rights law and contemporary international criminal law as to the absolute
                     prohibition of torture, in interpreting, in its decision (Chamber I)
                     of 2 September 1998 in the case of J.‑P. Akayesu, the term “torture” as
                     set forth in Article 3 (f) of its Statute, in accordance with the definition
                     of torture set forth in Article 1 (1) of the UN Convention against Torture,
                     namely,
                           “any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or men-
                           tal, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtain-
                           ing from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing
                           him for an act that he or a third person has committed or is suspected
                           of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third per-
                           son, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such
                           pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the
                           consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in
                           an official capacity” (para. 681).

                        91. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), for its part, has
                     also pronounced on the matter at issue, to the same effect. Thus, in its
                     judgment (Grand Chamber) of 12 November 2008, on the Demir and
                     Baykara v. Turkey case, it held that the prohibition of torture has “attained
                     the status of a peremptory norm of international law, or jus cogens”, and
                     added that this finding was “incorporated into its case law in this sphere”
                     (para. 73). In a broader context, of prohibition of inhuman and degrading
                     treatment (encompassing mental suffering), the reasoning developed by
                     the ECHR in its judgment of 2 March 2010, in the Al‑Saadoon and
                     ­Mufdhi v. United Kingdom case, leaves room to infer an acknowledgment
                      of a normative hierarchy in international law, giving pride of place to
                      the norms that safeguard the dignity of the human person.

                        92. The aforementioned development conducive to the current abso-
                     lute (jus cogens) prohibition of torture has taken place with the aware-
                     ness of the horror and the inhumanity of the practice of torture.
                     Testimonies of victims of torture — as in the proceedings of contempo-
                     rary international human rights tribunals — give account of that. Even
                     before the present era, some historical testimonies did the same. One such
                     testimony — a penetrating one — is that of Jean Améry, himself a victim
                     of torture. In his own words,

                           “(. . .) torture is the most horrible event a human being can retain
                           within himself. (. . .) Whoever was tortured, stays tortured. Torture
                           is ineradicably burned into him, even when no clinically objective
                           traces can be detected. (. . .) The person who has survived torture and
                           whose pains are starting to subside (. . .) experiences an ephemeral
                           peace that is conducive to thinking. (. . .) If from the experience of
                           torture any knowledge at all remains that goes beyond the plain night-
                           marish, it is that of a great amazement and a foreignness in the world
                           that cannot be compensated by any sort of subsequent human com-
                           munication. (. . .) Whoever has succumbed to torture can no longer
                           feel at home in the world. (. . .) The shame of destruction cannot be
                           erased. Trust in the world, which already collapsed in part at the first
                           blow, but in the end, under torture, fully will not be regained. (. . .)
                           One who was martyred is a defenseless prisoner of fear. It is fear that
                           henceforth reigns over him. Fear — and also what is called resent-
                           ment. They remain (. . .).” 72

                     to the consolidation of the international legal regime against torture. To
                     this effect, the Court significantly states that
                               “In the Court’s opinion, the prohibition of torture is part of cus-
                           tomary international law and it has become a peremptory norm (jus
                           cogens).
                               That prohibition is grounded in a widespread international prac-
                           tice and on the opinio juris of States. It appears in numerous inter-
                           national instruments of universal application (in particular the

                            into the domestic law of almost all States ; finally, acts of torture
                            are regularly denounced within national and international fora.”
                            (­Judgment, para. 99.)
                        94. One of the features of the present‑day international legal regime
                      against torture is the establishment of a mechanism of continuous moni-
                     toring of a preventive character. This is illustrated by the 2002 Optional
                     Protocol of the 1984 UN Convention against Torture, as well as the pre-
                     ventive inspections under the 1987 European Convention for the Preven-
                     tion of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
                     (Art. 2). In this regard, I deemed it fit to point out, in my concurring
                     opinion in the case of Maritza Urrutia v. Guatemala (IACtHR,
                     ­judgment of 27 November 2003), that such development has

                           “put an end to one of the remaining strongholds of State sovereignty,
                           in permitting scrutiny of the sancta sanctorum of the State — its
                           prisons and detention establishments, police stations, military
                           ­
                           prisons, detention centers for foreigners, psychiatric institutions,

                           among others, — of its administrative practices and legislative
                           ­measures, to determine their compatibility or not with the internatio­
                            nal standards of human rights. This has been achieved in the name
                            of superior common values, consubstantiated in the prevalence of
                            the fundamental rights inherent to the human person.” (Para. 11.)

                     putting an end to the scourges of arbitrary detention and torture. The
                     general principles of the law, and the fundamental human values underly-

                     ing them, play a quite significant and crucial role here. Such fundamental
                     values have counted on judicial recognition in our times. Thus, the ECHR,
                     for example, asserted, in the Soering v. United Kingdom case (judgment
                     of 7 July 1989), that the absolute prohibition of torture (even in times of
                     war and other national emergencies) expresses one of the “fundamental
                     values of [contemporary] democratic societies” (para. 88). Subsequently,
                     in the Kalashnikov v. Russia case (judgment of 15 July 2002), the ECHR
                     stated that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights
                           “enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society.
                           It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treat-
                           ment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the vic-
                           tim’s behaviour.” (Para. 95.)
                      96. In the Selmouni v. France case (judgment of 28 July 1999), the
                     ECHR categorically reiterated that Article 3 of the European Convention
                           “enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic societies.
                           Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against ter-
                           rorism and organized crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms
                           torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike
                           most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols
                           Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no dero­
                           gation from it is permissible under Article 15 (2) even in the event of a
                           public emergency threatening the life of the nation (. . .).” (Para. 95.)
                       In that same judgment, the European Court expressed its understand-
                     ing that “the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the
                     protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly
                     and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fun-
                     damental values of democratic societies” (para. 101) 73.
                       97. Like the ECHR, the IACtHR also singled out the fundamental
                     human values underlying the absolute prohibition of torture. Thus, in the
                     case of Cantoral Benavides v. Peru (merits, judgment of 18 August 2000),
                     pondered that certain acts which were formerly classified as inhuman or
                     degrading treatment should from now on be classified distinctly, as tor-
                     ture, given the “growing demands” for the protection of fundamental
                     human rights (para. 99). This, in the understanding of the IACtHR,
                     required a more vigorous response in facing “infractions to the basic val-
                     ues of democratic societies” (para. 99). In the Cantoral Benavides case, the
                     IACtHR, with its reasoning, thus purported to address the consequences
                     of the absolute prohibition of torture.


                         73 In the cas d’espèce, the ECHR found the respondent State responsible for the torture

                     inflicted on Selmouni (paras. 105‑106). A similar line of reasoning can be found, e.g., in the
                     judgment (of 7 September 2004) of the IACtHR in the case of Tibi v. Ecuador (para. 143),
                     wherein it likewise found the respondent State responsible for the torture inflicted on the
                     victim (para. 165).

                        98. In effect, the practice of torture, in all its perversion, is not limited
                     to the physical injuries inflicted on the victim ; it seeks to annihilate the
                     victim’s identity and integrity. It causes chronic psychological distur-
                     bances that continue indefinitely, making the victim unable to continue
                     living normally as before. Expert opinions rendered before international
                     tribunals consistently indicate that torture aggravates the victim’s vulner-
                     ability, causing nightmares, loss of trust in others, hypertension, and
                     depression ; a person tortured in prison or detention loses the spatial
                     dimension and even that of time itself 74.
                        99. As to the devastating consequences of the (prohibited) practice of
                     torture, and the irreparable damage caused by it, I pondered, in my sepa-
                     rate opinion in the case Tibi v. Ecuador (IACtHR, judgment of 7 Septem-
                     ber 2004), that
                           “[f]urthermore, the practice of torture (whether to obtain a confession
                           or information or to cause social fear) generates a disintegrating emo-
                           tional burden that is transmitted to the next of kin of the victim, who
                           in turn project it toward the persons they live with. The widespread
                           practice of torture, even though it takes place within jails, ultimately
                           contaminates all the social fabric. The practice of torture has sequels
                           not only for its victims, but also for broad sectors of the social milieu
                           affected by it. Torture generates psychosocial damage and, under cer-
                           tain circumstances, it can lead to actual social breakdown. (. . .)

                              The practice of torture is a hellish threat to civilization itself. One
                           of the infallible criteria of civilization is precisely the treatment given
                           by public authorities of any country to detainees or incarcerated per-
                           sons. F. M. Dostoyevsky warned about this in his aforementioned
                           Memoirs from the House of the Dead (1862) ; for him, the degree of
                           civilization attained by any social milieu can be assessed by entering
                           its jails and detention centers 75. Torture is an especially grave viola-
                           tion of human rights because, in its various forms, its ultimate objec-
                           tive is to annul the very identity and personality of the victim,
                           undermining his or her physical or mental resistance ; thus, it treats
                           the victim as a ‘mere means’ (in general to obtain a confession), fla-
                           grantly violating the basic principle of the dignity of the human per-
                           son (which expresses the Kantian concept of the human being as an
                           ‘end in himself’), degrading him, in a perverse and cruel manner 76,
                           and causing him truly irreparable damage.” (Paras. 22 and 24.)
