                      conduct — Determination of “global sums” by reference to equitable considerations

                      affected communities and individuals more difficult — Collective reparations

                                                I. Introductory Remarks

                         1. I have voted with reluctance in favour of the dispositif of this Judg-
                      ment. The overall amount of compensation awarded by the Court seems
                      reasonable, given the circumstances that have characterized these pro-
                      ceedings. I do not, however, agree with the reasoning that led to this deci-
                      sion or, with regard to certain aspects, the lack of appropriate analysis or
                      explanation; and the radical reversal of the burden of proof which requires
                      the Republic of Uganda (“Uganda”) to prove a double negative fact with
                      respect to injuries that occurred in Ituri. I also disagree with the manner
                      in which the various components of the award were determined; and the
                      designation of the State of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
                      (“DRC”) as the sole beneficiary of compensation, thus paying little or no
                      attention to the rights of communities and individuals to reparation for
                      harm suffered as a result of gross violations of human rights and interna-
                      tional humanitarian law by Uganda during the armed conflict.

                                             II. Evidence and Burden of Proof

                        3. In its 2005 Judgment, the Court stated that, failing agreement
                      between the Parties,
                              “The DRC would thus be given the opportunity to demonstrate and
                            prove the exact injury that was suffered as a result of specific actions
                            of Uganda constituting internationally wrongful acts for which it is
                            responsible. It goes without saying, however, as the Court has had the
                            opportunity to state in the past, ‘that in the phase of the proceedings
                            devoted to reparation, neither Party may call in question such findings
                            in the present Judgment as have become res judicata’” 1 (emphasis
                            added).
                      This standard is consistent with the express acknowledgement made by
                      the DRC in the oral hearings at the time that “for the purposes of deter-
                      mining the extent of reparation it must specify the nature of the injury
                      and establish the causal link with the initial wrongful act” 2.
                         4. The Court had given ample opportunity to the Applicant to demon-
                      strate and prove the injury that was suffered as a result of the wrongful
                      actions of Uganda for which it was found responsible in 2005. The Parties
                      had more than ten years to resolve the issue of reparation through nego-
                      tiations, during which they could have collected evidence and information
                      to assist their negotiations, or for the purposes of litigation if these nego-
                      tiations were to fail. After the filing of the Parties’ pleadings, the Court
                      also availed itself of its powers, under Article 62, paragraph 1, of its
                      Rules, to elicit further information from the Parties, requesting additional
                      information, evidence and explanations with respect to the various heads
                      of damages and the methodologies proposed by the Parties.
                         5. As noted in various parts of the Judgment, the DRC has failed to
                      furnish appropriate evidence with respect to the injuries suffered and “the

                      (“The [DRC] does not deny that, for purposes of determining the extent of the repara-
                      tion, it must specify the nature of the injury and establish the causal link with the initial
                      wrongful act.”).

                      evidence included in the case file by the DRC is, for the most part, insuf-
                      ficient to reach a precise determination of the amount of compensation
                      due” (para. 125). Faced with this situation, the Court had to take into
                      account other sources of evidence, such as the reports of the United
                      Nations, and those of other intergovernmental organizations and govern-
                      mental commissions, including the Porter Judicial Commission of Inquiry
                      established by Uganda. It also took into consideration the reports of the
                      Court-­appointed experts where it considered them relevant. This is all
                      well and good. The Court could not have done otherwise under the pres-
                      ent circumstances in order to fulfil its judicial function.
                         6. However, with regard to the injuries that occurred in Ituri, the Judg-
                      ment’s reasoning is predicated on a radical reversal of the burden of proof
                      upon the Respondent. According to paragraph 78,
                            “it is for Uganda to establish, in this phase of the proceedings, that a
                            particular injury alleged by the DRC in Ituri was not caused by Ugan-
                            da’s failure to meet its obligations as an occupying Power. In the
                            absence of evidence to that effect, it may be concluded that Uganda
                            owes reparation in relation to such injury.”
                         7. The same standard of proof is expressed at various points through-
                      out the Judgment, concerning the causal nexus between the internation-
                      ally wrongful acts and the injury suffered (para. 95), the burden and
                      standard of proof (para. 118), the determination of the extent of the loss
                      of life and other damage to persons in Ituri (paras. 149, 155, 161 and 226)
                      as well as damage to property and public infrastructure in Ituri (paras. 241
                      and 257).
                         8. In essence, the Judgment requires Uganda to prove a double nega-
                      tive fact, namely that every “particular injury” in Ituri that is alleged by
                      the DRC was “not caused” by its “failure” as the occupying Power. If
                      Uganda fails to do so, the Court will make inferences both that the injury
                      alleged by the DRC has occurred, and that this particular injury was
                      causally linked to Uganda’s “failure” to comply with its obligations in
                      Ituri. Such a strict standard places upon Uganda the task of identifying
                      all instances of alleged injury that occurred in Ituri after so many years
                      (even if Uganda is no longer in effective control of that territory); tracing
                      the original cause of that injury to the responsible actor (whether within
                      its sphere of control at the time, or not), and demonstrating the absence
                      of a causal nexus between that damage and its own conduct. Thus, so
                      long as the Applicant makes a prima facie allegation with respect to a
                      “particular injury” in Ituri, the entire burden of proof is placed on the
                      shoulders of the Respondent to disprove these allegations and, in the
                      absence of evidence, an injury causally linked to Uganda’s failures is pre-
                      sumed to have been proven.
                         9. It is to be noted, however, that even though the standard is repeat-
                      edly articulated in several paragraphs of the Judgment as mentioned
                      above, it is not analysed anywhere in the Judgment with respect to the
                      various heads of damage such as loss of life, personal injuries, property

                      loss or natural resources. The Judgment mentions very briefly in two con-
                      cluding paragraphs (paras. 161 and 226) that Uganda did not produce
                      evidence to establish that “particular injuries” alleged by the DRC were
                      “not caused” by its “failures” without any analysis of the evidence
                      Uganda was expected to produce in accordance with this standard. This
                      raises the question as to the purpose of the repeated assertion of this stan-
                      dard in the Judgment if it was not going to be applied to the facts of the
                      case and to the evidence expected from Uganda.

                         10. In an effort to justify this unprecedented and exceptional eviden-
                      tiary burden placed on Uganda, references are made in the Judgment to
                      the Corfu Channel and the Diallo cases. However, none of the Judgments
                      in those cases provides support to such a radical reversal of the burden of
                      proof. Paragraphs 120 and 157 of the Judgment refer to the Judgment in
                      the Corfu Channel case in support of the proposition that the Court may
                      have “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evi-
                      dence” in cases where a State that “would normally bear the burden of
                      proof has lost effective control over the territory where crucial evidence is
                      located on account of the belligerent occupation of its territory by another
                      State” 3. This is quite true, but the standard of proof applied in the pres-
                      ent Judgment differs from the principles enunciated in Corfu Channel
                      with respect to the allocation of the burden of proof. In the latter case,
                      the Court stated that, when the victim of a breach of international law is
                      unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility due to
                      the exclusive territorial control exercised by another State within its fron-
                      tiers (as is the case here, with respect to the wrongful occupation of Ituri),
                      the Court may resort to “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and
                      circumstantial evidence” as indirect evidence that an injurious event has
                      occurred within that territory.

                        11. The Court, however, was clear that such reasonable inferences did
                      not involve a reversal of the burden of proof of the kind contemplated in
                      paragraph 78 of the Judgment:
                               “It is true, as international practice shows, that a State on whose
                            territory or in whose waters an act contrary to international law has
                            occurred, may be called upon to give an explanation. It is also true
                            that that State cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply
                            that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors.
                            The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars
                            of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its
                            disposal. But it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control
                            exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State neces-
                            sarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated

                      that an unspecified injury was “not caused” by “its failure”). A more rea-
                      sonable application of the principle enunciated in Diallo would have been
                      to require Uganda to establish positive facts lying within its sphere of con-
                      trol, namely that it took adequate and effective measures to prevent in
                      Ituri the injuries alleged by the Applicant, in line with its duty of vigilance.
                         16. The radical reversal of the burden of proof is also inconsistent with
                      the nature of the duty of vigilance incumbent upon the occupying Power
                      as an obligation of due diligence, rather than an obligation of result. The
                      nature of the primary obligation that has been breached is of key import
                      to the allocation of the burden of proof. As stated in Diallo, and subse-
                      quently reaffirmed in Croatia v. Serbia with regard to alleged genocidal
                      acts, “[t]he determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on
                      the subject-­matter and the nature of each dispute brought before the Court;
                      it varies according to the type of facts which it is necessary to establish for
                      the purposes of the decision of the case” 11.
                         17. It follows that when the Court decides how to allocate the burden
                      of proof between the parties, it must pay close attention to the nature of
                      the primary obligation that has been breached and the circumstances of
                      each case. In the present case, the Court found that Uganda was respon-
                      sible in Ituri for the violation of Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of
                      1907, which reads as follows:
                               “The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into
                            the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his
                            power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and
                            safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force
                            in the country.” 12
                        18. Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 imposes a duty of
                      vigilance upon the occupying Power to ensure respect for public order
                      and safety in the occupied territory both by its own forces and private
                      parties 13. As the Court stated in 2005, Uganda was under an obligation
                      under that provision

                      was not responsible for every kind of injury or damage that might have
                      occurred in Ituri at all times and places during its occupation, but only
                      for those damages and injuries that could have been averted, had Uganda
                      taken adequate and effective measures of diligence — the existence of
                      which should normally be within Uganda’s ability to prove to the Court.

                            erty, and for preventing pillage. Consequently, Ethiopia is liable for permitting the

                            pation.”

                         20. It follows, in my view, that the shifting of the evidentiary burden
                      for the purposes of quantification of damage cannot go beyond what was
                      required by Uganda under the primary rule. As noted in the Commentary
                      to Article 36 of the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Articles on
                      Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the principles
                      to be applied in the quantification of damages “will vary, depending upon
                      the content of particular primary obligations” 17. When determining the
                      allocation of the burden of proof, Uganda may only be required to prove
                      what was required of it by Article 43 of the Hague Regulations, i.e. that
                      it took “all the measures in [its] power to restore, and ensure, as far as
                      possible, public order and safety”. The Court cannot expect Uganda to
                      disprove each and every injury in Ituri alleged by the DRC, or prove that
                      such injury was “not caused” by its “failures”. To do so is to extend
                      ex post facto the scope of Uganda’s primary obligations under the law of
                      occupation through the mechanism of responsibility.


                        21. In light of the foregoing, I am of the view that a more balanced
                      outcome could have been achieved through a nuanced allocation of the
                      burden of proof, which would be more in tune with the content of the
                      primary obligation in question that has been breached. In accordance
                      with the onus probandi rule, it should fall upon the DRC to establish the
                      extent of the injuries suffered in Ituri, as the Court held with respect to
                      other regions of the DRC’s territory and in paragraph 260 of the
                      2005 Judgment. In line with Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of 1907,
                      Uganda would bear the onus to prove that it took measures in compli-
                      ance with its duty of vigilance, or that the injury would have occurred
                      even if Uganda had taken adequate and effective measures. The burden
                      would then shift to the DRC to disprove Uganda’s contentions. This
                      would be without prejudice to the rule that the distribution of the burden
                      of proof “does not relieve the other party of its duty to co‑operate ‘in
                      the provision of such evidence as may be in its possession that could assist
                      the Court in resolving the dispute submitted to it’” 18. In line with
                      the Corfu Channel principle, the Court would then be at liberty to draw
                      reasonable inferences from the Parties’ submissions. It is regrettable that
                      the Court has not opted for this approach in the present circumstances.
