I regret that I am not able to associate myself with the Judgment
of the Court. The reasons which have led me to differ from the
conclusion at which the Court has arrived should I think be stated.

The present proceedings are burdened with a great volume of
evidence, a considerable amount of which is quite irrelevant.

The task is to sift the wheat from the chaff.

The case, in my view, is peculiarly one in which a conclusion may
safely be reached only by a detailed examination of the evidence
and a strict application thereto of the relevant principles of inter-
national law.

My own examination has led me to the conclusion that Cambodia
has failed to make out any claim for relief.

Article 40 of the Statute of the Court provides that the Appli-
cation to the Court shall state the subject of the dispute. Article ;2
(2) of the Rules of Court provides that it must also, as far as possible,
state the precise nature of the claim and give an accurate statement
of the facts and grounds on which the claim is based.

The subject of the dispute in this case is the Temple of Preah
Vihear (in Siamese called Phra Viharn) over which the Kingdom of
Cambodia claims sovereignty. Its claim as stated in the Application
is based upon the terms of international conventions delimiting the
frontier between it and Thailand.

The convention which the Application states is fundamental to
the present dispute is the Treaty of 1904. This Treaty, supplemented
- by a protocol dated 29 June 1904, relates to a long line of frontier
between Thailand and Indo-China. Article 1 thereof which dealt
with a part of this frontier line stated, ¢nter alia, that on the moun-
tain chain of the Dangrek—on which the Temple happens to be
situate—the frontier line should follow the line of the watershed
until it reached a mountain range known as Pnom Padang, the
crest of which it should follow towards the east as far as the river
Mekong. Article 3 stipulated that the delimitation of “‘the frontier

Cambodia’s contention, as stated in the Application and Memo-
rial, is that the work of delimitation was carried out from 1904
to 1907 and that, so far as concerns the delimitation of the frontier
on the chain of the Dangrek, “the final frontier line was adopted
by the Delimitation Commission during the year 1907” in the form
of a map or map sheet known in this case as Annex I. On that
Annex the area where the Temple is situated is shown as within
Cambodia. This “frontier line” is stated in the Application as
having been “formally approved” by a Protocol to the Treaty
of 1907.

As will subsequently appear this last statement had no foundation.
The statement was a complete misapprehension of the true position,
first on the part of France, and later by Cambodia, and throws
considerable light upon these proceedings and upon the reasons why
Cambodia ultimately became obliged to move away from her case
as formulated in her Application and resort to other and new
grounds upon which to seek a basis for her claim for relief. There
was no approval of the frontier line on any part of the Dangrek by
the Protocol of 1907. The reference to what had been “formally
approved” related to a decision of the Mixed Commission recorded
at a meeting of 18 January 1907 when a point on the eastern ex-
tremity of the northern frontier between Indo-China and Siam, of
which frontier the Dangrek formed the western sector, was deter-
mined.

In the course of the oral proceedings Cambodia has endeavoured
to extend her claim as stated in the Application and Memorial and
the grounds on which it rests. But the principal ground on which it
relies remains that stated, namely, that Annex I represents the
delimitation of the Dangrek frontier by the Mixed Commission
under the Treaty of 1904.

In its Application and Memorial the Kingdom of Cambodia asked
the Court to declare that the territorial sovereignty over the Temple
belongs to it. In neither did it describe the actual Temple area over
which it claims sovereignty nor has it since done so. It is however
inherent in its Application and Memorial that its claim of sover-
eignty over the Temple is based upon the proposition that Annex I
was a delimitation of the Dangrek frontier by the Mixed Commission
established under the Treaty of 1904—and solely by that Commis-
sion. Sovereignty over the whole area shown on Annex 1 as south
of the frontier line was, it claims, accordingly vested in it. This

I shall first address myself to the principal ground on which
Cambodia bases her claim to relief, the only ground indeed which
Cambodia, in accordance with her Application, came to the Court
to litigate.

The juridical foundation for the claim of Cambodia is to be found
in Articles 1 and 3 of the Treaty of 1904. The legal system by
virtue of which the frontier was to be delimited is set forth in
Article 3 and nowhere else. It was for the Mixed Commission to
be created under Article 3, and solely for that body, to make the
delimitation.

The Temple finds no mention in the Treaty. Before a decision

The frontier was defined in Article 1 of the Treaty. What was
to constitute a sufficient delimitation of that frontier was for the
Mixed Commission to decide. It could, if it so wished in respect of
any part of the frontier, delimit it by a reference in terms to the
text of the Treatv and Protocol. That was a matter entirely for
itself to decide.

Whatever the delimitation made, however, it was not a delimi-
tation at large, it was controlled by Article 1 of the Treaty which
“determined” the frontier !. Subjecc to whatever power of adaption
the Mixed Commission may inherently have possessed, the delim-
itation had to be established on the basis of the criterion laid
down in Article 1 which on the Dangrek was the line of the water-
shed and only on the basis of this criterion. If it was not on the
basis of this criterion, any purported delimitation would lack any
legal force.

The Minutes of the meeting of the Mixed Commission from the
date of its first meeting on 3 January 1905 to that of 18 January
1907, which was to prove its last, were placed before the Court by
Thailand.

In the course of oral argument it was faintly suggested by Cam-

bodia that perhaps one or more Minutes might be missing, or
perhaps all decisions taken by the Mixed Commission had not been
recorded, or perhaps in particular a decision as to which State
sovereignty in the Temple should be attributed was not noted.

There is no foundation for these suggestions. For quite apart
from the internal evidence which the Minutes themselves provide
there is other documentary evidence which establishes beyond
reasonable controversy that the Minutes produced are a complete
record of the deliberations and the decisions of the Mixed Com-
mission. A report by Colonel Bernard, the President of the French
Commission of Delimitation, of 14 April 1908 to the French Minister
of the Colonies in which he forwarded an original copy of the
Minutes indicating the number forwarded, establishes this. It is
utterly unlikely that any decision of delimitation failed to be rec-
orded in these Minutes.

The Minutes were the work of French and Siamese secretaries
appointed by the Mixed Commission at its first meeting, who were
“responsible for drawing up the minutes”. The practice was for
them to be drawn up by the French and submitted to the Siamese
for approval and thereafter to be signed respectively by the Presi-
dent of each Commission. The Minutes were manifestly prepared
with considerable care and in great detail. No record is to be found
within them to support in any way the contention of Cambodia
that a frontier line corresponding to Annex I or indeed a frontier
line on the Dangrek shown on any map or sketch was at any time
either discussed or decided upon by the Mixed Commission. Nor is
there any reference at all to the Temple of Preah Vihear which
indeed does not appear to have acquired any real importance for
either State until many years later.

The matter of the frontier on the Dangrek was referred to at the
first meeting of the Mixed Commission early in 1905. It was decided
that the work of delimitation of the frontier from the Great Lake
to the Dangrek and thence easterly to the Mekong should be post-
poned until a later season.

Nothing directed to this end was undertaken until December of
1906. It was not till then that the frontier line defined in Article 1
of the Treaty of 1904 received any direct consideration.

At a meeting of the Mixed Commission held on the 2nd of that
month it was agreed to make a reconnaissance from the Great Lake
to the Dangrek and thence easterly to the river Mekong to the
point at which the crest of the mountain range known as the
Pnom Padang met that river. This reconnaissance was in fact made
and was completed by 10 January 1907, and so far as the Dangrek
mountain range is concerned, apparently before the 3rd of that
month, since at that date the Mixed Commission was at Ban Mek
near the Mekong.



The labours of the Mixed Commission had until December 1906
been directed to the region of Luang Prabang?!, which was far to
the north of and beyond the Kingdom of Cambodia, and to the
region, within the Kingdom, between the Great Lake and the sea
to the south.

In December 1906, when the labours of the Mixed Commission
were directed to the frontier defined in Article 1 of the Treaty which
was north of the Great Lake, Colonel Bernard had already other
ideas as to where the western frontier line south of the Dangrek
should be, ideas which were not in conformity with the frontier
stipulated in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1904.

He was opposed to any part of the frontier being determined by
a parallel and a meridian as laid down in that Article. It is evident
from the Minutes of the Mixed Commission that he was determined,
if he could, to prevent this taking place. His constant view made
known at the first meeting of the Mixed Commission was that “it
was absolutely essential that there should, above all, be a frontier
that was visible and known to everyone”. The frontier as stipulated
in Article 1 of the Treaty north of the Great Lake, notwithstanding
the clear terms of that Article, was inadmissible 2

At the first meeting of the Mixed Commission in January 1905
he had lost no time in making his views known. The record of the
Minutes of that meeting reads as follows:

“Commandant Bernard said that the task which their respective
Governments had entrusted to the Commission was that of de-
termining the frontier by following in its main lines the Treaty
concluded between France on 13 February 1904... Thus as far as
that frontier was concerned to the north of the Great Lake, it was
stipulated that the frontier should start from the mouth of the river
Stung Roluos and should follow the parallel from that point east-
wards until it met the river Kompong Tiam; then turning north-
wards, it was to lie along the meridian from that meeting point to
the mountain chain of the Pnom Dangrek.

Such a frontier was inadmissible between two civilized nations
such as France and Siam...

He never departed from this view. As late as the last meeting
held by the Mixed Commission on 18 January 1907 he stated that:

“When accurate maps were available [italics added] a new frontier
defined by topographical features should be sought.”

Unable, as the Minutes reveal, to persuade the leader of the
Siamese Commission to agree with his views on a new frontier line
to the north of the Great Lake—the latter who throughout the
work of the Mixed Commission endeavoured as a general rule to

adhere to the Treaty line, having made it clear that he was not
empowered to discuss “any frontier different from that of the Treaty”
[italics added]—Colonel Bernard conceded it was in those circum-
stances necessary for the Mixed Commission to define strictly the
parallel and meridian indicated in the Treaty. In so doing, he stated,

The record reveals that at this point of time Colonel Bernard,
and since October of the preceding year, had in mind plans to
extend the frontiers of France a considerable distance to the west
of those provided in the Treaty of 1904 and was concentrating his
efforts to carry them into effect.

This finally he succeeded in accomplishing through the Treaty
of 23 March 1907.

*

The leader of the Siamese Commission having been insistent upon
following the Treaty line, the two Commissions on 5 December
1906, by compromise, agreed upon a point which should be deemed
to be the mouth of the river Stung Roluos within the meaning of
Article 1 of the Treaty of 1904, and on 3 January 1907, again by
compromise, agreed upon a point which should be deemed to be
where the parallel from the former point met the river Prec Kom-
pong Tiam within the meaning of the said Article.

Until these two points could be agreed upon it was not possible
either to fix the frontier line from the Great Lake north to the
Dangrek, or the commencing point on the frontier of the Dangrek
whence it ran in an easterly direction to the Mekong.

Only one further meeting of the Mixed Commission was in fact
to be held, namely, on 18 January 1907.

At its meeting of 2 December 1906, when the Mixed Commission’s
reconnaissance of the Dangrek and easterly to the Mekong was
agreed to be made, it had been decided that a Captain Oum—an
officer in the French military forces— “would survey the whole
region of the Dangrek” whilst other French officers would carry out
the survey measurements. A Captain Kerler with another French
officer was to start work from the Great Lake working north to
join up with the Dangrek where it was met by the meridian. The
survey work was done exclusively by French officers, as was almost
universally the case throughout the whole of the frontier regions.
Captain Oum and Captain Kerler are those officers whose work on
the spot is noted on the left-hand top corner of Annex I. The
topographical surveys could not in any manner constitute delimi-
tations. It is common ground between the Parties that the topo-
graphical and survey officers were vested with no discretion and
had no power to delimit or discuss any question of delimitation of



any part of the frontier. Their duties were strictly technical.

From as early as October 1906 Colonel Bernard had been agitating
his superiors to enter into negotiations with the Siamese Govern-
ment with a view to acquiring “all the old Cambodian provinces”.
If this could be accomplished it would result in carrying the western
boundaries of Indo-China a considerable distance to the west. In
that same month he was successful in obtaining official approval
of his proposals. From that moment on his activities were mainly
directed to this end. It is evident he was anxious to accomplish his
purpose as soon as he could and then to wind up the Mixed Com-
mission.

In the first week of March, on the arrival in Bangkok of Mr.
Strobel, the adviser to the Siamese Government, his activities in-
creased in their intensity.

On his journey through Paris Mr. Strobel had been informed of
difficulties on the frontier north of the Great Lake. From the
moment of Mr. Strobel’s arrival events moved rapidly. They throw
an interesting light upon the circumstances in which the work of
the Mixed Commission came to an end.



The French topographical officers arrived in Bangkok at different
times between 18 February and 4 March. They had by this latter
date just completed their work in the field. Provisional maps of the
frontier region were not completed æ##/ 5 March, and no final maps
were in existence. A meeting of the Mixed Commission was pro-
visionally called for 8 March by Colonel Bernard.

On this day however the first steps were taken by Colonel Bernard
in discussions with Mr. Strobel to negotiate a new boundary treaty
with Siam. The meeting of the Mixed Commission called for the
same day was “postponed indefinitely”.

Colonel Bernard’s conversations with Mr. Strobel continued for
six days.

At this point of time His Majesty the King of Siam was about
to depart on a visit to France. Mr. Strobel sought to postpone
solution of the question of absorption of the “old Cambodian
provinces” until the King’s return. Colonel Bernard was insistent
upon it being settled before the King’s departure.

Finally he persuaded Mr. Strobel to his point of view. He was,
as the record abundantly reveals, an efficient officer and a domi-
nating personality.

From that moment events moved rapidly.

A draft treaty was first drawn up on 14 March. It was signed
on 23 March. Colonel Bernard left Bangkok on the 26th and on
5 April he sailed from Saigon for France where he remained.

No further meeting of the Mixed Commission was held. It
dispersed and ceased to exist.

Annex I was one of eleven map sheets of the whole frontier
regions covered by the Treaty and Protocol of 1904. Whatever
survey sketches may have existed previously, these map sheets did
not come into being until November of 1907. This is therefore a
critical date since at that point of time the Mixed Commission no

1 Lecture delivered by Colonel Bernard to the Société de Géographie, 20 Decem-
ber 1907.



longer existed. Since the Mixed Commission never met after
18 January 1907 and the topographical officers did not complete their
work until at least a month later, it is evident that no report from
Captain Oum and no sketch or working map in relation to the
Dangrek frontier region of any description could ever have been
placed before the Mixed Commission for discussion or decision.
None ever was.

In the face of the facts stated—all of which are established beyond
controversy—it is an unproductive exercise to have recourse to
presumptions or inferences from the subsequent conduct of the
Parties in an effort to establish that the Mixed Commission must
in fact have made a decision delimiting the Dangrek by agreeing
to the frontier line shown in or in the form of Annex I or in the
form of any sketch or map.

No presumption can be made and no inference can be drawn
which 1s inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the
evidence.

Independently of the facts stated it would seem a little unlikely
to say the least that, when the Treaty and Protocol of 1907 was
drafted, if there had been any map or sketch agreed to by the
Mixed Commission which delineated the frontier line on any part
of the Dangrek or the Pnom Padang east to the river Mekong that
no reference whatever to such a map or sketch would have been
made in the text of that Treaty.

Article I of the Protocol to the Treaty of 1907 described the new
frontier between Indo-China and Siam. Included within the de-
scription was the frontier which extended along the Dangrek—
from a point considerably west of the 1904 Treaty line—and ran

There was indeed in Article I of the Protocol of 1907 a reference
to a sketch of the frontier, but this sketch did not cover the region
of the Dangrek shown in Annex I. There was also a reference therein
to a line (tracé) adopted by the Mixed Commission. This however
related to the eastern extremity of the frontier above mentioned,
and to a decision taken by the Mixed Commission at its last
meeting on 18 January 1907 and recorded in the Minutes of that
date to the effect that the thalweg of a certain river—the Huei
Don—should be the agreed point at which the crest of the Pnom
Padang met the river Mekong within the meaning of Article 1 of
the Treaty of 1904.

Colonel Bernard played the principal role in the drafting of the
Treaty and Protocol of 1907 particularly, I would think, in the
technical description of the frontier. If an inference may be drawn
it would seem permissible to assume, certainly all the probabilities
would suggest, that at the date of that Treaty and Protocol, namely
23 March 1907, if there had been any map or sketch which up to
that point of time had been agreed to by the Mixed Commission as
delimiting any part of the frontiers from the Kel Pass on the
Dangrek along the Pnom Padang to the east, it would at least have
warranted some reference. The fact that there is no mention of
any such decision is in the circumstances powerful, indeed; I think,
overwhelming evidence that no such delimitation had been made.

in the region of the Temple, that it should be mentioned neither in
the Minutes nor in the Treaty and Protocol of 1907 nor in any
contemporaneous document.

The reference in Article I of the Protocol of 1907 to a sketch and
‘‘tracé” immediately following the description of the frontier line on
the Dangrek and Pnom Padang is, I think, of no little importance in
this case. It has a distinct bearing upon the manner in which Cam-
bodia has presented her case and why quite late in the proceedings
she shifted from the ground on which she relied in her Application
and added grounds which were neither set forth nor foreshadowed
therein.

When the meeting of the Mixed Commission of 18 January 1907
had concluded, Colonel Bernard believed that the work of the Mixed
Commission, at least in the field, had been completed. He said so
in so many words in a telegram of the 28/29 January 1907.


III JUDGM. I5 VI 62 (DISS. OP. SIR PERCY SPENDER)

If there were any decision of the Mixed Commission made by it
during its reconnaissance of the Dangrek which, for some quite
unknown reason, was not in any manner referred to in either the
Minutes of 3 January or 18 January—or indeed on the next day
when they met again together—it is manifest that it could not
have been in the form of any line appearing on any sketch or map
since, not only was there not then even a topographical sketch map
of the frontier region in existence, but the topographical survey
work, without which no line of the watershed of any description
was capable of being drawn up and decided upon, was unfinished.
Captain Oum was still in the Dangrek.

1907, it could never have been a decision to adopt a line corre-
sponding with that on Annex I, or a line shown on a sketch or map.
It would seem probable that it could only have been one to the
effect that between the point on the Kel Pass on the west and an
agreed point at the Mekong on the east the frontier line would be
that stipulated in Article 1 of the Treaty, namely the line of the
watershed on the Dangrek and the crest on the Pnom Padang.

Although, however, it is established that there never could have
been any delimitation which adopted a line on any sketch or map,
it does not follow that there was no delimitation of the Dangrek
by the Mixed Commission.


*
* *

Since the Minutes of the Mixed Commission cover, as I am satis-
fied they do, all meetings of the Mixed Commission and record all
decisions taken by it, if there were any delimitation of the northern
frontier line, in particular of the Dangrek, it should be capable of
being ascertained from them.

One possibility has been canvassed during the case, namely that
during the reconnaissance of the northern frontier made by the
Mixed Commission there may have been a decision taken by it,
in which it was decided that the frontier line in the region of the
Temple should for some local or other reason run in such a manner
that the Temple would be on the Cambodian side of the boundary.

Apart from what I think is the inherent unlikelihood of such a
decision, it is straining credulity too far to suggest that it would
find no mention in the Minutes of the Mixed Commission. I am



quite unconvinced by attempts to explain this away by a suggestion
that perhaps there was not sufficient opportunity to record the
decision after the Mixed Commission had completed its reconnais-
sance, and that perhaps such a decision or at least one which

There was an opportunity on 3 January to record whatever
decisions the Mixed Commission may have made in the course of
its reconnaissance. If that opportunity was not sufficient there was
another on the 18th of that month. Moreover, if any delimitation
in relation to the Temple region had been made by the Mixed Com-
mission it passes understanding why it—or any decision other than
those recorded in the Minutes—was not mentioned at any time by
Colonel Bernard in his numerous official letters and reports to his
superiors at the time, and in particular was not mentioned in his
report of 20 February 1907 to the French Minister in Bangkok—a
document of cardinal importance in the case—when he reviewed
in full the delimitation under the 1904 Treaty made in the course
of its final campaign and covering as it did the frontier line from

Moreover Colonel Bernard—as appears from his final report dated
14 April 1908 to the French Minister of the Colonies before referred
to, had “in letters written day by day” reported to the Minister
“all the incidents that occurred” during the course of the delimi-
tation. Yet not the slightest hint of any decision in connection with
the Temple area or the region of the Temple is to be found.

Colonel Bernard attached to this report a number of documents
including the Minutes of the Mixed Commission which in his view
were “from the diplomatic point of view of considerable im-
portance”.

It does not seem likely that Colonel Bernard would have sent
incomplete minutes or if for any reason there had, on 18 January
1907, been any decisions of delimitation which had not been rec-
orded, particularly a decision relating to the Temple itself, that
he would have failed to make the record complete by referring to
them.

*
* *


In my view the reference is to the whole frontier line from the
Great Lake to the Mekong which was the subject of the Mixed
Commission’s third and last campaign directed to the delimitation
of the frontier defined in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1904.

The question is whether the evidence establishes that the Mixed
Commission did delimit the whole frontier line defined in that
Article; and if so whether there can, with sufficient certainty, be
extracted from the Minutes the nature of the delimitation made on
the Dangrek.

of the northern frontier as determined by it. None arises in respect
to the eastern extremity of that frontier.

The question however is whether there is evidence which suffi-
ciently establishes a delimitation—particularly on the Dangrek—
of the frontier between these two extremities.

Temple. This fixation of attention on Annex I and upon this small


II4 JUDGM. I5 VI 62 (DISS. OP. SIR PERCY SPENDER)

sector of the frontier line adjacent to the Temple has tended to
distract attention from the fact that the northern frontier was not
a number of separate frontier sectors and was not considered by the
Mixed Commission on that basis. It was one line of frontier and
the Mixed Commission dealt with it as such.

+
* *

The beginning of December 1906 marked what Colonel Bernard
referred to as the third campaign of delimitation.

At that point of time the Commission had completed its task of
delimitation of all the frontier defined in the Treaty and Protocol

pected to arrive on 10 February. I understand that, throughout the
operations, relations with the Royal Commissioners left nothing to
be desired and that the frontier line has been definitively determined
except in respect of the region of Siem Reap.”

I do not doubt that the view expressed in these two documents,
which is confirmed in other official documents of the same time,
correctly represents the views of the Presidents of both the French
and the Siamese Commissions.

The statement that the frontier had been definitively determined
is consistent with the Minutes of the Second Mixed Commission
appointed under the Treaty of 1907 to delimit the new frontiers in
which, when dealing with a sketch of the proposed frontier of the
Dangrek west of the Kel Pass placed before it on 22 March 1908,
there appears the statement “the latter pass is the point where
the new frontier line rejoins the former one”.

Since there is no reason to doubt the statements made by Colonel
Bernard at the time, it seems proper to conclude that the northern
frontier in fact had been delimited and that such delimitation must
have been completed by 18 January 1907, the date of the Mixed
Commission’s last meeting.

On that date the Minutes record as follows:

“Colonel Bernard passed to the question of the determination of
the frontier in the region of Pnom Pa Dang (Phu Pha Dang). Accord-
ing to the terms of the treaty that frontier followed the crest... as
far as the Mekong... In order to have a very distinct frontier in the

“The frontier line having been thus determined...”
It is known that at this date the topographical and survey officers
were in the field, from which they were not to return until a month


and more later. It would seem however that the Mixed Commission,
having made this decision—the last decision of delimitation set out
in the Minutes—regarded the frontier line as having been deter-
mined by it—at least so far as it could be done by it on the spot.

*
* *

The statement that “The frontier line” had been “thus deter-
mined” is not free from doubt. It could and on its face appears to
refer solely to the fixing of the point at the Mekong and the frontier
immediately adjacent. Read however in the light of the repeated
statement of Colonel Bernard that the whole frontier had been

must, for reasons already given, be dismissed from consideration,
there seems little doubt that, if the delimitation of the frontier
under the Treaty was completed, as Colonel Bernard specifically
states as the fact, and as the Minutes themselves go to indicate,
it must have been the line of the watershed on the Dangrek which



it was agreed should constitute the frontier line in that region.

The Presidents of the two Commissions were practical men. The
mountain ranges of the Dangrek and the Pnom Pa Dang were in
inhospitable and forbidding terrain. They were called on to make
a practical decision.

No question of demarking the northern frontier ever arose and,

so far as the record shows, that frontier has never been demarked
during the fifty odd intervening years. It remains much the same
today as it was then. The Mixed Commission appears to have de-
cided to fix the points of the extremities of the northern frontier
on the west and on the east and to have agreed that between those
two points the frontier needed no further delimitation other than
the Treaty itself provided.
The stipulation of the line of the watershed on the Dangrek—and
the crest line on the Pnom Padang was itself an obvious and ap-
propriate way of defining definitively and with certainty the north-
ern frontier line. There is no reason why the Mixed Commission
having once fixed or decided to fix the points of its extremities
should not have delimited that frontier by reference to its definition
in the Treaty. The line of the watershed—and the crest line—were
natural and permanent lines. There are, as the Judgment of the
Court points out, boundary treaties which do no more than refer
to a watershed line or a crest line and which make no provision for
any further delimitation. It is not evident why the Mixed Com-
mission should have felt obliged to give to the line of the watershed
—or the crest line—any more specific delimitation than that which
the Treaty already provided. As already noted, the Mixed Com-
mission under the 1907 Treaty in delimiting the Dangrek west of
the Kel Pass did not feel obliged to do so. That Mixed Commission
recorded its decision specifically to read “From the last mentioned
point the frontier inclines to the East, following the watershed be-
tween the basin of the Great Lake and that of the Semoun as far as
the Kel Pass.”

It is a misconception of the functions of the Mixed Commission
to suggest that it was bound to give or should be expected to have
given a further definition to the northern frontier or any part of it
beyond that which the Treaty already provided.

The northern frontier was after all a part only, and a lesser part
both in magnitude and importance, of the whole frontier described
in the Treaty and Protocol of 1904.

It is moreover in my opinion without warrant to suggest that
France and Siam did not attach any special importance to the line
of the watershed as such. This suggestion is not reconcilable with



the fact that in the Treaty of 1907, more than two months after
the Mixed Commission had held its last meeting, it is the line of the
watershed which is again stipulated should be the frontier line on
the Dangrek and when in 1949 France and later Cambodia, in
1954, protested Thailand’s occupancy of the Temple area, it was the
line of the watershed as defined in the Treaty of 1907 which, it was
insisted, continued to be the frontier between the two States.

In particular there is no reason whatever why the Mixed Com-
mission should not have agreed that, from a fixed point on the
Dangrek where that range was met by the meridian, the frontier
should be the line of the watershed on the Dangrek until it joined

decision it did take.

Nor is there any reason why a delimitation of the Dangrek re-
quired any line shown on any map either to establish a delimitation
or to confirm one. Nowhere does the Treaty of 1904 give any in-
dication that any map was necessary or considered desirable to
accomplish a delimitation of any part of the frontier.

The assertion that it was the map line of the watershed, not the
- Treaty line of the watershed, which was regarded as of overriding
importance, I do not find supportable. If the assertion were correct,
it would mean that agreement between the two States was not in
1908-1909 a mere formality as has been contended; it was the very
gist of the delimitation of the Dangrek. The map would itself consti-
tute the delimitation. If the assertion were correct all that needs
to be said is that the two States in 1908-1909 could not have
conducted themselves in a more casual and inconsequential manner
in matters affecting territorial sovereignty.

If the delimitation of the northern frontier had been made by
the Mixed Commission in 1906-1907 in terms of the line of the
watershed as defined in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1904, a map
subsequently produced by France or Siam was not in any manner
necessary to give effect to that decision. À frontier line shown on
such a map would possess no probative value—except to the extent
to which it was in conformity with the decision of delimitation of
which the map in a general sense might be said to have been an
outcome.

If the Mixed Commission did in fact delimit the Dangrek, it
would seem evident that it did so by reference to the Treaty line
of the watershed.

That this was the course followed by the Mixed Commission finds

IIQ JUDGM. 15 VI 62 (DISS. OP. SIR PERCY SPENDER)

In the first place the procedure followed accords with that laid
down by the Mixed Commission at the commencement of its labours
in 1905, namely that it would be sufficient to determine the principal
points through which the frontier in any region passed®.

It accords also with the procedure which, as will appear, was
followed in other frontier regions covered by the Treaty of 1904
where a watershed line was to form part of the frontier line?

The procedure appears to have been constant.

Light upon the meaning of the decision of the Mixed Commission,
recorded in the Minutes of its Meeting of 18 January 1907, is shed


Colonel Bernard reported as follows:

! Minute of Meeting of 7 February 1905.
? See Article 2 of the Treaty and Articles I and II of the Protocol.



“All along the Dangrek and as far as the Mekong the fixing of the
frontier could not have involved any difficulty. It was only a question
of determining at what point the Pnom Padang adjoins the Mekong.
On this point there was no possible discussion for the mountain joins
the river at one point only about seven kilometres below Paknam.”

watershed.

Colonel Bernard, who knew exactly what was decided by the
Mixed Commission during the third campaign and the basis on
which the delimitation of the northern frontier was effected, must
have understood that the fixing of the point at which the Pnom
Padang adjoined the Mekong, as recorded in the Minutes of 18
January 1907, was the last decision necessary to be taken to delimit
the whole of the northern frontier.

The fact that the second Mixed Commission, under the Treaty and
Protocol of 1907, delimited the frontier from west of the Kel Pass
until it reached that pass by strictly adhering to the line of the
watershed, serves to show a consistency of treatment by both Com-
missions of the whole frontier line of the Dangrek.

When Colonel Bernard reported that the frontiers had been de-
finitively determined he was I think stating the fact. The manner
in which the delimitation of the northern frontier was effected is
apparent. Once the point on the Mekong had been agreed to, that
frontier followed the treaty line stipulated in Article 1, namely the
crest of the Pnom Padang and the watershed of the Dangrek, until


IZI JUDGM. I5 Vi 62 (DISS. OP. SIR PERCY SPENDER)

it reached the point at which on the latter mountain range it met
the meridian mentioned in the article. Whatever decision or view-
point was arrived at or expressed by the two Presidents during
their reconnaissance of the Dangrek and the Pnom Padang, or at
any time, would accord with this view.

Colonel Bernard has left his testimony.

In the lecture given by him in Paris on 20 December 1907, he
described the three campaigns of delimitation from 1905 to 1907.
What he has to say he says with illuminating conciseness. These
are his words:

“Almost everywhere it was the watershed which formed the
frontier and there was room for argument only at the two extremities.”

His testimony remains to explain the meaning which should, I
am convinced, be given to the Minutes which cover the third and
last campaign of the Mixed Commission. The view he expressed
seems eminently a commonsense one.

The review made of the Minutes and the contemporaneous docu-
ments lead I think to the following conclusions:

1. There was no adaptation of the treaty line of the watershed
on the Dangrek by the Mixed Commission to meet any local or
special problem, condition or circumstance.

2. There was no decison of delimitation which specifically dealt
with the Temple region or area.

3. There was no decision of any kind to deviate from the line of

map which purports to reflect that decision. The map merely notes
or purports to note that decision.

If the line of frontier shown on Annex I does not accord with
that decision to the extent to which it does not, it is devoid of
probative value, unless of course it has since acquired probative
force from some other source.

Annex I in fact is not in conformity with the treaty line of the
watershed stipulated in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1904. Leaving
aside for the moment the comparatively small and limited area
immediately adjacent to the site of the Temple, elsewhere the fron-
tier line delineated in Annex I deviates considerably from the treaty
line of the watershed. Having regard to the expert evidence placed
before the Court by both Cambodia and Thailand, this cannot be
disputed.

This deviation was due to a serious mistake in the construction
of Annex I made in the line of the watershed close to the site of
the Temple, a mistake caused by an incorrect location of a river
known as the O’Tasem. This mistake resulted in throwing the fron-
tier line shown on Annex I completely out of alignment with the
line of the watershed in the region of the Temple. The result was
to leave the Temple wholly within the territory of Cambodia.

The experts from both sides are also in agreement that in the

error in relation to the frontier line near the Temple shown on
Annex I needs further explanation.

The river O’Tasem in fact passes to the south of a mountain
known as Pnom Trap—which is situate but a few kilometres to the
west of the Temple. The course of the river as it is today is the same
as it was at the beginning of this century and for hundreds of years
before then. Annex I however places the river as running around
this mountain to the north of it.

The nature of the mistake is made clear by Professor Schermer-
horn, the Dean of the International Training Centre for Aerial
Survey at Delft, and his explanation was fully confirmed by the
observations and evidence of one of his officers, a Dr. Ackermann,
who went to the area to qualify himself to give evidence of what

he observed on the spot.

Professor Schermerhorn in his evidence stated:

“It 1s obvious that the border line shown on the Annex I map
was drawn by constructing the watershed line in accordance with
the contour lines represented there. This construction was done
correctly on the basis of the given contour lines. However, due to
the mistake about the O’Tasem river, the line of the watershed is
shifted incorrectly to the north, placing the Pnom Trap mountain
completely in Cambodian territory that is to say south of the border
line as drawn in the Annex I map. This displacement of the water-
shed line to the north goes up to two kilometres at certain points.
If this mistake is rectified in the Annex I map then the watershed
constructed on the basis of the correct contour lines would be in
agreement with the I.T.C. map [that of the International Training
Centre at Delft]. In that case the watershed would run over the
Pnom Trap mountain and go from there along the southern rim of
the Phra Viharn mountain to the temple.”

This was a fundamental error in the construction of the frontier
line in Annex I. The significance of this mistake in relation to the
frontier line shown on Annex I in this region is evident having
regard to the close proximity of the Pnom Trap mountain to the
Temple and the mountain on which it stands. By placing the river
O’Tasem to the north of Pnom Trap mountain the line of the
watershed as shown on Annex I was thrown considerably north of
the correct watershed line, attributing to Cambodia territory to
which she was not entitled. The fact that from the southern edge
of the cliff face on which the Temple is situate to the watershed line

frontier line shown on Annex I, more particularly so since this mis-
take was discovered in 1908 and corrected by two survey officers
appointed by the second Mixed Commission to put down boundary
marks in the vicinity of Kel Pass. The fact is that at the Kel Pass
the accepted boundary is not, and has not since 1908, been, that
shown on Annex I.

Finally, having regard to the technical evidence presented to the
Court by both Cambodia and Thailand, I am left in no doubt that
the line of the watershed today—and in 1904—runs along the
southern rim of the Phra Viharn mountain, thus placing the Temple
on the Thai side of the line.
