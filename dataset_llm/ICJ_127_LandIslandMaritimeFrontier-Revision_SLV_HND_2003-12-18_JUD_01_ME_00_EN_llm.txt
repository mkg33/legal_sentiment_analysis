15, By a Judgment of 11 September 1992, the Chamber of the Court
formed to deal with the case concerning the Land, Island and Maritime
Frontier Dispute ( El Salvador/Honduras: Nicaragua intervening) decided
the course of the land boundary between El Salvador and Honduras
in six disputed sectors of that boundary. By the same Judgment the
Chamber settled the dispute between the Parties over the legal status of
various islands in the Gulf of Fonseca and the legal status of waters in
the Gulf and outside it.

16. El Salvador has submitted an Application to the Court for revision
of the 1992 Judgment in respect of the sixth sector of the lund boundary,
lying between Los Amates and the Gulf of Fonseca. During the original
proceedings, it was the contention of Honduras that in that sector “the
boundary . . . follows the present stream [of the River Goascoran)], flow-
ing into the Gulf north-west of the Islas Ramaditas in the Bay of
La Unién”. El Salvador however claimed that the boundary was defined
by “a previous course followed by the river . . . and that this course, since
abandoned by the stream, can be traced, and it reaches the Gulf at Estero
La Cutt” (Judgment, para. 306). In the Judgment revision of which is



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 398

now sought, the Chamber unanimously upheld the submissions of Hon-
duras (Judgment, paras. 321, 322 and 430).

17. In its Application for revision of the 1992 Judgment, E! Salvador
relies on Article 61 of the Statute, which provides:

“1. An application for revision of a judgment may be made only
when it is based upon the discovery of some fact of such a nature as
to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment was given,
unknown to the Court and also to the party claiming revision,
always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence.

2. The proceedings for revision shall be opened by a judgment of
the Court expressly recording the existence of the new fact, recog-
nizing that it has such a character as to lay the case open to revision,
and declaring the application admissible on this ground.

3. The Court may require previous compliance with the terms of
the judgment before it admits proceedings in revision.

4. The application for revision must be made at latest within six
months of the discovery of the new fact.

5. No application for revision may be made after the lapse of ten
vears from the date of the judgment.”

18. Article 61 provides for revision proceedings to open with a judg-
ment of the Court declaring the application admissible on the grounds
contemplated by the Statute; Article 99 of the Rules of Court makes
express provision for proceedings on the merits if, in its first judgment,
the Court has declared the application admissible.

Thus the Statute and the Rules of Court foresee a “two-stage pro-
cedure”. The first stage of the procedure for a request for revision of
the Court’s judgment should be “limited to the question of admissibility
of that request” (Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judg-
ment of 24 February 1982 in the Case concerning the Continental Shelf
(Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (Tunisia v. Libyan Arab Jamahiriva),
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1985, p. 197, paras. 8 and 10; Application for
Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Applica-
tion of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objec-
tions ( Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judgment, I. C.J. Reports
2003, p. 11, para. 15}.

19. Therefore, at this stage, the present Chamber’s decision is limited
to the question whether El Salvador’s request satisfies the conditions
contemplated by the Statute. Under Article 61, these conditions are as
follows:

{a) the application should be based upon the “discovery” of a “fact”;

{b} the fact the discovery of which is relied on must be “of such a nature
as to be a decisive factor”;

(e) the fact should have been “unknown” to the Court and to the party
claiming revision when the judgment was given;


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 399

(d) ignorance of this fact must not be “due to negligence”; and

{e) the application for revision must be “made at latest within six
months of the discovery of the new fact” and before ten years have
elapsed from the date of the judgment.

20. The Chamber observes lastly that “an application for revision is
admissible only if each of the conditions laid down in Article 61 is satis-
fied. If any one of them is not met, the application must be dismissed.”
(Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case
concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia),
Preliminary Objections { Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), Judg-
ment, I C.J. Reports 2003, p. 12, para. 17.)

21. However, El Salvador appears to argue in fimine that there is no
need for the Chamber to consider whether the conditions of Article 61 of
the Statute have been satisfied. According to the Applicant,

“Honduras implicitly acknowledged the admissibility of El Salva-
dor’s Application when, by letter dated 29 October 2002, it informed
the distinguished President of the Court that, pursuant to Article 61,
paragraph 3, of the Statute, it would ask that the Court require pre-
vious compliance with the 1992 Judgment as a condition precedent
to the admissibility of the Application for revision.’

In El Salvador’s view, “The back step that Honduras took with its letter
of 24 July 2003”, by which it decided not to ask for prior compliance with
the judgment, “does nothing to diminish [the] acknowledgment [of the
admissibility of the Application], and instead serves to confirm it.” The
Chamber is consequently requested to “adjudge and decide accordingly”.

22. The Chamber observes first that, in its letter of 29 October 2002,
Honduras informed the President of the Court that it would “request
that the Court make the admission of the proceedings in revision condi-
tional on previous compliance with the judgment” and that accordingly it
would “submit a formal petition” to that effect. However, Honduras
never submitted that request and stated in its observations of 24 July 2003
(see paragraph 9 above) that it had “decided, on reflection, not to ask the
Chamber to require prior compliance with the terms of the Judgment”.
Thus, Honduras’s conduct cannot be construed as implying a tacit accept-
ance of the admissibility of El Salvador’s Application for revision.

Further, paragraph 3 of Article 61 of the Statute and paragraph 5 of
Article 99 of the Rules of Court afford the Court the possibility at any
time to require previous compliance with the terms of the judgment
whose revision is sought, before it admits proceedings in revision; accord-
ingly, even if Honduras had submitted a request to the Court to require
previous compliance without awaiting the Chamber’s decision on the


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 400

admissibility of El Salvador’s Application, the request would not have
implied recognition of the admissibility of the Application.

Finally, the Chamber notes that, regardless of the parties’ views on the
admissibility of an application for revision, it is in any event for the
Court, when seised of such an application, to ascertain whether the
admissibility requirements laid down in Article 61 of the Statute have
been met. Revision is not available simply by consent of the parties, but
solely when the conditions of Article 61 are met.

23, In order properly to understand El Salvador’s present contentions,
it is necessary to recapitulate at the outset part of the reasoning in the
1992 Judgment in respect of the sixth sector of the land boundary.

El Salvador admitted before the Chamber hearing the original case
that the river Goascorän had been adopted as the provincial boundary
during the period of Spanish colonization. It argued, however, that

“at some date [the Goascorän] abruptly changed its course to its
present position. On this basis El Salvador’s argument of law [was]
that where a boundary is formed by the course of a river, and the
stream suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, this process
of ‘avulsion’ does not bring about a change in the boundary, which
continues to follow the old channel.” (Para. 308.)

That was claimed te be the rule under both Spanish colonial law and
international law, Thus, according to El Salvador, the boundary between
the two States should be established not along the present stream of the
river, flowing into the Bay of La Unidn, but along the “previous course . .
since abandoned by the stream”, probably during the seventeenth cen-
tury, emptying into the Estero La Cutû (paras. 306 and 311).

24. After setting out this argument by El Salvador, the Chamber
stated in its Judgment of 11 September 1992 that “No record of such an
abrupt change of course having occurred has been brought to the Cham-
ber’s attention” (para. 308). It added: “were the Chamber satisfied that
the river's course was earlier so radically different from its present one,
then an avulsion might reasonably be inferred” {para. 308). The Cham-
ber observed, however, that: “There is no scientific evidence that the pre-
vious course of the Goascoran was such that it debouched in the Estero
La Cutt” or in another neighbouring inlet (para. 309). It did not take a
position on the consequences that any avulsion, occurring before or after
1821, would have had on provincial boundaries, or boundaries between
States, under Spanish colonial law or international law.

The Chamber went on to find that “any claim by El Salvador that the
boundary follows an old course of the river abandoned at some time



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 401

before 1821 must be rejected. It is a new claim and inconsistent with the
previous history of the dispute.” (Para. 312.) In this regard, the Chamber
noted inter alia that on several occasions, including in particular during
the Saco negotiations between the two States in 1880, El Salvador had
adopted conduct excluding any “claim . . . that the 1821 boundary was
not the 1821 course of the river, but an older course, preserved as provin-
cial boundary by a provision of colonial law” (para. 312).

The Chamber then considered “the evidence made available to it con-
cerning the course of the river Goascoran in 1821” {para. 313). It exam-
ined in particular a “chart (described as a ‘Carta Esférica’) of the Gulf of
Fonseca prepared by the captain and navigators of the brig or brigantine
El Active, who sailed in 1794, on the instructions of the Viceroy of
Mexico, to survey the Gulf” (para. 314). It noted that the mouth of the
Goascorän on that chart was “quite inconsistent with the old course of
the river alleged by El Salvador, or, indeed, any course other than the
present-day one” (para. 314). The Chamber concluded that “the report of
the 1794 expedition and the ‘Carta Esférica’ leave little room for doubt
that the river Goascoran in 1821 was already flowing in its present-day
course” (para. 316).

Finally, after having exammed various other arguments by El Salvador
which it is not necessary to repeat here, the Chamber “found that the
boundary follows the present course of the Goascoran” (para. 319) and
defined the boundary line in the mouth of the river (paras. 320-322},

*

25. In its Application for revision, El Salvador, acting under Article 61
of the Statute, relies on facts which it considers to be new within the
meaning of that Article; those facts relate, on the one hand, to the avul-
sion of the river Goascoran and, on the other, to the “Carta Esférica”
and the report of the 1794 EI Active expedition.

* #

26. El Salvador first claims to possess scientific, technical and histori-
cal evidence showing, contrary to what it understands the decision of the
Chamber to have been, that the Goascorän did in the past change its bed,
and that the change was abrupt, probably as a result of a cyclone in 1762.

In support of this contention El Salvador submits to the Chamber a
report dated 5 August 2002 entitled Geologic, Hydrologic and Historic
Aspects of the Goascordn Delta — A Basis for Boundary Determination.
It also produces a study it conducted in 2002 “to check for the presence
of vestiges of the Goascoran’s original riverbed and additional informa-
tion about its hydrographic behaviour”. Finally, it refers to various pub-



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 402

lications, including in particular Geografia de Honduras by Ulises Meza
Câlix, published in 1916, and Monografia del Departamento de Valle,
prepared under the direction of Bernardo Galindo y Galindo and pub-
lished in 1934.

27. El Salvador argues that evidence can constitute “new facts” for
purposes of Article 61 of the Statute. In this regard it relies on the
travaux préparatoires of the provision of the Statute of the Permanent
Court of International Justice, on which Article 61 is modelled, which are
said to confirm that a document can be considered to be a “new fact”. It
also invokes an arbitral award handed down on 7 August and 25 Sep-
tember 1922 by the Franco-German Mixed Arbitral Tribunal in the
Heim et Chamant c. Etat allemand case, which, in El Salvador’s view,
recognized that evidence can constitute “a fact”.

El Salvador further contends that the evidence 1t is now offering estab-
lishes the existence of an old bed of the Goascoran debouching in the
Estero La Cutt, and the avulsion of the river in the mid-eighteenth cen-
tury or that, at the very least, it justifies regarding such an avulsion as
plausible. These are said to be “new facts” for purposes of Article 61.

28. The facts thus set out are, according to El Salvador, decisive. Tt
maintains that the considerations and conclusions of the 1992 Judgment
are founded on the rejection of an avulsion which, in the Chamber's
view, had not been proved: that avulsion has ceased to be a matter of
conjecture — it is an established fact which actually occurred. On the
basis of Spanish colonial law, the provincial boundaries remained un-
changed, notwithstanding the avulsion, until 1821. El Salvador concludes
that, contrary to what the Chamber held in 1992, the boundary arising
from the uti possidetis juris should accordingly follow those boundaries
and not the new course of the Goascoran.

29. El Salvador finally maintains that, given all the circumstances of
the case, in particular the “bitter civil war [which] was raging in El Sal-
vador” “for virtually the whole period between 1980 and the handing
down of the Judgment on 11 September 1992”, its ignorance of the
various new facts which it now advances concerning the course of the
Goascoran was not due to negligence,

In particular, it states that the scientific and technical studies it has
produced could not have been carried out previously, given both the state
of science and technology in 1992, and the political situation prevailing at
the time in the sixth sector of the boundary and, generally, in El Salvador
and the region. As for the publications mentioned above (see para-
graph 26), El Salvador contends that it could not have “access to the
documents in Honduras’s National Archives and, despite all its efforts,
could not locate them in the archives of other States to which it did have
access”.

30. El Salvador concludes from the foregoing that, as the various con-



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 403

ditions laid down by Article 61 of the Statute are satisfied, the Applica-
tion for revision founded on the avulsion of the river Goascorän is
admissible.

31, Honduras, for its part, argues that with regard to the application
of Article 61 of the Statute, it is “well-established case law that there is a
distinction in kind between the facts alleged and the evidence relied upon
to prove them and that only the discovery of the former opens a right to
revision”. It quotes in this connection the Advisory Opinion rendered on
4 September 1924 by the Permanent Court of International Justice con-
cerning the question of the Monastery of Saint-Naourn. According to
Honduras, a “fact” cannot “include evidentiary material in support of an
argument, or an assertion, or an allegation”, Accordingly, the evidence
submitted by El Salvador cannot open a right to revision.

Honduras adds that El Salvador has not demonstrated the existence of
a new fact discovered by El Salvador since 1992 “which establishes that
the Goascoran River previously ran in a former bed which debouched at
Estero La Cutû or that a process of ‘avulsion’ occurred, or that it
occurred on a particular date”. In reality, El Salvador is seeking “a new
interpretation of previously known facts” and asking the Chamber for a
“genuine reversal” of the 1992 Judgment.

32. Honduras further maintains that the facts relied on by El Salva-
dor, even if assumed to be new and established, are not of such a nature
as to be decisive factors in respect of the 1992 Judgment. According to
Honduras, “the material presented by El Salvador on that subject is
irrelevant to the operative factual determination” made at that time by
the Chamber. That decision is alleged to have been founded solely on the
finding of fact that “from 1880, during the Saco negotiations, until 1972
El Salvador had treated the boundary as being based on the 1821 course
of the river”. The Chamber is said to have acted on that basis alone when
in paragraph 312 of its Judgment it rejected El Salvador’s claim “that the
boundary follows an old course of the river abandoned at some time
before 18217, considering it to be “a new claim and inconsistent with the
previous history of the dispute”. Thus, according to Honduras, it does
not matter whether or not there was avulsion: avulsion is irrelevant to
the ratio decidendi of the Chamber.

33. Honduras argues lastly that El Salvador’s ignorance in 1992 of the
facts on which it is relying in the present proceedings in support of its
theory of avulsion was due to negligence. El Salvador has “never proved
that it exhausted — or even initiated — means that would have given it
diligent knowledge of the facts that it is alleging today”. In Honduras’s
view, El Salvador could have had the scientific and technical studies and
historical research which it is now relying on carried out before 1992.

34. Honduras concludes from the foregoing that, as the various con-
ditions laid down by Article 61 of the Statute have not been satisfied, the
Application for revision founded on the avulsion of the river Goascoran
is not admissible.



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 404

35. Finally, the Parties raise the question whether the Application for
revision was properly made within the six-month time-limit stipulated in
paragraph 4 of Article 61 of the Statute. They do acknowledge, however,
that the Application was submitted within the ten-year time-limit pro-
vided for in paragraph 5 of that Article, specifically, one day before the
expiry of that time-limit. Honduras maintains nevertheless that, by pro-
ceeding in this fashion, the Applicant showed procedural bad faith. That
is denied by El Salvador.

+

36. Turning to consideration of El Salvador’s submissions concerning
the avulsion of the Goascoran, the Chamber recalls that an application
for revision is admissible only if each of the conditions laid down in Ar-
ticle 61 is satisfied, and that if any one of them is not met, the application
must be dismissed; in the present case, the Chamber will begin by ascer-
taining whether the alleged facts, supposing them to be new facts, are of
such a nature as to be decisive factors in respect of the 1992 Judgment.

37. In this regard, it is appropriate first to recall the considerations of
principle on which the Chamber hearing the original case relied for its
ruling on the disputes between the two States in six sectors of their land
boundary,

According to that Chamber, the boundary was to be determined “by
the application of the principle generally accepted in Spanish America of
the uti possidetis juris, whereby the boundaries were to follow the colo-
nial administrative boundaries” (para. 28). The Chamber did however
note that “the wri possidetis juris position can be qualified by adjudica-
tion and by treaty”. It reasoned from this that “the question then arises
whether it can be qualified in other ways, for example, by acquiescence or
recognition”. It concluded that

“There seems to be no reason in principle why these factors
should not operate, where there is sufficient evidence to show that
the parties have in effect clearly accepted a variation, or at least an
interpretation, of the uti possidetis juris position.” (Para. 67.)

Applying these principles to the first sector of the land boundary, the
Chamber considered that in this sector “The situation was susceptibie of
modification by acquiescence in the lengthy intervening period” since the
early nineteenth century. It added that, whatever may have been the colo-
nial administrative boundaries, “the conduct of Honduras from 1881
until 1972 may be regarded as amounting to such acquiescence” to a part
of the boundary claimed by El Salvador in this sector (para. 80.

38. The Chamber proceeded similarly in paragraphs 306 to 322 of
its Judgment in respect of the sixth sector. After having identified the



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 405

object of the dispute in this sector in paragraph 306, the Chamber first
observed

“that during the colonial period a river called the Goascorän con-
stituted the boundary between two administrative divisions of the
Captaincy-General of Guatemala: the province of San Miguel and
the Alcaldia Mayor de Minas of Tegucigalpa” (para. 307),

The Parties were in agreement that El Salvador had succeeded in 1821
to the territory of the Province of San Miguel, On the other hand, they
disagreed as to whether or not the Alcaldia Mayor of Tegucigalpa had
passed to Honduras. The Chamber decided that point in favour of
Honduras (ibid ).

The Chamber then considered “The contention of El Salvador that a
former bed of the river Goascoran forms the uti possidetis juris bound-
ary.” In this respect, it observed that:

“[this contention] depends, as a question of fact, on the assertion
that the Goascorän formerly was running in that bed, and that at
some date it abruptly changed its course to its present position. On
this basis El Salvador’s argument of law is that where a boundary is
formed by the course of a river, and the stream suddenly leaves its
old bed and forms a new one, this process of ‘avulsion’ does not
bring about a change in the boundary, which continues to follow the
old channel.” (Para, 308.)

The Chamber added that:

“No record of such an abrupt change of course having occurred
has been brought to the Chamber’s attention, but were the Chamber
satisfied that the river's course was earlier so radically different from
its present one, then an avulsion might reasonably be inferred.”
{ Ibid. }

Pursuing its consideration of El Salvador’s argument, the Chamber did
however note:

“There is no scientific evidence that the previous course of the
Goascoran was such that it debouched in the Estero La Cutü . . .
rather than in any of the other neighbouring inlets in the coastline,
such as the Estero El Coyol.” (Para. 309.)

Turning to consideration as a matter of law of El Salvador’s proposi-
tion concerning the avulsion of the Goascorän, the Chamber observed
that El Salvador “suggests . . . that the change in fact took place in the
17th century” (para. 311). It concluded that, “On this basis, what inter-
national law may have to say, on the question of the shifting of rivers
which form frontiers, becomes irrelevant: the problem is mainly one of
Spanish colonial law.” (Para. 311.)

At the conclusion of its consideration of El Salvador’s line of argument



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 406

as to the avulsion of the Goascoran, the Chamber did not take any posi-
tion on the existence of an earlier course of the Goascoran which might
have debouched into the Estero La Cutüù, or on any avulsion of the river,
nor à fortiori, on the date of any such avulsion or its legal consequences.
It confined itself to defining the framework in which it could possibly
have taken a position on these various points.

39. Beginning in paragraph 312 of the Judgment, the Chamber turned
to a consideration of a different ground. At the outset, it tersely stated
the conclusions which it had reached and then set out the reasoning sup-
porting them. In the view of the Chamber, “any claim by El Salvador
that the boundary follows an old course of the river abandoned at some
time before 1821 must be rejected. It is a new claim and inconsistent with
the previous history of the dispute.” (Para. 312.)

The Chamber then noted: “A specific assertion that the boundary
should follow an abandoned course of the river Goascoran was first
made during the Antigua negotiations in 1972” (para. 312). It also
quoted an excerpt from the record of the negotiations between the two
States at Saco in 1880, stating that the two delegates had agreed “to recog-
nize” the river Goascoran “as the frontier between the two Republics,
from its mouth in the Gulf of Fonseca, Bay of La Union, upstream in a
north-easterly direction . . .” (ibid). The Chamber observed that to
interpret “the words ‘River Goascoran’ [in the text] as meaning a Spanish
colonial boundary which in 1821 followed a long-abandoned course of
the river, is out of the question” (ibid. ). It added that similar considera-
tions applied to the circumstances of further negotiations in 1884
(para. 317).

Having on these grounds arrived at the conclusion that the boundary
in 1821 followed the course of the Goascoran at that date, the Chamber
turned to consideration of the evidence submitted to it in respect of that
course (paras. 313 et seq.), evidence which will be examined in due course
(see paragraph 50 below).

40. It is apparent from this discussion that, while the Chamber in 1992
rejected El Salvador’s claims that the 1821 boundary did not follow the
course of the river at that date, it did so on the basis of that State’s con-
duct during the nineteenth century. In other words, applying the general
rule which it had enunciated in paragraph 67 of the Judgment, the Cham-
ber proceeded, in paragraph 312, concerning the sixth sector of the land
boundary, by employing reasoning analogous to that which it had
adopted in paragraph 80 in respect of the first sector. In the sixth sector,
this reasoning led the Chamber to uphold the submissions of Honduras,
while in the first sector it had proved favourable to El Salvador’s posi-
tion.

In short, it does not matter whether or not there was an avulsion of the


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 407

Goascoran. Even if avulsion were now proved, and even if its legal con-
sequences were those inferred by El Salvador, findings to that effect
would provide no basis for calling into question the decision taken by the
Chamber in 1992 on wholly different grounds. The facts asserted in this
connection by El Salvador are not “decisive factors” in respect of the
Judgment which it seeks to have revised. In light of the 1992 Judgment,
the Chamber cannot but reach such a conclusion, independently of the
positions taken by the Parties on this point in the course of the present
proceedings.

*

41. In support of its Application for revision, El Salvador relies on a
second “new fact”, that is, the discovery in the Ayer Collection of the
Newberry Library in Chicago of a further copy of the “Carta Esférica”
and of a further copy of the report of the expedition of the El Activo,
thereby supplementing the copies from the Madrid Naval Museum to
which the Chamber made reference in paragraphs 314 and 316 of its
Judgment (see paragraph 24 above).

El Salvador states that in 1992, the Chamber had before it only copies
of the documents that had been obtained from Madrid, and been pro-
duced by Honduras. It contends that it was on the basis of those copies
that the Chamber decided the “point at which the Goascorän emptied
into the Gulf” and the course of the boundary.

According to El Salvador, the documents discovered in Chicago differ
from those in Madrid on several significant points. It maintains that:

“The fact that there are several versions of the ‘Carta Esférica’
and the Report of the Gulf of Fonseca from the El Activo expedi-
tion, that there are differences among them and the anachronisms
they share, compromises the evidentiary value that the Chamber
attached to the documents that Honduras presented, essential in the
Judgment [of 1992].”

Further, the evidentiary value is claimed to be all the more doubtful in
that the Madrid documents enjoyed no official status and have not been
certified to be originals. Accordingly, maintains El Salvador, there exists
“a second new fact, whose implications for the Judgment have to be con-
sidered once the application for revision is admitted”.

42. El Salvador adds that “[t]he discovery of hitherto unknown docu-
ments is a typical example of the type of fact which lays a case open to
revision . . . either because they themselves constitute the factum or
because they are the source of knowledge of them”. It further states that
“[e]vidence which rebuts a fact established by a judgment of which revi-
sion is sought undoubtedly constitutes a fact for purposes of Article 61 of
the Statute”.

El Salvador asserts that in the present case the fact in question pre-


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 408

dated the 1992 Judgment but was not “known at the time the Judgment
was given”. Thus, it is a “new fact” for purposes of Article 61. It 1s said
to be decisive because its discovery has highlighted “the insubstantiality
of the Madrid Naval Museum documents” from which the Chamber
inferred “such significant” geographical “consequences”.

43. Lastly, El Salvador states that the Ayer Collection is “not an indis-
pensable reference source” and that the E/ Activo expedition was not a
well-known expedition. It refers in more general terms to the “bitter civil
war [which] was raging in El Salvador” “for virtually the whole period
between 1980 and the handing down of the Judgment on El Septem-
ber 1992”. Accordingly, it argues, “El Salvador’s ignorance until 2002 of
the existence of copies of the Æ/ Activo documents in collections situated

ERE]

in out-of-the-way places cannot be characterized as ‘negligent’ ”.

44. El Salvador concludes from the foregoing that, as the various con-
ditions laid down by Article 61 of the Statute are satisfied, the Applica-
tion for revision founded on the discovery of the new chart and new
report is admissible.

45. For its part, Honduras denies that the production of the docu-
ments found in Chicago can be characterized as a new fact. This is simply
“another copy of one and the same document already submitted by Hon-
duras during the written stage of the case decided in 1992, and already
evaluated by the Chamber in its Judgment”. Honduras adds that it
“never sought to argue the point whether the spherical chart was an
original document (it always spoke of copies) or an official document”.
But it contends that there are no discrepancies between the three copies
of the chart, merely “insignificant differences”. Honduras maintains that
those differences in no way contradict the content of the logbook. Finally,
it notes that all three charts place the mouth of the river Goascoran in its
present-day position, a finding on which the 1992 Judgment was based
and which in any event remains valid.

46. Honduras further states that the new documents produced by
El Salvador were part of a prestigious public collection and have been
included in the Newberry Library catalogue at least since 1927. It con-
cludes from this that El Salvador could easily have learned of those docu-
ments, and that it breached its duty of diligence in failing to seek them
out or produce them before 1992. According to Honduras, no excuse for
this failure can be found in the internal conflict prevailing in El Salvador
at the time, as that conflict in no way prevented the conduct of research
outside the national territory.

47. Honduras concludes from the foregoing that, as the various con-
ditions laid down by Article 61 of the Statute are not satisfied, the Appli-
cation for revision founded on the discovery of the new chart and the
new report is not admissible.

48. Finally, as regards the conditions laid down in paragraphs 4 and 5
of Article 61 of the Statute, the Parties put forward arguments similar to



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 409

those they made in respect of the avulsion of the Goascorän (see para-
graph 35 above).

*

49, The Chamber will proceed, as it did in respect of the avulsion (see
paragraph 36 above), to determine first whether the alleged facts concern-
ing the “Carta Esférica” and the report of the El Activo expedition are of
such a nature as to be decisive factors in respect of the 1992 Judgment.

50, It should be recalled in this regard that the Chamber in 1992, after
having held El Salvador’s claims concerning the old course of the
Goascoran to be inconsistent with the previous history of the dispute,
considered “the evidence made available to it concerning the course of
the river Goascoran in 1821” (para. 313). It paid particular attention to
the chart prepared by the captain and navigators of the vessel El Activo
around 1796, described as a “Carta Esférica”, which Honduras had
found in the archives of the Madrid Naval Museum. It noted that the
chart

“appears to correspond with considerable accuracy to the topo-
graphy as shown on modern maps. It shows the ‘Estero Cutd’ in
the same position as modern maps; and it also shows a river mouth,
marked ‘R2 Goascoran’, at the point where the river Goascorän
today flows into the Gulf. Since the chart is one of the Gulf, pre-
sumably for navigational purposes, no features inland are shown
except the ©. . . best known volcanoes and peaks...” {. . . volcanes
y cerros mas conocidos . . ), visible to mariners; accordingly, no
course of the river upstream of its mouth is indicated. Nevertheless,
the position of the mouth is quite inconsistent with the old course of
the river alleged by El Salvador, or, indeed, any course other than
the present-day one. In two places, the chart mdicates the old and
new mouths of a river (e.g., ‘Barra vieja del Rio Nacaume’ and
‘Nuevo Rio de Nacaume”); since no ancient mouth is shown for the
Goascorän, this suggests that in 1796 it had for some considerable
time flowed into the Gulf where indicated on the chart.” (Para. 314.)

The Chamber then analysed the report of the expedition and observed
that it also places “the mouth of the river Goascoran at its present-day
position” (ibid).

The Chamber concluded from the foregoing “that the report of the
1794 expedition and the ‘Carta Esférica’ leave little room for doubt that
the river Goascoran in 1821 was already flowing in its present-day
course” (para. 316).

51. The Judgment rendered by the Chamber in 1992 is thus based
upon certain information conveyed by the “Carta Esférica” and the


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 410

report of the El Activo expedition, in the versions held in Madrid. It
should therefore be determined whether the Chamber might have reached
different conclusions in 1992 had it also had before it the versions of
those documents from Chicago.

52. The Chamber observes in this connection that the two copies of
the “Carta Esférica” held in Madrid and the copy from Chicago differ
only as to certain details, such as, for example, the placing of titles, the
legends, and the handwriting. These differences reflect the conditions
under which documents of this type were prepared in the late eighteenth
century; they afford no basis for questioning the reliability of the charts
that were produced to the Chamber in 1992.

53. The Chamber notes further that the Estero La Cutû and the
mouth of the Rio Goascoran are shown on the copy from Chicago, just
as on the copies from Madrid, at their present-day location, The new
chart produced by El Salvador thus does not overturn the conclusions
arrived at by the Chamber in 1992; it bears them out.

54, As for the new version of the report of the El Aectivo expedition
found in Chicago, it differs from the Madrid version only in terms of cer-
tain details, such as the opening and closing indications, spelling, and
placing of accents. The body of the text is the same, in particular in the
identification of the mouth of the Goascorân. Here again, the new docu-
ment produced by El Salvador bears out the conclusions reached by the
Chamber in 1992,

55. The Chamber concludes from the foregoing that the new facts
alleged by El Salvador in respect of the “Carta Esférica” and the report
of the El Active expedition are not “decisive factors” in respect of the
Judgment whose revision it seeks.

56. Finally, El Salvador contends that proper contextualization of the
alleged new facts “necessitates consideration of other facts that the
Chamber weighed and that are now affected by the new facts”. More-
over, El Salvador claims that

“other evidences and proofs exist that, while not a new fact, were not
taken up in the proceedings and are useful, even essential, whether
to supplement and confirm the sew /acis or to better understand
them”.

It cites the great eruption of Cosigüina volcano and the appearance of
the Farallones del Cosigüina, the Saco negotiations between 1880 and
1884, and the characteristics of the lower reaches of the river Goascoran.

57, Honduras responds that El Salvador, by submitting for the Cham-
ber’s consideration “evidence additional to the alleged new facts”, is act-
ing “as though the Court had to ignore its previous reasoning, on the



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (JUDGMENT) 411

pretext that if is in the light of the context that the existence or non-
existence of the alleged new facts falls to be assessed”. In the view of
Honduras, this approach would be tantamount to expanding “the restrictive
list of elements in Article 61, paragraph |, of the Court's Statute to
unheard-of lengths, calculated to turn revision into a habitual method
of appeal and to undermine the authority of res judicata”.

58. The Chamber agrees with El Salvador’s view that, in order to
determine whether the alleged “new facts” concerning the avulsion of the
Goascoran, the “Carta Esférica” and the report of the EV Activo expedi-
tion fall within the provisions of Article 61 of the Statute, they should be
placed in context, which the Chamber has done in paragraphs 23 to 55
above. However, the Chamber must recall that, under that Article, revi-
sion of a judgment can be opened only by

“the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive fac-
tor, which fact was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the
Court and also to the party claiming revision, always provided that
such ignorance was not due to negligence”,

Thus, the Chamber cannot find admissible an application for revision on
the basis of facts which El Salvador itself does not allege to be new facts
within the meaning of Article 61.

59. Given the conclusions to which it has come in paragraphs 40, 55
and 58 above, it is not necessary for the Chamber to ascertain whether
the other conditions laid down in Article 61 of the Statute are satisfied in
the present case.

60. For these reasons,
THE CHAMBER,
By four votes to one,

Finds that the Application submitted by the Republic of El Salvador
for revision, under Article 61 of the Statute of the Court, of the Judgment
given on 11 September 1992, by the Chamber of the Court formed to deal
with the case concerning the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute
( EI Salvador!Honduras: Nicaragua intervening}, is inadmissible.
