1 While fully subscribing to the Court’s concise reasoning and con-
clusions, I wish to enlarge on my agreement by briefly addressing several
points, some of which are not raised in the Judgment, since the Court
found that there was no new fact and that a ruling on these points, or for
that matter on the other requirements under Article 61 of the Statute of
the Court, would therefore be superfluous

2 Without wishing at this stage to enter into a complex semantic
debate on the notion of “fact” (see in particular the valuable comments
by Mr. S. Torres Bernärdez, former Registrar of the Court, in “A propos
de 'interprétation et de la revision des arrêts de la Cour internationale de
Justice”, Mélanges en l'honneur de R Ago, 1987, Vol Ill, pp 473-478)
and simply proceeding from the basic definition given m all dictionaries,
notably those of public international law, I note that a fact 1s an event
which occurred, which took place at a given point in time. From this
basic, common-sense definition a crucial element stands out the exist-
ence or objective reality of the fact, and hence the Court’s ascertainment
or finding that 1t did indeed happen, or that 1t occurred at an appropriate
time such as to enable 1t to be invoked

3 Now, what can be said of the three “facts” relied upon by Yugosla-
via? To begin with, the physical or objective reality of these three “facts”
1s not immediately apparent, nor has it come to hght later In a manner
of speaking, they are not raw facts whose existence and ascertamment are
1nescapable; rather, they are the product of a process of interpretation



and representation. They are mvoked only as a result of the occurrence of
a separate, subsequent, fact, this one indisputable’ the decision on
1 November 2000 to admit Yugosiavia to the United Nations In other
words, from an established fact occurring in 2000 Yugoslavia infers by
means of an intellectual construct that other “facts” did not exist in 1996
or that they were different m nature But, although appearing logical, this
retrospective intellectual construct proves unfounded, notably 1n relation
to the requirements of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court In reality,
Yugoslavia in 1ts reasoning relies on the admission decision in 2000 to
advance an argument in the form of a syllogism 1n order to be a party to
the Statute of the Court, a State must be a Member of the United
Nations, Yugoslavia was not a Member of the United Nations m 1996,
hence, Yugoslavia was not a party to the Statute of the Court or amen-
able to its jurisdiction However, if the syllogism 1s to hold, each of the
premises must be true, if not, the syllogism 1s mvalid

4 While 1t 1s true that, subject to Article 35 of the Statute, a State
must normally be a Member of the United Nations in order to be a party
to the Statute of the Court, the second premise, that Yugoslavia was not
a Member of the Umted Nations between 1992 and 1996, and the con-
clusion, 1e, that 1t was not amenable to the junsdiction of the Court,
remain to be proved. They beg the question, based as they are on the
mere assumption that Yugoslavia’s admission to the United Nations m
2000 means that it was not a Member before then, notably during the
period between the seisin of the Court and the 1996 Judgment. But this
assertion, arrived at by highly abstract reasoning on the basis of an argu-
mentum a contrario, actually obscures the facts, namely the complexities
and uncertainties affecting Yugoslavia’s status during that period, as wit-
nessed not only by the debates before the various United Nations organs,
the statements by the Umited Nations Under-Secretary-General and the
position of the Court, but also and above all by the conduct of Yugosla-
via 1tself

5 After having long interpreted these complexities and uncertainties
as not precluding 1t from being a Member of the United Nations, Yugo-
slavia reinterprets and re-characterizes them, for purposes of its Applica-
tion mn 2001, as factors disproving its membership 1n the United Nations
But the facts are the same and, while still ambiguous, and therefore open
to conflicting interpretations, they are unchanged It has only been Yugo-
stavia’s mtellectual representation of the facts and 1ts position which have
changed, a change made with a view to seeking revision of the Judgment
of 11 July 1996 Since the facts remain the same, it 1s clearly difficult to
discern any new facts justifying an application for revision A new rep-
resentation of the same reality does not transform 1t into a new fact As

29 July 1927 in the Baron de Neuflize case


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (SEP OP MAHIOU) 72

“revision 1s not warranted by criticism of a legal doctrine or by
a different assessment of the facts, or even by both, but solely by a
lack of information concerning the facts” (Recueil des décisions des
tribunaux arbitraux mixtes, VII, p 632)

6 Moreover, assuming that the hypothetical “facts” resulting from
ference and a new representation match the reality, are they “new”
within the meaning of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court? Although 1t
cites three “new facts”, Yugoslavia’s Application in effect 1s based essen-
tially on a single, purportedly “new”, “fact”, inferred a contrario from its
admission to the United Nations on 1 November 2000 namely, that 1t
did not belong to the United Nations at the time of the Judgment Thus,
it would appear, 1s the only “fact” — from which the other two are
claimed to follow — that could serve as the basis for an application for
revision Assuming further, as a working hypothesis, that this construct,
which infers from a fact occurring in 2000 the existence — or rather non-
existence — of a different fact in 1996, 1s accepted, was the discovery or
awareness of 1t new? Ultimately, that 1s the question 1t 1s not the fact
itself which 1s inherently or objectively new, 1t 1s the knowledge of that
fact which must be new to the party relying upon 1t or to the Court which
handed down the Judgment Is that the case here?

8 The debate was taken up in the Security Council and the General
Assembly, both of which refused to recognize automatic continuity,
required an application for membership and suspended Yugoslavia’s par-
ticipation in the work of the General Assembly That was when the prob-
lem of membership in the United Nations entered a grey area, being
susceptible of clear resolution, as was confirmed by the Under-Secre-
tary-General’s letter of 29 September 1992 All the vanous positions
taken, whatever their legal status and whatever actual or potential self-
contradictions they might contain, are clear evidence not only that this
fact 1s not new but that it had been of concern to Yugoslavia, to the other
States resulting from its break-up and to the international community,

mcluding the United Nations The United Nations put an end to one
uncertainty when Yugoslavia finally decided to apply for membership as
from 1 November 2000, Yugoslavia has effectively been a Member of the
United Nations That 1s beyond doubt and clarifies one problem for the
future but 1t does not resolve, and does not retroactively undo, the prior
situation, namely the differences of opinion concerning Yugosiavia’s
status vis-à-vis the United Nations before its admission on 1 November
2000 True, the “complexity”, “difficulties” or “inconsistencies” of the
situation which was created at the time and persisted may be regrettable,
but that situation did exist, and that remains the case today

9. Thus, between 1992 and 1996 the fact was perfectly well known to
everyone, particularly to the party relying on 1t today, even though there
may have been great uncertainty as to the exact solution to be applied to
the problem raised. In any event, there were enough substantial, trouble-
some indices to alert Yugoslavia and to prompt it to reflect upon its posi-
tion vis-a-vis the United Nations Under other circumstances, more
favourable indeed to the Applicant in some respects, the Court has not
hesitated to reject the contention that the fact relied upon was unknown
and to draw inferences from the lack, or insufficiency, of diligence in
becoming aware of the fact Thus, in the Fisheries case, in which the
United Kingdom contended that 1t was unaware of an 186$ Norwegian
Decree concerning the delimitation of the territorial sea, the Court stated
“as a maritime Power traditionally concerned with the law of the sea and
concerned particularly to defend the freedom of the seas, the United
Kingdom could not have been ignorant of the Decree of 1869” (I CJ
Reports 1951, p 139) In another case, that concerning Application for
Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of 24 February 1982 in the
Case concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)
(Tunisia v Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), the Court was critical of Tunisia
for having failed, mn respect of the delimitation of a Libyan concession, to
seek “to know the co-ordinates of the Concession, so as to establish the
precise extent of the encroachment on what it regarded as Tunisian con-
tinental shelf” (7 CJ Reports 1985, p 205, para 24) Yet in the present
case not only was the debate as to whether or not Yugoslavia was a
Member of the United Nations no secret to anyone, 1t lay at the heart of
international debate, engendering an uncertainty which at that time
could only lead to further debate regarding Yugoslavia’s international
relations, including its status vis-a-vis the Statute of the Court and the
Genocide Convention This is unlike the situation cited in the United
States-Mexico claim in the Shreck case, where an arbitral award had
been founded on the erroneous assumption that the claimant was a
United States citizen when he was mn fact a citizen of Mexico, the discov-
ery of the true nationality was a new fact which had been unknown to the
tribunal and which justified the request for reconsideration (see J B
Moore, History and Digest of the International Arbitrations to which the


APPLICATION FOR REVISION (SEP OP MAHIOU) 74

United States has been Party, 1898, Vol II, p 1357) The position here 1s
different, more like that of the United Kingdom or Tunisia, Yugoslavia
should have given more serious consideration during the proceedings to
its conduct and, in particular, should have looked to the Court, at the
appropriate time and in a more justifiable way, for a solution to the prob-
lem.

16 If the problem was thus clearly known to the party now seeking
revision, it was in consequence also clear to the Court, once the Court
had been cailed upon to rule on the request for the indication of provi-
sional measures for purposes of its Order of 8 April 1993 Without at the
time making an issue of this point, Yugoslavia admits — as 1s moreover
recalled in 1ts Application instituting proceedings — the “complexities”
and “controversies” characterizing its position vis-à-vis the United
Nations, nor did these escape the Court In adjudicating upon its juris-
diction and the admissibility of the Application, the Court was aware of
all the potential 1ssues of fact and law, but 1t considered 1t unnecessary mn
the circumstances, in order to make its ruling, to address the issue of
Yugoslavia’s status One of the recitals in the Court’s Order 1s particu-
larly revealing in this regard

“Whereas, while the solution adopted 1s not free from legal diffi-
culties, the question whether or not Yugoslavia is a Member of the
United Nations and as such a party to the Statute of the Court 1s
one which the Court does not need to determine defimtively at the
present stage of the proceedings” (Application of the Convention on
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosna
and Herzegovina v Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)), Provi-
sional Measures, Order of 8 April 1993, I CJ Reports 1993, p 14,
para 18)

11 If the Court, in its subsequent consideration of the case, was not
required, and rightly so, to concern itself with the 1ssue of membership mn
the United Nations, that was not only because Yugoslavia did not ask 1t
to do so but also because Yugoslavia persisted in 1ts position, maintain-
mg the “uncertainties and dilemmas” (see Yugoslavia’s Application of
24 April 2001, p 16), the “[clontroversies and dilemmas” (ibid, p 20),
the “mixed signals” (bd, p 24) and the “complexities and dilemmas”
(ibid , p 26) to which 1t makes repeated reference in its Application for
revision

12 Further, even after filing the Application for revision of the Judg-
ment of 11 July 1996, Yugoslavia remained just as equivocal and self-
contradictory in its conduct, for, at the same time as 1t was denying the
Court’s jurisdiction and clainung not to be bound by the Genocide Con-
vention, 1t was, and still 1s, the Applicant in other cases before the Court
Thus, in submitting and justifying the Applications of 29 April 1999
against ten NATO members (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United



APPLICATION FOR REVISION (SEP OP MAHIOU) 75

States of America) in the cases concerning Legality of Use of Force,
Yugoslavia invokes the same bases of jurisdiction as those relied on by
the Court mn 1ts 1996 Judgment, namely Yugoslavia’s declaration recog-
nizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court and Article IX of the
Genocide Convention, and it was on those same bases that the Court
made 1ts Orders of 2 June 1999 on the requests for the indication of pro-
visional measures Eight of these ten cases are still pending before the
Court, while the other two Applications, against Spain and the Umted
States, were dismissed on account of the specific reservations to the
Genocide Convention made by those two States

13 Moreover, the scope and length of the debate over Yugoslavia’s
membership in the Umted Nations show that everyone was aware of this
fact, even though views differed, as noted above, as to the exact way mn
which the problem should be resolved. These differences of opinion are
the very evidence which makes 1t impossible to speak of a fact that was
“new” and unknown to the party seeking revision and to the Court,
which referred to it in its Order of 8 April 1993 and rendered 1ts 1996
Judgment in full awareness of it, but without addressing it, because it had
not been requested to do so and 1t was unnecessary for 1t to do so

14 In conclusion, without there being any need to raise the issue of
forum prorogatum already debated in connection with the additional
requests for the indication of provisional measures mn 1993 (see in par-
ticular the separate opimon of Judge ad hoc Lauterpacht, I CJ Reports
1993, pp 416-421) and with the prelimmary objections in 1996, 1t 1s
apparent that there 1s no new fact but simply a new presentation or char-
acterization of the same reality by Yugoslavia, whose conduct has changed
for the better — at which all should rejoice — without however effacing
its earlier misconduct Even though the question of its status was pending
before the United Nations throughout the duration of the proceedings
before the Court, not only did Yugoslavia fail to seek ways and means to
clarify the situation but it has contmued to mamta the uncertainty, pro-
longing 1t up to the present day, as stated in paragraph 12 above Today’s
authorities in Yugoslavia were not the source of the misconduct, which 1s
attributable to therr predecessors, but that changes nothing in terms of
responsibility, for the fault 1s one attributable to the State concerned,
notwithstanding that there has been a change of régime and the begin-
nings of a change 1n legal policy
