In the operative provision of its Judgment the Court has found
“that it cannot adjudicate upon the merits of the claim of the
Federal Republic of Cameroon”. I have felt able to subscribe to such
an operative provision but cannot accept the reasons on which the
Court bases its Judgment. These reasons consist in essence of a
finding that the decision requested by Cameroon would be without
object.

I cannot subscribe to such a statement and consider, on the
contrary, that, as I shall explain in the first part of this separate
opinion, Cameroon’s claim is fully admissible. In my view the
reason why it is not possible to examine the merits of the claim is
quite other and lies in the lack of jurisdiction. The second part of
this separate opinion will in fact be devoted to the question of
jurisdiction. This question, which was not dealt with by the Court
and which, having regard to the Court’s approach, it had no reason
to deal with, cannot be avoided once the claim is deemed, as it is
in my view, to be admissible,

1. The United Kingdom's preliminary objections raised, infer
alia, two questions which, in my opinion, are closely interconnected.

The first of these questions relatés to the nature of the claim,
that is to say the content and’ characteristics of the decision re-
quested of the Court. There was discussion of whether such a
decision would be a judgment with force of res judicata or rather a
mere advisory opinion; and the question of the declaratory nature
of any judgment which might be given by the Court was also raised.

The other question raised by the United Kingdom relates to
whether there is a dispute between the United Kingdom and
Cameroon.

In raising this question the United Kingdom made numerous
references in its Counter-Memorial to Article 1g of the Trusteeship
Agreement in order to deny the existence of a dispute with the
features required by that Article. It would however seem that from
the beginning it was the United Kingdom's intention to deny in
general the existence of any dispute between it and Cameroon.
The argument of the non-existence of any dispute was subsequently
put forward very clearly on several occasions in the oral arguments
and it is the subject of the first of the United Kingdom's final
submissions.



In any case this is a question which could be raised by the Court
proprio motu, because of the conclusions to be drawn from a negative
answer on the basis of the Statute and the Rules of Court, and thus
quite apart from Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement. For
according to the Statute and Rules of Court the Court can perform
its function in contentious proceedings by giving a decision on the
merits only on condition that there really is a dispute between the
parties. This is a question connected not with the Court’s juris-
diction but rather with the admissibility of the claim; it is a question
which comes before any question of jurisdiction.

2. As I have already said, the two questions just referred to, one
relating to the nature of the claim and the other to the existence
of the dispute, are closely interconnected. It might even be said
that there is only a single question: whether or not there is a dispute.

If there is no dispute, it becomes unnecessary to consider what is
the content of the decision requested of the Court and what the
characteristics of such a decision would be, with a view to making
the possibility of giving the decision and hence the admissibility of
the claim depend on the content and characteristics of the decision
requested. For the non-existence of a dispute is in itself a bar to
the delivery of any judgment on the merits, because in such a case
any judgment would be without object. It is for that reason that
the claim would have to be declared inadmissible.

If on the contrary it is considered that there is a dispute (and in
its Judgment the Court has found that there is) it would be im-
possible to deny that it could be settled by judicial means (subject
of course to the question of whether or not the Court has jurisdiction
in connection with that particular dispute). It is likewise un-
necessary on this hypothesis to consider, in connection with the
admissibility of the claim, what the characteristics and content of
the decision would be. The characteristics and content of the de-
cision could not but be related to the characteristics of the dispute.
In the present case, precisely because of the particular character-
istics of the dispute (on the assumption that a dispute exists)
the judgment could only be purely declaratory. But in the inter-
national field there can be no doubt about the possibility of purely
declaratory judgments.

3. Once it has been established that there is a dispute, there is no
point, in my view, in raising the question of whether the Applicant
has an interest, by reference to the principle recognized in certain
municipal legal systems according to which it is necessary to have
an interest in order to have a right of action.

It should be observed that the interest on which a right of action
depends in municipal law is not a substantive interest in connection
with the actual merits of the dispute. It is on the contrary an
interest of a purely procedural nature: an interest in obtaining a

IZI

decision on the merits. In the legal systems to which I have referred
this type of interest has a very important role; it is indeed a con-
dition for an action. This is very readily explicable if it is borne in
mind that in general such systems make no use of the concept of
dispute.

It is on the contrary on the concept of dispute that international
proceedings and, in particular, proceedings before the Court, are
based. This Court cannot exercise its function in contentious
proceedings if a dispute does not exist between the parties. Clearly
a dispute implies a reference to a (real or at least supposed) conflict
of interests and hence to substantive interests possessed by the
parties. But it has already been observed that substantive interest
is something other than the procedural interest which is required by
municipal law in order to have a right of action. This latter interest
is an interest in securing a decision on the merits. In the case of an
international dispute, if such a dispute exists (and it has already
been said that the existence of a dispute constitutes in itself a
condition on which the possibility of a decision on the merits
depends) it is clear that in any case each party has an interest in the
settlement of the dispute. The interest in securing a decision on the
merits is 1m re ipsa, because it is a necessary consequence of the
very existence of a dispute. It is thus apparent that the concept
of interest in bringing an action has no place of its own in the
field of international proceedings.

4. In my opinion a dispute consists of a clash between the
respective attitudes of the parties with regard to a certain conflict
of interests. Thus the dispute may result from a claim by one of
the parties followed either by the denial of that claim by the other
party or by a course of conduct by the other party contrary to the
claim. But there may also be a dispute resulting first of all from
a course of conduct by one of the parties against which the other

or circumstances which no doubt pre-date 1 January 1960: for
example, the fact that, two years after the establishment of the
Trusteeship System, there had allegedly been no change in the
British zone in the practice instituted at the time of the creation
of the Mandate; the constitutional and administrative reforms
which occurred in 1949, in 1951, in 1954 and in 1957 within the
framework of Nigerian institutions; the non-existence until 1959
of political parties other than Nigerian; indirect suffrage by show
of hands and for men only until 1959. But if regard is had to the
complaints listed in the statement of the law in the Application
and on which Cameroon asks the Court to pronounce, it is apparent
that none of them relates to conduct on the part of the United
Kingdom which may be regarded as wholly prior to 1 January 1960.
The first five points relate to conduct by the United Kingdom
which although begun before 1 January 1960, continued after that
date, at least in the form of omissions. The last two points, con-
cerning the February 1961 plebiscite, relate solely to conduct
subsequent to 1 January 1960.

6. Consideration will now be given to the question of whether
there was on the part of Cameroon a protest against the conduct
adopted by the United Kingdom after 1 January 1960, that is
to say an assertion that the conduct of the United Kingdom was
detrimental to an interest which was Cameroon’s own interest.
