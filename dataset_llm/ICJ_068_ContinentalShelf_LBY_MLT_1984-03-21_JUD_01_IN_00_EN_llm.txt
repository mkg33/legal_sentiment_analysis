Court for permission to intervene in the case is based on Article 62 of the
Statute of the Court, which provides :

“1. Should a State consider that it has an interest of a legal nature
which may be affected by the decision in the case, it may submit a
request to the Court to be permitted to intervene.

2. It shall be for the Court to decide upon this request.”

Such an application under Article 62 is required by Article 81, paragraph 1,
of the Rules of Court to be filed “as soon as possible, and not later than the



closure of the written proceedings”, and by Article 81, paragraph 2, to
specify the case to which it relates and to set out :

“(a) the interest of a legal nature which the State applying to inter-
vene considers may be affected by the decision in that case ;
(b) the precise object of the intervention ;
(c) any basis of jurisdiction which is claimed to exist as between the
State applying to intervene and the parties to the case.”

The Application of Italy was filed in the Registry of the Court only two
days before the time-limit fixed for the filing of the Parties’ Counter-
Memorials. This fact has been emphasized by counsel for Libya in the
context of a contention that Italy’s legal or procedural position has been
affected by delay. The Court notes however that the Application was filed
before the expiry of the time-limit fixed by Article 81, paragraph 1, of the
Rules. The substantive objections taken by the Parties in connection with
(inter alia) the date of filing of the Application to intervene, in the context
of these proceedings, need not be examined at this stage in the Judgment
when the Court is concerned only with formal admissibility. So far as the
three requirements set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article 81,
paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court are concerned, the Court notes that the
Italian Application complies formally with these, even though objection
has been taken by the Parties on the basis that, on the substance, in all three
respects there are grounds for finding the Application of Italy inadmissi-
ble. The Court concludes that the Italian application is not out of time and
has no formal defect which would render it inadmissible.

11. Certain questions have been raised as to the jurisdiction of the Court
in relation to the Italian Application, inasmuch as it has been objected
both by Libya and by Malta that Italy has not shown, and cannot show, the
existence of “any basis of jurisdiction which is claimed to exist as between
the State applying to intervene and the Parties to the case”. It has not
however been suggested by either of these States that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to entertain the present Application, and to determine its
admissibility : on the contrary, it is admitted that such jurisdiction is
conferred on the Court by Article 62 of the Statute, a view which is shared
by the Court itself. The contention of Libya and Malta is rather that the
absence of what the Court in 1981 called “a valid link of jurisdiction with
the parties to the case” (/.C.J. Reports 1981, p. 20, para. 36), constitutes a
ground on which the Application of Italy for permission to intervene must
be refused, or found to be inadmissible. Accordingly, although this ques-
tion is one of the Court’s jurisdiction, it has no priority of the kind which
attaches to a jurisdictional objection stricto sensu, and need not be exam-
ined in advance of the other contentions put forward by the Parties either
as objections to the admissibility of the Application, or as grounds for
refusing it.

12. Before proceeding further, the Court would emphasize, as it did in
the Judgment of 14 April 1981 on the application of Malta to intervene in
the Continental Shelf case between Tunisia and Libya, that



“it does not consider paragraph 2 [of Article 62 of the Statute] to
confer upon it any general discretion to accept or reject a request for
permission to intervene for reasons simply of policy. On the contrary,
in the view of the Court the task entrusted to it by that paragraph is to
determine the admissibility or otherwise of the request by reference to
the relevant provisions of the Statute.” (I.C.J. Reports 1981, p. 12,
para. 17.)

The Court will therefore now examine the contentions advanced by Italy in
support of its application for permission to intervene, and the objections
taken by the Parties to the admissibility of the Italian Application, in the
light of the relevant provisions of the Statute.

13. Article 62 of the Statute begins by setting the condition that “should
a State consider that it has an interest of a legal nature which may be’
affected by the decision in the case . ..”. Taken literally, this is no more
than an indication of the reasons which may impel a State to seek to
intervene but it is clear that the intention of the text is that the existence of
such an interest is, objectively, a requirement for intervention. As the
Court stated in its Judgment of 14 April 1981, what a State seeking to
intervene

“has to show in order to obtain permission to intervene under Article
62 of the Statute is an interest of a legal nature which may be affected
by the Court’s decision in the present case” (I. C.J. Reports 1981, p. 19,
para. 33).

14. In order to assess the interest of a legal nature claimed by Italy
and to appreciate in what way Italy considers that its interest is en cause,
or may be affected by the decision in the present case, it is necessary to
recall the subject-matter of the case as defined by the Special Agreement
concluded by the Parties on 23 May 1976 and notified to the Court on
26 July 1982. Articles I and IIT of that Special Agreement provide as
follows :

“Article I
The Court is requested to decide the following question :

What principles and rules of international law are applicable to the
delimitation of the area of the continental shelf which appertains to
the Republic of Malta and the area of continental shelf which apper-
tains to the Libyan Arab Republic, and how in practice such princi-
ples and rules can be applied by the two Parties in this particular case
in order that they may without difficulty delimit such areas by an
agreement as provided in Article IIL.



Article III

Following the final decision of the International Court of Justice
the Government of the Republic of Malta and the Government of the
Libyan Arab Republic shall enter into negotiations for determining
the area of their respective continental shelves and for concluding an
agreement for that purpose in accordance with the decision of the
Court.”

No express indication is given in the Special Agreement which would in
any way limit the area in which the delimitation referred to in Article I is to
be effected, and reference is there made to delimitation of “the area of the
continental shelf which appertains to” Malta and to the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya respectively, without saying in which direction it extends or
indicating the identity of the State whose shelf might border on it. It is clear
however from, in particular, the reference in Article ITI to a delimitation
agreement to be concluded between Malta and Libya “in accordance with
the decision of the Court” that the Court’s task is confined to indication of
the principles and rules of international law applicable to the delimitation
to be effected between those two States, and how in practice they can be
applied. Furthermore, it is a fundamental principle that the Court has no
jurisdiction to determine matters in dispute between States without their
consent. Thus the content of the future decision by the Court in the case
brought before it by the Libya/Malta Special Agreement of 23 May 1976
cannot determine the delimitation of the respective continental shelves
appertaining to those States vis-a-vis any third State.

15. The interest of a legal nature contemplated by the Statute has been
defined in the present case by counsel for Italy as “an interest of the
Applicant State covered vis-à-vis other States, namely the principal Par-
ties, by international legal rules or principles”. The specific legal interest
relied on by Italy is claimed to be “nothing less than respect for its
sovereign rights over certain areas of continental shelf in issue in the
present case”. Briefly expressed, the contention of Italy is that, so far as it is
acquainted with the claims of Libya and Malta to areas of continental shelf
in the central Mediterranean, it is of the view that those claims extend to
areas which would be found to appertain to Italy if a delimitation were to
be effected between Italy and Libya, and between Italy and Malta, on the
basis of international law. At the hearing counsel for Italy demonstrated
on a map of the central Mediterranean what were understood by Italy to be
the claims of the Parties to continental shelf areas, and indicated broadly
where Italy considered that it had rights in such areas. In response to a
question put by a judge, the Agent of Italy, in a written reply enclosed
with a letter dated 6 February 1984 (to which was attached a map) indi-
cated

“the zones of continental shelf over which Italy considers that 1t has
rights and which are comprised within the region which is probably



the subject-matter of the case pending before the International Court
of Justice”.

The legal interest of Italy is thus not merely an interest, but the “sovereign
rights” over the appropriate areas of continental shelf for the purpose of
exploration and exploitation recognized by customary law and explicitly
mentioned in the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and
the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. “The interest
relied upon by Italy”, said counsel at the hearing, “is the protection of its
claims to its sovereign rights over areas claimed by the Parties to the
present case”. Furthermore, its interests are involved inasmuch as it has
reservations as to what it understands to be the views of Libya on such
matters as the status of a considerable part of the Gulf of Sirt.

16. In its Application for permission to intervene, and in the arguments
of its counsel before the Court, Italy gives the following indications of the
way in which it considers that its interest of a legal nature is en cause, or
may be affected by the decision in the present case. The areas of conti-
nental shelf to be delimited between the Parties all belong to one and the
same region of the central Mediterranean, of which Italy is a coastal State,
and in which, consequently, some of the continental shelf areas over which
it considers it possesses rights are situated. The whole bed of the sea area in
question is part of the continental shelf, within the meaning of the defi-
nition in Article 76 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea, and the greater part of such sea-bed consists of areas of overlap of
the rights of such States. Some of the areas of continental shelf disputed
between Malta and Libya in the present proceedings are areas over which
Italy considers that it has undeniable rights. In the light of a comparison of
the Special Agreement by which the Court was seised in the present case
with that concluded in 1977 by Tunisia and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
on the basis of which the Court gave its Judgment of 24 February 1982,
Italy expects that the future judgment of the Court in the present case will
be as precise as that previous Judgment and will necessarily exclude any
uncertainty with regard to the location and size of the continental shelf
belonging to each of the Parties as a consequence of the establishment
of the demarcation line. The Court’s future judgment, it is suggested,
will therefore inevitably decide, albeit implicitly, namely by delimiting
between States other than Italy, that given areas do not appertain to
Italy.

17. In accordance with Article 81, paragraph 2 (b), of the Rules of
Court, the Application of Italy contains a statement of the “precise object”
of the intervention. Italy explains first that :

“The object of the intervention which Italy seeks authorization to
make directly follows both from the definition of its legal interest
which may be affected, and from the very object of the case which has
been brought before the Court.”



The Application goes on to indicate that: “The object of Italy’s application
to intervene is to ensure the defence before the Court of its interest of a
legal nature”, so that the principles and rules of international law to be
determined by the Court as applicable to the delimitation of the conti-
nental shelf between Malta and Libya “and, in particular, the practical
method of applying them, are not determined by the Court without
awareness of that interest, and to its prejudice”, and continues :

“In other words, Italy seeks to participate in the proceedings to the
full extent necessary to enable it to defend the rights which it claims
over some of the areas-claimed by the Parties, and to specify the
position of those areas, taking into account the claims of the two
principal Parties and the arguments put forward in support of those
claims, so that the Court may be as fully informed as possible as to the
nature and scope of the rights of Italy in the areas of continental shelf
concerned by the delimitation, and may thus be in a position to take
due account of those rights in its decision.”

During the oral proceedings, a co-Agent for Italy offered a further sum-
mary of the object of the intervention. Italy, he said, is not requesting the
Court to determine the course of the delimitation line dividing the areas of
continental shelf appertaining to Italy from the areas appertaining respec-
tively to Malta or Libya, nor to determine the principles and rules of
international law applicable to that delimitation.

“Italy is asking the Court, when it accomplishes the mission
entrusted to it by the Special Agreement of 23 May 1976, that is to say,
when it answers the questions put to it in Article I of that Special
Agreement, to take into consideration the interests of a legal nature
which Italy possesses in relation to various areas claimed by the main
Parties, on certain parts of those areas, and accordingly to provide the
two Parties with every needful indication to ensure that they do not,
when they conclude their delimitation agreement pursuant to the
Court’s judgment, include any areas which, on account of the exis-
tence of rights possessed by Italy, ought to be the subject either of
delimitation between Italy and Malta, or of delimitation between
Italy and Libya, or of a delimitation agreement as between all three
countries.”

At a later stage, counsel emphasized that Italy is not seeking to intervene
solely to inform the Court of its claims, but so that the Court can give the
Parties all the requisite guidance to ensure non-encroachment on areas
over which Italy has rights. The object of the Italian intervention is thus
claimed to be “strictly within the framework of the case brought before the
Court by the 1976 Special Agreement”, and in no way to affect the interests
of the main Parties. Another aspect of its intervention emphasized by Italy
is that



“the Government of Italy, once permitted to intervene, will submit to
such decision as the Court may make with regard to the rights claimed
by Italy, in full conformity with the terms of Article 59 of the Statute
of the Court”.

Its status in such circumstances would, it was suggested, be that of an
“intervening party”, entitled to make submissions.

18. The Court has noted above the formal compliance by Italy in its
Application with the requirement of paragraph 2 (c) of Article 81 of the
Rules of Court, requiring the applicant State to set out “any basis of
jurisdiction which is claimed to exist” as between itself and the parties to
the case. Italy’s contention is that

“the Italian legal interest which may certainly be affected . . . and the
object of the present application . . . are automatically, and in accor-
dance with the Statute of the Court, creative of jurisdiction of the
Court to the extent necessary to justify the admission of Italy to
participate in the present proceedings as an intervener”.

This indication is however prefaced by the observation that “there is no
provision in Article 62 of the Statute that the existence of a basis of
Jurisdiction is a condition for intervention”, and that Article 81, paragraph
2 (c), was not intended to impose such a condition but “does no more than
lay down a mere requirement for information to be supplied with a view to
fuller knowledge of the circumstances of the case”. Italy argues that every
State party to the Statute is ipso facto made subject to the “jurisdictions
which are directly established by the Statute”, including the direct juris-
diction created by Article 62. Provided the conditions laid down by that
Article are fulfilled,

“Italy considers that the operation of Article 62 itself suffices to create
the basis of jurisdiction of the Court to the extent necessary for the
admission of an application for permission to intervene”.

Accordingly, while mentioning its being a party to the European Conven-
tion for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes, in order — as counsel later
explained — “to satisfy the procedural obligations arising out of Article 81
of the Rules of Court”, Italy has throughout maintained its view that
Article 62 of the Statute afforded a sufficient basis of jurisdiction, either in
itself or by the conjunction of the acceptance of the jurisdictional power of
the Court by becoming a party to the Court’s Statute, with a subsequent
conferral of jurisdiction on it, for example by Special Agreement. This view
it qualifies only to the extent of recognizing that it might be valid only for a
“genuine intervention”, one bearing exclusively on the subject-matter of
the main case, and not concerning an independent dispute. Should the
intervention, or purported intervention, be one in which the applicant
seeks to assert a right against the parties, and thus equivalent to a mainline
application, in such case either it would not be a genuine intervention at all,
or



“the general title of jurisdiction constituted by Article 62 should be
supplemented by a special jurisdictional link between the State seek-
ing to intervene and the Parties to the case, by virtue of an interpre-
tation reading Article 62 with Article 36, and taking into account the
optional character of the Court’s jurisdiction”.

* *

19. In its Observations on the Application of Italy, Libya first raises
certain preliminary issues. Noting that there had been no negotiation, prior
to that application, between Libya and Italy confirming the delimitation of
their continental shelf and no dispute upon that subject had arisen, it
observes that since the Italian claims were asserted for the first time in the
application for permission to intervene, their validity was seriously open to
challenge. To allow Italy to intervene at this late stage in the proceedings
would create an unfair situation by placing Italy in an advantageous
position vis-a-vis the main Parties, already committed as they were by the
contents of their pleadings. During the oral proceedings, Libya contended
that the absence of prior negotiations was abnormal in the case of a
problem — the delimitation of the continental shelf — for whose solution
international law prescribed agreement as the primary method, whereas it
is only in the absence of such agreement that the States concerned should
turn to procedures of pacific settlement. International practice accords
with that principle, it observes, and Italy has itself concluded several
delimitation agreements. But it has not entered into any negotiations with
Libya with a view either to delimitation or to the conclusion of a special
agreement for the institution of proceedings. Now Italy is seeking to make
use of intervention procedure ; but it is doing so by means of an appli-
cation filed at so late a stage that, even if it was not in breach of Article 81, it
runs counter to the tendency expressed by that Article in the 1978 Rules of
Court.

20. Libya further denies that Italy has been able to establish the exis-
tence of any Italian interest of a legal nature which could be affected by the
decision in the case. In its Observations it urges that the claims disclosed by
the Italian Application remain so vague that they could not properly be the
subject of an intervention ; Italy’s interest is neither defined nor localized.
Furthermore, the 1976 Special Agreement does not in any way put in issue
the rights of Italy but only rights and claims as between Libya and Malta.
The Italian position could not be justified by any reference to “procedural
law”, since there is no precedent for permission to intervene in the Court’s
practice, and any analogy with municipal law would be misleading, since
that law is based on compulsory jurisdiction. During the oral proceedings,
Libya explained further that the Application “does not in fact take the
Special Agreement of 23 May 1976 properly into consideration”. The
Italian argument based on similarity with the 1977 Tunisia/ Libya Special
Agreement (referred to in paragraph 16 above), was unsound particularly
since the Libya/Malta agreement of 1976 left the Parties a margin for



negotiations leading to a treaty, whereas the 1977 text simply provided for
experts to apply the decision of the Court. Italy failed to recognize the
strictly bilateral character of the delimitation to be effected. That character
is more strictly denoted in the 1976 Special Agreement than in that of 1977.
The relativity of delimitations stands confirmed in judicial and arbitral
case-law. This constitutes both a necessity, in that bilateral delimitations
have to be settled one by one, and a guarantee for third States. Further-
more, in the case of a decision by the Court, Italy’s rights would be
safeguarded by the application of Article 59 of its Statute. Thus the rights
of third States would be protected by the constant attitude of the Court,
without it being necessary to have recourse to intervention.

21. With regard to the object of the intervention, which according to
Libya Italy had not been able to describe precisely, Libya refers in its
Observations to Italy’s statement of that object (quoted or summarized in
paragraph 17 above), and contends that those declarations were so vague
that they should induce the Court to adopt in their respect the same
negative position as it had taken with regard to the Application of Malta
for permission to intervene in the case between Tunisia and Libya. In any
event, as the Court’s Judgment on the dispute between Libya and Malta
could not prejudice any Italian legal interest, the sole real object which the
Italian Application could have was, in Libya’s view, to make the Court
aware of Italy’s interest. But if that were so the Italian Application was not
one in respect of which permission to intervene should be granted under
Article 62 of the Statute. If, on the other hand, Italy really wishes to submit
its claims against Libya (or Malta) to adjudication, the appropriate pro-
cedure should be negotiations between Italy and Libya or Malta, not that
of an intervention, which would widen the scope and disrupt the de-
velopment of the case already referred to the Court.

22. During the oral proceedings Italy did, Libya conceded, furnish
certain indications regarding the object of its Application. These, however,
had not removed all ambiguity. It remained unclear whether Italy pro-
posed to defend its rights by merely supplying the Court with information
or whether it intended to put in issue its own claims to certain areas. The
purpose of merely informing the Court would not justify an intervention,
while if, on the other hand, Italy sought to assert its rights against Libya or
Malta as a party to the case, that could not be regarded as an intervention
but would be an entirely new case. Moreover, the indications provided by
Italy served to demonstrate that the Court could properly discharge its task
without the admission of Italy to intervene. By the effect of Article 59 of
the Statute, the Court’s judgment would be binding only upon the Parties
but would be relative and non-opposable to Italy ; that State would in no
way be bound by the operative provisions of that judgment. Italy would be
protected by the relative effect of judicial decisions, the fact that delimi-
tation agreements are always concluded subject to the rights of third States
and, finally, the fact that the Special Agreement of 1976 did not place any
rights in issue except as between Libya and Malta.

23. Inits Observations Libya also contends that the Italian Application



should be dismissed on account of the requirements imposed by the Statute
and the Rules of Court in regard to jurisdiction. The sole possible basis of
the Court’s competence is the common and mutual consent of the States
involved. But there was not even a prima facie link of jurisdiction between
Libya and Italy. Article 62 in itself could not constitute such a link. If the
Italian contentions were accepted, the provision of the Rules of Court
concerning the basis of jurisdiction, which implies that Article 62 cannot
create in itself that basis, would be meaningless. During the oral proceed-
ings, Libya further observed that the fact that Italy had expressed its
intention of becoming a party and requesting a judgment in its favour was
highly relevant in determining whether the Court had jurisdiction. That
jurisdiction flowed from a dual consent, made up of accession to the
Statute and subsequent acceptance of a basis of jurisdiction. There could
be no presumption of such acceptance and, whatever its form, it must be
clearly and distinctly expressed. That basis of jurisdiction was not pro-
vided by Article 62. This conclusion could be drawn from the location of
this Article within the Statute, from Article 81, paragraph 2 (c), of the Rules
of Court (which, while unable to derogate from the Statute, provided an
authoritative interpretation thereof, and at the least signified that the
question of jurisdiction could be relevant or even decisive), by the author-
ity of jurists of unimpeachable competence, including several judges of the
Court, and, finally, by the respect owed to the principles of reciprocity and
equality between States. Those principles would be violated if intervention
was made exempt from the requirement of a common and mutual consent
of the three States, since the initial Parties would be constrained to submit
themselves to the Court’s jurisdiction to a degree exceeding the corre-
sponding obligations of the intervener, which would enjoy a right not
possessed by the original Parties.

24. Libya also disputed each of the Italian arguments regarding the
interpretation of Article 62. It argued that once the decision had been
taken to subject the Court’s jurisdiction to the consent of States, the
draftsmen of the Statute would have said so in terms had they wished to
exclude the case of intervention from that decision. All that Article 62
conferred upon the Court was an incidental jurisdiction, one quite distinct
from jurisdiction for dealing with matters of substance ; otherwise, that
Article would automatically and covertly institute a form of compulsory
jurisdiction, all possibility of reservations to which would be excluded. The
Italian contention that States referring a dispute to the Court by means of a
special agreement accept the provisions of the Statute authorizing the
intervention of any State substantiating a legal interest would be correct
only if such a derogation from the principle of the equality of States had a
clear and express legal basis, which it had not. Even supposing such
implicit consent to be conceivable, it should at least relate to a specific
pre-existing dispute, which is not the case here. The Special Agreement
could not serve as an implicit basis for the Italian intervention, which
would virtually involve its revision.

* *



25. Malta contends that Italy’s application “relates to a claim which
Italy has never before formulated”. According to Malta, its discussions
with Italy since 1965 have concerned only the areas of continental shelf
between Malta and Sicily, or Malta and the Pelagian Islands, and have not
concerned the areas to which it has in its Application indicated claims.
Malta has further pointed out that, whereas in 1981 it had had occasion
publicly to expound its own claims when presenting its own application for
permission to intervene, Italy did not, either then or later, give utterance to
any conflicting claims. In particular, Malta maintains that Italy has never
made “reference to any claim to any continental shelf area anywhere
extending beyond the median line”, so that Malta is entitled to consider
that Italy has never objected to the median line method it had accepted in
regard to the Channel between Malta and Sicily and proposed for the
delimitation between Malta and the Pelagian Islands. Malta accordingly
concludes on the one hand that no dispute exists between it and Italy and,
on the other hand, that “Italy is now estopped from asserting its claim
against Malta by way of an application to intervene”. The application must
be rejected, as Italy has failed to provide evidence of a dispute. For,
according to Malta, if a dispute cannot be submitted to the Court in direct
contentious proceedings until its character and dimensions have been
established by prior negotiation, the same must a fortiori apply to “a
comparable application to intervene in proceedings commenced by agree-
ment, and pending between two States”. Since Italy has not availed itself of
its many opportunities of clearly pointing out to Malta the existence of a
disagreement or dispute concerning areas other than those between Malta
and the Pelagian Islands, it has, by its “silence” and “inactivity”, laid itself
open to having the claims it would now seek to assert declared inadmissible
by virtue of estoppel or preclusion.

26. Malta considers that the nature of the interest relied upon by Italy
has been insufficiently specified and that the application makes the object
