The Judgment denies the possibility of applying Article 6, paragraph 2,
of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf to these cases on a
purely conventional basis. It is a fact that the Federal Republic of
Germany has not ratified the Convention. Therefore, despite the Fede-
ral Government's having recognized the doctrine of the continental
shelf as embodied in Articles | to 3 of the Convention, despite its
reliance thereon in proclaiming its sovereign rights over the con-
tinental shelf, despite its having announced a bill for ratification, and
despite its conclusion with the Netherlands and Denmark of respective
treaties that fix partial continental shelf boundaries following “to some
extent .. . the equidistance line” or adopting a “seaward terminus...
equidistant from’ the coasts concerned (Memorials, para. 60) and are
thus more than consistent with paragraph 2 of Article 6, the Federal
Republic of Germany has disputed the possibility of regarding that
provision as binding upon it. It may be noted that, during the negotia-
tions which took place with the Netherlands and Denmark, the Federal
Republic contested this possibility only after a certain delay, and that it
was not consistent in doing so, since it even assumed as an alternative
possibility in its final Submissions that the rule contained in the second
sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 6 could be applicable between the
Parties, adding that “special circumstances within the meaning of that
rule would exclude the application of the equidistance method in the
present case”. In this Submission (No. 2) the Federal Republic linked the
principle of equidistance (though calling it a ““method™) with the *‘special
circumstances” rule, and it may be recalled that, during the oral pro-
ceedings, Counsel for Denmark and the Netherlands had combined them
in the form of the “equidistance special-circumstances™ rule.

The Judgment acknowledges that “such a rule was embodied in Article
6 of the Convention, but as a purely conventional rule” (paragraph 69).
However, as the Federal Republic has not ratified the Convention, the



Judgment considers that “qua conventional rule . . . it is not opposable to
the Federal Republic of Germany” (ibid.). It may be regretted that the
Judgment did not deal fully with the question as to whether “special
circumstances’ could in fact be established with regard to the maritime
boundaries between the Federal Republic and the Netherlands, and
between the Federal Republic and Denmark, respectively.

In its first finding, the Judgment uses the following words in respect of
each case: “(A) the use of the equidistance method of delimitation not
being obligatory as between the Parties.” It thus disjoins the equidistance
principle from the other two components of the triad: agreement-special
circumstances-equidistance. These three interconnected elements are
embodied in the Convention, as also in the Convention on the Territorial
Sea and the Contiguous Zone, and have entered into the province of the
general principles of international law, being consolidated as a combined
principle of customary international law. Each of these three elements
plays its part in the determination of a boundary line between two
maritime areas, such as areas of the continental shelf in particular.

Agreement is deemed to constitute the principal and most appropriate
method of determining the boundaries of the areas of any continental
shelf. This is confirmed by the practice of States. The Convention itself
gives it pride of place, and this was quite natural, as the issue was one
concerning the geographical limits of the sovereign rights of States. It
was unnecessary to prescribe at that stage any directives as to the con-
siderations on the basis of which parties ought to arrive at agreement.
Provided there is no encroachment on the sphere of the sovereign rights
of any other State, parties are free to agree on whatever terms they wish
for the delimitation of boundaries, bearing in mind, generally, both legal
and non-legal considerations: relevant political and economic factors,
related considerations of security and topography, the relations (*‘good-
neighbourly” or otherwise) between the States concerned, and whatever
imponderables may escape hard and fast classification. The assessment
of such considerations is a political and subjective matter, and it is not
for the Court as a judicial organ to concern itself with it unless the parties
submit to it a dispute on a question or questions of a really legal character.

The next element of the triad—the “special circumstances” situation—
is, however, an objective matter, concerning as it does, for instance, the
unusual geographical configuration of the coastline to either side of a
frontier, and a disagreement as to whether or not a certain situation
could be regarded as a case of “special circumstances” justifying an
appropriate boundary line would be a justiciable dispute.

And it is only after the failure of these two elements of the triad, in
the event of a deadlock, that the third element—the equidistance prin-
ciple—makes its appearance as the last resort, offering a way out of the
impasse in a geometrical construction which introduces a mathematical



definitude and a certainty of maritime boundaries. The Judgment itself
agrees that “it would probably be true to say that no other method of
delimitation has the same combination of practical convenience and
certainty of application’ (paragraph 23).

If it be held that the principles and rules inseparably embodied in
paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Convention are no more than treaty
provisions and are not, as such, opposable to the Federal Republic,
then one may ask whether these principles and rules are or have become
an institution of international law, either as general principles developed
in relation to the continental shelf, or as an embodiment of international
custom. There are sufficient grounds for considering them to qualify in
both these ways, but I am inclined to consider them rather as principles
of general international law, seeing that established doctrine lays much
stress on the time factor as a criterion of whether a given principle belongs
to customary international law: by and large, customary international
law turns its face to the past while general international law keeps abreast
of the times, conveying a sense of today and the near future by absorbing
the basic progressive principles of international law as soon as they are
developed.

Contemporary international law has developed not only quantitatively
but more especially qualitatively.

There has been far-reaching development of the work of the codifica-
tion of international law which has been organized in the United Nations
on a hitherto unknown scale. In the first stage, drafts of international
multilateral conventions were prepared by the International Law Com-
mission, composed of jurists “of recognized competence in international
law”, which in response to its request, received numerous comments and
observations from almost all governments. There followed, upon the
themes of those drafts, an increased amount of special literature (books
or articles) and the work of universities and research institutes, including
the Institute of International Law, and various learned societies (e.g., the
International Law Association). Then came the discussions in the General
Assembly of the reports and drafts prepared by the International Law
Commission. This preparatory work led finally to the convocation of
special intergovernmental conferences in which the great majority of
States participated. The scale and thoroughness of this process for the
forming and formulation of principles and rules of international law
should lead to the consideration in a new light of what is accepted as the
result of such work of codification.

Where it used to be considered indispensable, for determining certain



general principles of international law, to gather the relevant data brick
by brick, as it were, from governmental acts, declarations, diplomatic
notes, agreements and treaties, mostly on concrete matters, such prin-
ciples are now beginning to be crystallized by international conferences
which codify certain not inconsiderable areas of international law. Elihu
Root, the well-known jurist and statesman, one of the framers of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, wrote (in his
Prefatory Note to the Texts of the Peace Conferences at The Hague, 1899
and 1907, Boston 1908):

“The question about each international conference is not merely
what it has accomplished, but also what it has begun, and what it has
moved forward. Not only the conventions signed and ratified, but
the steps taken towards conclusions which may not reach practical
and effective form for many years to come, are of value.”

Elihu Root wrote this in connection with the Peace Conferences of 1899
and 1907. Certain principles which were embodied in The Hague Con-
ventions at that time have been acknowledged as principles of general
international law, though States have been slow to put them into practice.

The 1958 Conference on the Law of the Sea, with the Conventions
adopted there, among them the Convention on the Continental Shelf,
introduced substantial definitude in this field of international law; and
the principles and rules of the international law of the sea formulated
therein have become the general principles of that law with almost un-
precedented rapidity.

The rapid technical progress in the exploration and exploitation of
submarine oil and gas resources has entailed the necessity for correspond-
ing legal principles and rules. The practice of States has predetermined
the course of development of the doctrine as also of the principles and
rules of international law relating to the continental shelf.

The Anglo-Venezuelan Treaty Relating to the Submarine Areas of the
Gulf of Paria, 1942 (U.N. Legislative Series: Laws and Regulations on the
Régime of the High Seas, Vol. I (1951), p. 44) was followed in a com-
paratively short time by numerous unilateral governmental acts, such as
the Presidential Proclamation concerning the policy of the United States
with respect to the natural resources of the subsoil and seabed of the
continental shelf (1945), the Presidential Declaration (of Mexico) of the
same year with respect to the continental shelf, and decrees, laws and
declarations by almost all the other Latin American States (in the
period 1946-1951), and by the Arab States, Pakistan and others (U.N.
Legislative Series, Laws and Regulations on the Régime of the High Seas,
ST/LEG/SER.B/1).

As a result of the inclusion in the work of the United Nations of the
task of determining the principles and rules of international law relating



to the continental shelf, the general principles of the law of the continental
shelf had already taken shape before the Conference, though not in a
finally “polished” form, on the basis of governmental acts, agreements
and scientific works. The Geneva Conference of 1958, in the Convention
on the Continental Shelf which was adopted, gave definite formulation
to the principles and rules relating thereto. These were consolidated in
subsequent practice in a growing number of governmental acts, interna-
tional declarations and agreements (as mentioned in the written and oral
proceedings), which in most cases referred to the Convention or, when
they did not do so, made use of its wording. All this has led to the develop-
ment, in great measure organized and not spontaneous, of the general
principles of international law relating to the continental shelf, in not
only their generality but also their concreteness. Thus, by a kind of
coalescence of the principles, a genuine communis opinio juris on the
matter has come into being. States, even some not having acceded to the
Convention, have followed its principles because to do so was for them a
recognition of necessity, and have thereby given practical expression to
the other part of the well-known formula opinio juris sive necessitatis.

And this conclusion might be reached also by deducing these principles
as “direct and inevitable consequences” of the premises and considering

This finds confirmation in the doctrine which regards the continental
shelf as being an actual continuation of the submarine areas of the territo-
rial sea, which, in its turn, is a continuation of the mainland of the coastal
State. The United States Presidential Proclamation of 1945, asserting the
right of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the natural resources
of the subsoil and seabed of the continental shelf, regarded that shelf “as
an extension of the land-mass of the coastal nation and thus naturally ap-
purtenant to it”. In 1946 an Argentine decree stated : “The continental shelf
is closely united to the mainland both in a morphological and a geological
sense.’ The Peruvian Presidential Decree of 1947 stated that “the continen-
tal submerged shelf forms one entire morphological and geological unit
with the continent”, and the decrees of almost all other Latin American
countries employ virtually identical expressions. (U.N. Legislative Series,
Laws and Regulations on the Régime of the High Seas, ST;LEG;/SER.B/1).
The Judgment also recognizes that the submarine areas of the continental
shelf” may be deemed to be actually part of the territory over which
the coastal State already has dominion—in the sense that, although
covered with water, they are a prolongation or continuation of that
territory, an extension of it under the sea” (paragraph 43).



But what conclusion can be drawn from this premise—in relation to
principles and rules of international law which govern or should govern
the delimitation of a given part of the continental shelf? Bearing in mind
that the continental shelf constitutes, as is stated in the operative part of
the Judgment, under (C) (1), “a natural prolongation of” each Party’s
“land territory into and under the sea” (including, may 1 add, the
territorial sea appertaining to the same coastal State), the question might
be asked as to whether there exist, for the delimitation of the continental
shelf as between “adjacent States, any special principles and rules
different from those which have been established (in State practice,
treaties, agreements, etc.) in relation to the delimitation of such maritime
areas as the territorial sea. Concerning any possible connection between
the conceivable principles—whether similar or different—governing the
delimitation, respectively, of the territorial sea and of the continental
shelf, it may be noted, in the first place, that the sovereign rights of a
coastal State over its territorial sea and over the continental shelf are
different in scope.

In relation to the territorial sea three “strata” (to use that term) may
be distinguished: (a) the maritime area, (b) the seabed and its subsoil and
{c) the air-space. The sovereignty of a coastal State extends to all three of
these strata with regard to the territorial sea adjacent to its coast.

In relation to a contiguous zone the coastal State has ceitain rights
in connection with a delimited maritime area.

In relation to the continental shelf, that is to say, to the seabed and
subsoil of submarine areas adjacent to a given coast, but outside the
area of the territorial sea (ergo, submarine areas of the contiguous zone
included), the coastal State has “sovereign rights for the purpose of
exploring it and exploiting its natural resources”, not affecting “the
legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the air-
space above these waters”.

Thus, there has occurred some kind of bifurcation of the legal régimes
of the territorial sea and of the continental shelf. The maritime and air
“strata” over the continental shelf are outside the sphere of the rights
of a given coastal State. But the continental shelf itself is within the
sphere of the special territorial (though limited) rights of the coastal
State to which it is appurtenant, on the ground of the close physical
relationship of the continental shelf with the mainland (via the submarine
area of its territorial sea), as being its natural prolongation, as was
recognized by the Court and has become the generally recognized concept
of international law. Although Bracton might have considered the sea
coast “quasi maris accessorid”, which was historically understandable,
not only the territorial sea but also the continental shelf may now be
considered as “accessories” of or, in the words of the Judgment in the

- Fisheries case, as “appurtenant to the land territory” (Z.C.J. Reports
1951, p. 128; in French, more explicitly, “comme accessoire du territoire



terrestre”) !. To apply the old adage accessorium sequitur suum principale,
this appurtenance may be considered as entailing common principles for
the delimitation of maritime spaces, that is to say for both the territorial
sea and the continental shelf.

This explains why, in the International Law Commission, almost
from the beginning, it was frequently said that the question of the delimi-
tation of the continental shelf is, in the words of M. Cordova, a former
Judge of the International Court, “closely bound up with the delimitation
of territorial waters” (7.L.C. Yearbook, 1951, Vol. 1, p. 289).

The starting-point for determining the boundaries of a continental
shelf is formed by the definitive boundaries of the territorial sea of a
given State (Article 1 of the Convention on the Continental Shelf defines

in mind that their dclimitation should be effected not in accordance with
the principles and rules applicable to the delimitation of land territories
themselves, but in accordance with those applicable to the delimitation
of maritime areas covering such a prolongation of a territory.

Until recently, attention was mainly directed to the delimitation of the
territorial sea and contiguous zone and, to some extent, of the continental
shelf, in a seaward direction, since the complexities of inter-State relations
and contradictions gave rise to problems concerning the correlation of the
freedom of the high seas with the sovereignty of coastal States over their
territorial sea and, associated therewith, problems of navigation, innocent
passage, fisheries, etc. Questions of policy and, in the words of Article 24
of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone,
questions concerning the prevention of infringements of a given State’s
customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations, committed within its
territory, or within its territorial sea, gave rise to certain problems con-
cerning lateral boundaries. When the exploitation of the natural resources
of the subsoil of the sea became a real possibility, and the problems
connected with the delimitation of the continental shelf area not only
in a seaward direction but more especially between neighbouring States
whose continental shelf is adjacent to their coasts, became more acute,
the character of the “territoriality” of the sovereign rights of a coastal
State called for more certainty and more definiteness and almost, indeed,
for mathematical precision.

Inevitably, the definition of the boundary of a given part of the con-
tinental shelf must be effected not on the shelf itself but on the waters
which cover it. This entails the application to the delimitation of the
continental shelf of principles and rules appropriate to the delimitation

! It may also be noted that the delegate of the Federal Republic of Germany to
the Geneva Conference of 1958, Professor Miinch, declared that he was in agreement
with the wording of Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, ‘’subject to an interpretation of
the words ‘special circumstances’ as meaning that any exceptional delimitation of the
territorial waters would affect the delimitation of the continental shelf” (U.N.
Conference on the Law of the Sea, Official Records, VI, 4th Committee, p. 98).



of sea areas and accordingly of the territorial sea, the boundaries of
which can be described as mathematically, geometrically constructed in
a manner that is as simple as is permitted by the configuration of the
coast or by the baselines.

Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Convention envisages cases where the
same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two adjacent
States. It follows that when it is a question of delimiting the boundary of
the continental shelves of two coastal States in conformity with existing
principles and rules, and even if the presence of special circumstances is
observed and confirmed, those special circumstances can only justify a
deviation from the normal line if they are located comparatively near to
the landward starting-point of the boundary line of the continental shelf
adjacent to the territories of the two (and only two) adjacent States.
Moreover, the boundary line will generally be constructed with reference
to the baselines of the territorial sea, in the drawing of which due allow-
ance will alieady have been made for certain irregularities of configura-
tion. At all events, the factors concerned should be considered only in
relation to the determination of a single boundary line between two
adjacent States, while the influence of any special circumstances on both
must be taken into account. All “macrogeographical” considerations

French Republic will not accept that any boundary of the continental
shelf determined by application of the principle of equidistance shall
be invoked against it: .. . if it lies in areas where, in the Govern-
ment’s opinion, there are ‘special circumstances’ within the meaning



of Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, that is to say: the Bay of Biscay, the
Bay of Granville, and the sea areas of the Straits of Dover and
of the North Sea off the French Coast” [translation by the Registry]
(Status of Multilateral conventions in respect of which the Secretary-
General performs depositary functions; ST/LEG/SER.D/1).

And the Government of Yugoslavia made a reservation in respect of
Article 6 of the Convention which can easily be understood in view of its
positive attitude to the principle of equidistance !. In its instrument of
ratification, the Government of Yugoslavia stated: “In delimiting its
continental shelf, Yugoslavia recognizes no ‘special circumstances’
which should influence that delimitation” (idem).

What are, in effect, the principles and what has been the practice, with
regard to the delimitation of the territorial sea?

Sovereign rights over the territorial sea, like all territorial rights, have
an inherent spatial reference, and every such right is subject to certain
limits which are determined by historically developed principles. The
