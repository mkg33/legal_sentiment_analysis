                         The Gulf Cooperation Council (hereinafter the “GCC”) is an intergov-
                     ernmental political and economic union of which Qatar and the UAE
                     were founding members in 1981, along with the Kingdom of Bahrain, the
                     State of Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
                     bia.
                         27. In addition, the 5 June 2017 statement announced the severance of
                     diplomatic relations with Qatar, in support of actions taken by the
                     ­Kingdom of Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, giving Qatari
                      diplomats 48 hours to leave the UAE. It also proclaimed the “[c]losure of
                      UAE airspace and seaports for all Qataris in 24 hours and banning [of]
                      all Qatari means of transportation, coming to or leaving the UAE, from
                      crossing, entering or leaving the UAE territories”.


                       28. The 5 June 2017 statement explained:
                             “The UAE is taking these decisive measures as a result of the Qatari
                          authorities’ failure to abide by the Riyadh Agreement on returning
                          GCC diplomats to Doha and its Complementary Arrangement
                          in 2014, and Qatar’s continued support, funding and hosting of terror
                          groups, primarily Islamic Brotherhood, and its sustained endeavours
                          to promote the ideologies of Daesh and Al Qaeda across its direct
                          and indirect media in addition to Qatar’s violation of the statement
                          issued at the US‑Islamic Summit in Riyadh on May 21st, 2017 on
                          countering terrorism in the region and considering Iran a state spon-
                          sor of terrorism. The UAE measures are taken as well based on Qatari
                          authorities’ hosting of terrorist elements and meddling in the affairs
                          of other countries as well as their support of terror groups — policies
                          which are likely to push the region into a stage of unpredictable con-
                          sequences.”



                        29. According to an announcement posted on the website of the Minis-
                     try of Foreign Affairs and International Co‑operation of the UAE on
                     11 June 2017, the President of the UAE had “instructed the authorities
                     concerned to take into consideration the humanitarian circumstances of
                     Emirati-­Qatari joint families”. The announcement further provided that
                     “the Ministry of the Interior ha[d] set up a telephone line . . . to receive
                     such cases and take appropriate measures to help them”. In a statement

                     85 	              application of the cerd (judgment)

                     dated 5 July 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
                     Co‑operation of the UAE specified that 

                          “[s]ince its announcement on June 5, 2017 . . . the UAE has instituted
                          a requirement for all Qatari citizens overseas to obtain prior permis-
                          sion for entry into the UAE. Permission may be granted for a limited-­
                          duration period, at the discretion of the UAE [G]overnment.”

                       The statement added that
                             “Qatari citizens already resident in the UAE need not apply for
                          permission to continue residence in the UAE. However, all Qatari
                          citizens resident in the UAE are encouraged to obtain prior permis-
                          sion for re-entry into UAE territory. All applications for entry clear-
                          ance may be made through the telephone hotline announced on
                          June 11, 2017.”


                        30. The UAE took certain additional measures relating to Qatari media
                     and speech in support of Qatar. In this regard, on 6 June 2017, the Attor-
                     ney General of the UAE issued a statement indicating that expressions of
                     sympathy for the State of Qatar or objections to the measures taken by
                     the UAE against the Qatari Government were considered crimes punish-
                     able by imprisonment and a fine. The UAE blocked several websites
                     operated by Qatari companies, including those run by Al Jazeera Media
                     Network. On 6 July 2017, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic
                     Development issued a circular prohibiting the broadcasting of certain
                     television channels operated by Qatari companies.


                        31. On 8 March 2018, Qatar deposited a communication with the Com-
                     mittee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter the
                     “CERD Committee”) under Article 11 of the Convention, requesting that
                     the UAE take all necessary steps to end the measures enacted and imple-
                     mented since 5 June 2017. According to Article 11, paragraph 1, of
                     CERD, “[i]f a State Party considers that another State Party is not giving
                     effect to the provisions of this Convention, it may bring the matter to the
                     attention of the Committee”. The UAE, through its responses dated
                     29 November 2018, 14 January 2019 and 19 March 2019, requested “the
                     Committee to dismiss Qatar’s Article 11 Communication for lack [of]
                     jurisdiction and/or lack of admissibility”.

                       32. On 11 June 2018, Qatar filed an Application in the Registry of the
                     Court instituting the present proceedings (see paragraph 1 above).
                       33. In its decision on jurisdiction with regard to Qatar’s inter‑State
                     communication, dated 27 August 2019, the CERD Committee con-





6 Ord_1221.indb 32                                                                                  4/08/22 08:26

                     cluded that “it ha[d] jurisdiction to examine the exceptions of inadmissi-
                     bility raised by the Respondent State” (Decision on the jurisdiction of the
                     Committee over the inter‑State communication submitted by Qatar against
                     the UAE dated 27 August 2019, UN doc. CERD/C/99/3, para. 60). In its
                     decision on the admissibility of the inter‑State communication, also dated
                     27 August 2019, the CERD Committee concluded as follows:

                            “64. In respect of the inter-state communication submitted on
                          8 March 2018 by Qatar against the United Arab Emirates, the Com-
                          mittee rejects the exceptions raised by the Respondent State concern-
                          ing the admissibility of the inter-state communication.
                            65. The Committee requests its Chairperson to appoint, in accord-
                          ance with article 12 (1) of the Convention, the members of an ad hoc
                          Conciliation Commission, which shall make its good offices available
                          to the States concerned with a view to an amicable solution of the
                          matter on the basis of the States parties’ compliance with the Con-
                          vention.” (Decision on the admissibility of the inter-State communi-
                          cation submitted by Qatar against the UAE dated 27 August 2019,
                          UN doc. CERD/C/99/4, paras. 64‑65.)
                        34. By a Note Verbale dated 27 April 2020, addressed by the Perma-
                     nent Mission of the UAE in Geneva to the Office of the High Commis-
                     sioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Mission “note[d] with
                     appreciation the [Office’s] Note Verbale of 9 April 2020 advising that the
                     ad hoc Conciliation Commission has been appointed by the Chair of the
                     Committee, and has been effective since 1 March 2020”.

                                        B. The Jurisdictional Basis Invoked
                                       and the Preliminary Objections Raised
                       35. Qatar asserts that the Court has jurisdiction over its Application
                     pursuant to Article 22 of CERD, which provides:
                             “Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to
                          the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not set-
                          tled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this
                          Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute,
                          be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless
                          the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.”

                       36. Qatar and the UAE are parties to CERD. Qatar acceded to this
                     Convention on 22 July 1976 without entering any reservation. The UAE
                     did so on 20 June 1974 without entering any reservation relevant to the
                     present proceedings.
                       37. Qatar contends that there is a dispute between the Parties with
                     respect to the interpretation and application of CERD and that the Par-





6 Ord_1221.indb 34                                                                                  4/08/22 08:26

                     87 	               application of the cerd (judgment)

                     ties have been unable to settle this dispute despite Qatar’s attempts to
                     negotiate with the UAE.
                        38. At the present stage of these proceedings, the UAE asks the Court
                     to adjudge and declare that the Court lacks jurisdiction to address the
                     claims brought by Qatar on the basis of two preliminary objections. In its
                     first preliminary objection, the UAE maintains that the Court lacks juris-
                     diction ratione materiae over the dispute between the Parties because the
                     alleged acts do not fall within the scope of CERD. In its second prelimi-
                     nary objection, the UAE asserts that Qatar failed to satisfy the proce-
                     dural preconditions of Article 22 of CERD.

                       39. The Court notes that, in its written pleadings, the UAE had also
                     included an objection to admissibility on the ground that Qatar’s claims
                     constitute an abuse of process. However, during the oral proceedings,
                     counsel for the UAE stated that it was not pursuing an allegation of
                     abuse of process at this stage of the proceedings.
                       40. Before addressing the preliminary objections of the UAE, the Court
                     will determine the subject‑matter of the dispute.


                                         II. Subject-­Matter of the Dispute

                        41. Pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute and Article 38,
                     paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, an applicant is required to indicate
                     the subject of a dispute in its application. The Rules of Court also require
                     that an application “specify the precise nature of the claim, together with
                     a succinct statement of the facts and grounds on which the claim is based”
                     (Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court). A Memorial “shall con-
                     tain a statement of the relevant facts, a statement of law, and the submis-
                     sions” (Article 49, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court).

                        42. It is for the Court itself to determine on an objective basis the subject‑
                     matter of the dispute between the parties, by isolating the real issue in the
                     case and identifying the object of the applicant’s claims. In doing so, the
                     Court examines the application, as well as the written and oral pleadings
                     of the parties, while giving particular attention to the formulation of the
                     dispute chosen by the applicant. It takes account of the facts that the
                     applicant presents as the basis for its claims. The matter is one of sub-
                     stance, not of form (Application of the International Convention for the
                     Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Conven-

                     88 	              application of the cerd (judgment)

                        43. According to the Applicant, its “Application concerns a legal dis-
                     pute between Qatar and the UAE regarding the UAE’s deliberate and
                     flagrant violations of the CERD”. It claims that “[t]he UAE has enacted
                     and implemented a series of discriminatory measures directed at Qataris
                     based expressly on their national origin — measures that remain in effect
                     to this day”.
                        44. Qatar further characterizes the subject-­matter of the dispute in the
                     written statement of its observations and submissions on the preliminary
                     objections as follows:
                             “As Qatar explained in its Application, Memorial, and during the
                          provisional measures phase of the proceedings, Qatar’s claims are
                          based on acts and omissions of the UAE that discriminate against
                          Qataris on the basis of national origin and in violation of Arti-
                          cles 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the CERD. These acts and omissions include,
                          in particular, the collective expulsion of Qataris from the UAE pur-
                          suant to its 5 June Directive (the ‘Expulsion Order’); the absolute ban
                          on entry to the UAE by Qataris (the ‘Absolute Travel Ban’), which
                          was later modified by the imposition of a ‘hotline’ and website pro-
                          cedure that continue to restrict Qataris’ entry into the UAE on an
                          arbitrary and discriminatory basis (the ‘Modified Travel Ban’); and
                          the enactment of measures encouraging anti‑Qatari hate propaganda
                          and prejudice, and suppressing Qatari media and speech deemed to
                          support Qatar (including, respectively, the ‘Anti‑Qatari Incitement
                          Campaign’, the ‘Anti‑Sympathy Law’, and the ‘Block on Qatari

                        45. Qatar states that the measures it describes as the “expulsion order”
                     and the “travel bans”, by their express reference to Qatari nationals, dis-
                     criminate against Qataris on the basis of their current nationality. It
                     points out that the definition of “racial discrimination” contained in Arti-
                     cle 1, paragraph 1, of CERD includes discrimination on the basis of
                     national origin. Qatar maintains that “nationality” is encompassed within
                     the phrase “national origin”.

                       46. Qatar also alleges that the UAE directly targeted Qatari media cor-
                     porations by blocking access to their websites and broadcasts in all or
                     part of the UAE’s territory. It maintains that these measures were
                     imposed “on racially discriminatory grounds” and that CERD extends to
                     racial discrimination against “institutions”, which it considers to include
                     corporations.

                     89 	              application of the cerd (judgment)

                        47. Qatar also points out that CERD applies to measures that are not
                     framed as distinctions on the basis of a protected ground but have in fact
                     the purpose or effect of racial discrimination. It maintains that, regardless
                     of whether the measures imposed by the UAE are explicitly based on
                     Qatari nationality, they have the purpose or effect of nullifying or impair-
                     ing the rights and freedoms of persons of Qatari national origin, in the
                     sense of their Qatari heritage and culture. It contends that such measures
                     give rise to “indirect discrimination”.

                       48. As one part of its claim of indirect discrimination, Qatar asserts
                     that the measures which discriminate on the basis of current Qatari
                     nationality violate the UAE’s obligations under CERD for another inde-
                     pendent reason, “because they have an unjustifiable disparate impact on
                     individuals of Qatari origin, in the sense of their heritage and culture”.


                        49. As further support for its claim of indirect discrimination, Qatar
                     maintains that a number of measures imposed by the UAE encourage
                     anti‑Qatari propaganda and suppress speech deemed to be in support of
                     Qatar. It refers to the ban on Qatari media corporations as well as a
                     6 June 2017 announcement of the Attorney General of the UAE which
                     stated that persons “expressing sympathy, bias or affection for” the State
                     of Qatar or “objecting to the . . . measures . . . taken [by the UAE] against
                     the Qatari [G]overnment” are considered to have committed crimes pun-
                     ishable by imprisonment and a fine (see paragraph 30 above). Qatar con-
                     tends that, although this statement refers to the “Qatari Government”, it
                     is “clearly understood as a reference to Qatar qua State and Qatar qua
                     Qataris”. Additionally, Qatar alleges that the UAE has attempted to
                     incite discrimination against Qataris, referring to statements in social and
                     traditional media by persons it identifies as officials of the UAE, which it
                     considers to be attributable to the UAE.



                        50. Qatar points out that the UAE’s measures are not exclusively
                     addressed to Qataris on the basis of their current nationality and asserts
                     that it has from the beginning framed its case to include a claim of unjus-
                     tifiable disparate impact. It alleges that the measures imposed by the
                     UAE penalize persons of Qatari national origin based on their identifica-
                     tion with Qatari national traditions and culture, their Qatari accent or
                     their Qatari dress. It further alleges that these measures discriminate
                     against persons who are not Qatari citizens on the basis of their cultural
                     identification as “Qataris”.

                     90 	              application of the cerd (judgment)

                        51. The UAE asserts that the subject‑matter of the dispute is alleged
                     discrimination on the basis of current Qatari nationality, a term that, in
                     its view, is distinct from “national origin”. It contends that claims arising
                     from the measures that Qatar describes as the “expulsion order” and the
                     “travel bans” are founded on differential treatment of persons based on
                     their Qatari nationality.


                        52. The UAE maintains that Qatar seeks to blur the distinction between
                     the terms “nationality” and “national origin” by using the two terms
                     interchangeably and by referring obliquely to “Qataris” in its written and
                     oral pleadings.
                        53. The UAE acknowledges that it has imposed restrictions on websites
                     of some Qatari media corporations, stating that it did so on the basis of
                     content restrictions, pursuant to UAE law. It considers that measures
                     that address corporations do not fall within the definition of racial dis-
                     crimination contained in CERD and thus that Qatar’s claims with respect
                     to the measures to restrict transmissions of Qatari media corporations are
                     outside the scope of CERD.


                        54. The UAE also maintains that the restrictions on Qatari media and
                     the other facts that Qatar invokes in support of its allegations of incite-
                     ment and suppression of free speech, even if established, are not indica-
                     tive of a claim of racial discrimination, but rather must be assessed in the
                     context of the UAE’s conviction that Qatar supports terrorism, extrem-
                     ism and intervention. It points out that Qatar itself frames its allegation
                     of incitement by accusing the UAE of “media attacks on Qatar” and the
                     dissemination of false reports “accusing Qatar of support for terrorism”.
                     It notes that the 6 June 2017 statement of the Attorney General of the
                     UAE relates to persons who express support for the State of Qatar, not
                     to persons of Qatari national origin.



                        55. The UAE accepts that disguised discrimination against members of
                     a protected group would fall within the scope of CERD. However, it con-
                     tends that, in the present case, the subject‑matter of the dispute is limited
                     to alleged direct discrimination on the basis of current nationality and
                     does not extend to “indirect discrimination” because this is not the case
                     that Qatar has pleaded. According to the UAE, Qatar has introduced
                     legal arguments relating to “indirect discrimination” because its claim of
                     direct discrimination on the basis of national origin does not withstand
                     scrutiny.

                     91 	              application of the cerd (judgment)

                       56. As can be seen from Qatar’s characterization of the subject-­matter
                     of the dispute (see paragraph 44 above), Qatar makes three claims of
                     racial discrimination. The first is its claim arising out of the “travel bans”
                     and “expulsion order”, which make express reference to Qatari nationals.
                     The second is its claim arising from the restrictions on Qatari media cor-
                     porations. Qatar’s third claim is that the measures taken by the UAE,
                     including the measures on which Qatar bases its first and second claims,
                     result in “indirect discrimination” on the basis of Qatari national origin.
                     In order to determine the subject-­matter of the dispute, the Court will
                     consider these three claims in turn.

                        57. As noted above (see paragraph 45), Qatar states that the “expulsion
                     order” and the “travel bans”, by their express reference to Qatari nation-
                     als, discriminate against Qataris on the basis of their current nationality.
                     The UAE acknowledges that these measures differentiate between Qataris
                     and other persons on the basis of their current nationality, but does not
                     agree that the measures violate its obligations under CERD. The Parties’
                     characterization of the basis for the challenged measures is consistent
                     with the text of the measures themselves, which refer, inter alia, to “Qatari
                     residents and visitors”, “Qatari nationals”, “Qataris”, “Qatari citizens”
                     and “travellers holding Qatari passports”.
