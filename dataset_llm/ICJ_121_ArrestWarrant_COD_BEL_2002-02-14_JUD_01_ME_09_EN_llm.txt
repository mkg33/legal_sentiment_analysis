part of its dispositif, that Belgium must cancel the arrest warrant and so
inform the authorities to which the warrant was circulated (Judgment,
para. 78 (3)).

warrant was not enforced when Mr. Yerodia visited Belgium on an offi-
cial visit in June 2000, and Belgium, although it circulated the warrant
internationally via an Interpol Green Notice, did not request Mr. Yero-
dia’s extradition as long as he was in office. The request for an Interpol
Red Notice was only made in 2001, after Mr. Yerodia had ceased to be a
Minister.

3. Belgium has, at present, very broad legislation that allows victims of
alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity to institute criminal pro-
ceedings in its courts. This triggers negative reactions in some circles,
while inviting acclaim in others. Belgium's conduct (by its Parliament,
judiciary and executive powers) may show a lack of international cour-
tesy. Even if this were true, it does not follow that Belgium actually vio-
lated (customary or conventional) international law. Political wisdom
may command a change in Belgian legislation, as has been proposed in

various circles'. Judicial wisdom may lead to a more restrictive applica-
tion of the present statute, and may result from proceedings that are
pending before the Belgian courts”. This does not mean that Belgium has
acted in violation of international law by applying it in the case of
Mr. Yerodia. I see no evidence for the existence of such a norm, not in
conventional or in customary international law for the reasons set out
below 3.

which they called for a revision of the Belgian Act of 1993/1999. The Government referred
the matter to the Parliament, where a bill was introduced in December 2001 (Proposition

or allows States to do as “agents” of the international community when
they are confronted with complaints of victims of such crimes, given the
fact that international criminal courts will not be able to judge a// inter-
national crimes. It was about balancing two divergent interests in modern

functions of Foreign Ministers with those of Ambassadors and other dip-
lomatic agents on the one hand, and those of Heads of State and Heads
of Governments on the other, whereupon it reaches the following conclu-
sion (Judgment, para. 54):

“The Court accordingly concludes that the functions of a Minister
for Foreign Affairs are such that, throughout the duration of his or
her office, he or she when abroad enjoys full immunity from criminal
jurisdiction and inviolability. That immunity and that inviolability
protect the individual concerned against any act of authority of
another State which would hinder him or her in the performance of
his or her duties.”

9. On the other hand, the Court, looking at State practice in the field
of war crimes and crimes against humanity (Judgment, para. 58), decides
that:

“It has been unable to deduce from this practice that there exists
under customary international law any form of exception to the rule
according immunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability to
incumbent Ministers for Foreign Affairs, where they are suspected
of having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.”

10. I disagree with the reasoning of the Court, which can be summa-
rized as follows: (a) there is a rule of customary international law grant-
ing “full” immunity to incumbent Foreign Ministers (Judgment, para. 54),
and (h) there is no rule of customary international law departing from
this rule in the case of war crimes and crimes against humanity (Judg-
ment, para. 58). Both propositions are wrong.

First, there is no rule of customary international law protecting incum-
bent Foreign Ministers against criminal prosecution. International com-
ity and political wisdom may command restraint, but there is no obliga-
tion under positive international law on States to refrain from exercising
jurisdiction in the case of incumbent Foreign Ministers suspected of war


The frequency, or even habitual character of the acts is not in itself
enough. There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of
ceremony and protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but
which are motivated only by considerations of courtesy, convenience
or tradition, and not by any sense of legal duty.” '°

In the Nicaragua case, the Court held that:

“Bound as it is by Article 38 of its Statute to apply, inter alia,
international custom ‘as evidence of a general practice accepted as
law’, the Court may not disregard the essential role played by gen-
eral practice . . . The Court must satisfy itself that the existence of
the rule in the opinio juris of States is confirmed by practice.” !!

13. In the present case, there is no settled practice (usus) about the
postulated “full” immunity of Foreign Ministers to which the Interna-
tional Court of Justice refers in paragraph 54 of its present Judgment.
There may be limited State practice about immunities for current'? or
former Heads of State '* in national courts, but there is no such practice
about Foreign Ministers. On the contrary, the practice rather seems to be
that there are hardly any examples of Foreign Ministers being granted
