                       1. I regret that I have had to vote against the Court’s Judgment on all
                    of the findings in this case and will elaborate on my reasons in this dis-
                    sent.
                       2. As a preliminary matter, I would note that I voted against the Court
                    on the finding “that the Republic of Colombia must, by means of its own
                    choosing, bring into conformity with customary international law the
                    provisions of Presidential Decree 1946 of 9 September 2013”, because the
                    finding focused on the provisions of Presidential Decree 1946 which dealt
                    with the powers to be exercised within the Integral Contiguous Zone
                    (hereinafter “ICZ”). As I will point out in this dissent, I consider that the
                    powers asserted by Colombia are among those that a State may exercise




7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 342                                                                                     10/09/23 09:40

                    in its contiguous zone consistently with customary international law.
                    However, I agree with the Court that the configuration of Colombia’s
                    ICZ put before the Court is not in conformity with customary interna-
                    tional law in so far as it exceeds 24 nautical miles. Thus, when it formally
                    establishes the outer limits of its ICZ, Colombia must ensure that those
                    limits do not exceed 24 nautical miles.

                       3. I start with the issue of jurisdiction ratione temporis raised by
                    Colombia in the course of these proceedings.
                       4. I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that it has jurisdiction in
                    respect of events that allegedly took place after the lapse of the jurisdic-
                    tional title (Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá) on 27 November 2013.
                    The point is critical because the conclusion of the Court that by interfer-
                    ing with the fishing and marine scientific activities of Nicaraguan‑flagged
                    or ‑licensed vessels and purporting to enforce conservation measures
                    Colombia has violated Nicaragua’s rights within its exclusive economic
                    zone (hereinafter “EEZ”) is based essentially on events that took place
                    after the lapse of jurisdictional title. In other words, were it not for the
                    events that occurred after the lapse of title, the Court would have had no
                    basis for its conclusion in the second subparagraph of its operative clause
                    that Colombia had violated Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction
                    within its EEZ. In short, Colombia is found internationally responsible
                    on the basis of alleged violations of Nicaragua’s rights and jurisdiction
                    that took place after the Court’s jurisdictional title had lapsed.


                       5. On 27 November 2013, Colombia’s denunciation of the Pact of
                    Bogotá came into effect, and from that point on the Court ceased to have
                    jurisdiction in respect of claims brought against Colombia under the Pact.
                    This is made evident in Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá which pro-
                    vides for the jurisdiction of the Court “as compulsory ipso facto, without
                    the necessity of any special agreement so long as the present Treaty is in
                    force”. Indeed, the Court recognized this jurisdictional limit in its Judg-
                    ment of 17 March 2016 on preliminary objections, where it accepted that
                    it had jurisdiction over Nicaragua’s claim because it was filed on
                    26 November 2013, the day before the lapse of jurisdictional title in
                    accordance with Colombia’s denunciation of the Pact of Bogotá 1. In

                    doing so, the Court applied the well‑established principle that its jurisdic-
                    tion is to be determined as of the date of application 2.
                       6. The Court justifies its assumption of jurisdiction in respect of events
                    that took place after jurisdiction had lapsed, on the basis of the principle,
                    also well established in the Court’s jurisprudence, that jurisdiction extends
                    to “facts subsequent to the filing of the Application, but arising directly
                    out of the question which is the subject‑matter of that Application” 3.
                    But, until this case, the principle had never been applied to cases where
                    the events subsequent to the filing of the application are events over which
                    the Court otherwise had no jurisdiction. In none of the cases referred to

                    arise.
                       7. The Court treats the limitation in Article XXXI as applicable only
                    to “the subject‑matter of a dispute over which the Court may exercise
                    jurisdiction” (Judgment, para. 40). Since in its 2016 Judgment the Court
                    had already determined that it did have jurisdiction, the question before
                    it now “is whether its jurisdiction over that dispute extends to facts or
                    events that allegedly occurred after the lapse of the title of jurisdiction”
                    (ibid.).
                       8. In the critical part of its Judgment, the Court says that consider-
                    ations relevant to the adjudication of claims or submissions subsequent to
                    the date of application can be instructive in deciding this case, which
                    deals with events that were certainly subsequent to the date of application
                    but also, critically, subsequent to the lapse of title of jurisdiction. The

                    should apply to the question of jurisdiction ratione temporis in this case,
                    that is where the events in question are subsequent to the date of lapse of
                    title. The Court notes that, in the case of claims or submissions that have
                    occurred subsequent to the date of application, it has “considered whether
                    such a claim or submission arose directly out of the question which is the
                    subject‑matter of the application or whether entertaining such a claim or
                    submission would transform the subject of the dispute originally submit-
                    ted to the Court” (ibid., para. 44). This, then, becomes the test for decid-
                    ing whether jurisdiction can be taken over events occurring after the lapse
                    of title. However, the Court does not explain how a dispute dealing with

                    a dispute dealing with events over which the Court has jurisdiction. It
                    affirms that the rule for events subsequent to the date of application

                    should be applied to events subsequent to the lapse of jurisdictional title
                    but provides no explanation or rationale to show why this affirmation is
                    justified.

                       9. The rule allowing the Court to treat events subsequent to the date
                    that jurisdiction is established makes sense because it encourages effi-
                    ciency; that is, it would be inefficient to require an applicant to bring a
                    new application in respect of events that are part of the same dispute
                    when they can be dealt with in the application already brought. But in the
                    case of events subsequent to the loss of title of jurisdiction, no such effi-
                    ciency considerations can be shown. A new application could not be
                    brought in respect of events subsequent to the title of jurisdiction lapsing,
                    because there would be no such title to do so. So, instead of applying a
                    rule that encourages efficiency in cases where jurisdiction is established,

                    when no such jurisdiction would otherwise exist.


                       10. The Court points out that there is “nothing in the Court’s jurispru-
                    dence to suggest that the lapse of jurisdictional title after the institution of
                    proceedings has the effect of limiting the Court’s jurisdiction ratione tem‑
                    poris to facts which allegedly occurred before that lapse” (Judgment,
                    para. 42). But equally, there is nothing in the Court’s jurisprudence to say
                    that the Court can take jurisdiction over events that have occurred after
                    the lapse of jurisdictional title.

                    Court has jurisdiction to examine every aspect of the dispute” (ibid.,
                    para. 45). But the Court was careful in 2016 to identify the dispute on the
                    basis of events that allegedly occurred before the date of the Application.
                    It would be strange in light of this to conclude, now, that the Court at
                    that time was asserting that it could assume jurisdiction over events alleg-
                    edly occurring after the title of jurisdiction had lapsed. At best the matter
                    is simply not dealt with in the 2016 Judgment, and no inference can be
                    drawn from it.
                       12. The Court’s conclusion that “consideration” of alleged incidents
                    that occurred after the lapse of jurisdiction “does not transform the
                    nature of the dispute between the Parties” (ibid., para. 47) and, thus, it
                    has jurisdiction over those incidents, masks the reality of what is being
                    decided. The question before the Court is not whether it can “entertain”
                    or “consider” incidents subsequent to the date of filing of the Application
                    (ibid., para. 41) or date of lapse of title (ibid., para. 47). Of course, the
                    Court can “consider” or “entertain” events that took place after the lapse
                    of title as part of the broader context of the case. But that is different
                    from determining responsibility based on such events.


                       13. What is at issue in this case is whether the Court can find responsi-
                    bility on the basis of events that occurred at the time when the Court had
                    no jurisdiction. To say that consideration of subsequent events after the
                    title has lapsed does not transform the nature of the dispute (Judgment,
                    para. 47), ignores the fact that responsibility based on events before title
                    lapses is responsibility in respect of a matter over which the Court has
                    jurisdiction. Responsibility on the basis of events that were subsequent to
                    the lapse of title is responsibility in respect of events over which the Court
                    has no jurisdiction.

                    pute between the Parties on the basis of allegations of conduct by Colom-
                    bia that occurred before the filing of the Application. And it is right today
                    in asserting that it can consider facts and events subsequent to the Appli-
                    cation provided those events do not transform the nature of the dispute.
                    But what the Court has been unable to do is articulate a justification for
                    finding responsibility on the basis of events that occurred after title of
                    jurisdiction has lapsed.

                      15. There are no doubt policy implications of not taking jurisdiction
                    over events subsequent to the lapse of title. Could a State by withdrawing
                    acceptance of jurisdiction after a case has been filed against it undermine
                    the ability of the Court to deal with the case? While that is certainly an
                    undesirable consequence, it is not the case here. This is not the case of a

                    against it. Rather, it is a case of an applicant waiting to the last minute
                    before jurisdiction expired to bring the claim.


                      16. Equally, there are contrary policy considerations. The principle
                    that international jurisdiction is based on consent is fundamental and the
                    Court should not facilitate bypassing that principle. But that is the conse-
                    quence here. A State that has been unable to substantiate a case on the
                    basis of events that existed at the time of the application when the Court
                    had jurisdiction is being permitted to bypass a jurisdictional impediment
                    and responsibility is found on the basis of events which could not be the


                       17. In my view, the Court has provided no justification for finding
                    responsibility on the basis of events that have occurred after the title of
                    jurisdiction has lapsed. As a result, I would have found that the Court
                    lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over the events in this case that occurred
                    after 27 November 2013.

                                                        III.

                       18. I turn now to Colombia’s contested actions in Nicaragua’s EEZ.
                    With one exception (Judgment, paras. 71‑72) the actions on which the
                    Court relies to establish Colombia’s responsibility occurred after the lapse

                    approach of the Court has not been to reach a conclusion on the basis of
                    each specific incident, but rather to base responsibility on an accumula-
                    tion of incidents, it is unlikely that the Court would have been able to
                    conclude that Colombia’s international responsibility for the alleged inci-
                    dents in Nicaragua’s EEZ was engaged if that incident had stood alone.
                    The facts are contested by the Parties and there is no basis on the evi-
                    dence before the Court for choosing whose allegations are correct. Indeed,
                    as Judge Nolte points out in his dissenting opinion, the Court does not
                    even include this incident among those purporting to show that Colom-
                    bian naval vessels were seeking to exercise enforcement jurisdiction in
                    Nicaragua’s EEZ (ibid., para. 92).


                      19. In other words, the Court was able to conclude that Nicaragua had
                    substantiated its claim in respect of the alleged incidents in Nicaragua’s
                    EEZ only because it relied on post‑27 November 2013 incidents, over
                    which the Court lacked jurisdiction.
                      20. However, even if the Court’s decision to rely on events that
                    occurred after the lapse of jurisdiction were correct, in my view the inci-
                    dents on which the Court does base its conclusion on responsibility do
                    not warrant the decision of the Court that Colombia was
                          “interfering with fishing activities and marine scientific research of
                          Nicaraguan‑flagged or Nicaraguan‑licensed vessels and with the oper-

                          zone and . . . purporting to enforce conservation measures in that
                          zone” (ibid., para. 101).

                       21. As pointed out, this conclusion of the Court was not based on an
                    assessment of each incident individually, but rather the Court reached a
                    global conclusion in the light of all incidents. There are two important
                    components to the Court’s conclusion. First, the Court said that the inci-
                    dents all took place in the area of Luna Verde, east of the 82nd meridian,
                    within Nicaragua’s EEZ (ibid., para. 91). Second, the Court stated that in
                    a number of instances Colombian naval officers read statements to vessels
                    which they approached in the Nicaraguan EEZ, calling on them to dis-

                    illegal or unauthorized (ibid., para. 92). The statements of these naval
                    officers, it is said, also described the area as “Colombian jurisdictional
                    waters” and said that the 2012 Judgment was “not applicable”. In light of
                    this, and of statements of Colombian government authorities, the Court





7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 352                                                                             10/09/23 09:40


                    concludes that the evidence “sufficiently proves that the conduct of
                    Colombian naval vessels was carried out to give effect to a policy whereby
                    Colombia sought to continue to control fishing activities and the conser-
                    vation of resources in the area that lies within Nicaragua’s exclusive eco-
                    nomic zone” (Judgment, para. 92).



                       22. The nature of the activities that the Court concludes violate the
                    rights of Nicaragua in its EEZ are described by the Court as “exercising

                    implementing conservation measures on Nicaraguan‑flagged or Nicara-
                    guan‑licensed ships, and hindering the operations of Nicaragua’s naval
                    vessels” (ibid., para. 100).

                       23. This might be compared with what actually happened in the inci-
                    dents that the Court relies on. The Court refers to incidents in which
                    there was an interaction between the Nicaraguan coast guard and a
                    Colombian naval vessel and an incident involving a marine scientific
                    research vessel. In each of those cases the facts are disputed, and the
                    Court does not draw any conclusion about which Party’s factual allega-
                    tions are to be accepted. Although the Court says that the presence of

                    tion was not presence of the vessels; rather, it was the conduct alleged to
                    have occurred.
                       24. The predominant factual circumstances in the incidents identified
                    by the Court involve Colombian naval vessels confronting Nicaraguan
                    fishing vessels. While the incidents show that Colombian naval vessels did
                    approach Nicaraguan or other non‑Colombian‑flagged vessels and made
                    the statements attributed to them, in no case was there any evidence that
                    the Colombian authorities attempted to arrest fishing vessels or prosecute
                    individuals for violation of Colombian laws. The only evidence that might
                    be regarded as attempted enforcement are the instances where it is alleged
                    that a Colombian vessel chased a fishing vessel away and the intervention

                    arrested a vessel for allegedly illegal fishing (ibid., paras. 71, 77 and 89).
                    But the facts of these incidents, too, are contested both as to whether the
                    arrested vessels had been fishing in Nicaragua’s EEZ and the events that
                    were alleged to have taken place (ibid., paras. 72, 78 and 90). Indeed, in
                    most instances the warning statements of the Colombian naval officers,
                    on which the Court relies, were simply ignored. The Nicaraguan fishing
                    vessels continued their fishing.



                      25. Colombia’s argument in support of the actions of its naval vessels is






7 CIJ1243_Ord.indb 354                                                                               10/09/23 09:40

                    to be a right incidental to freedom of navigation 4. Colombia argued fur-
                    ther that there were responsibilities resulting from the particular environ-

                    Cartagena Convention and the SPAW Protocol (Judgment, para. 54). The
                    Court rightly points out that neither of these instruments grants authority
                    to a State to enforce its own environmental measures in the EEZ of
                    another State (ibid., paras. 98‑99). However, that does not mean that the
                    particular environmental circumstances in the south‑western Caribbean or
                    the regional arrangements encouraging the protection of the environment
                    should be ignored in assessing the actions of States in the area. A claim to
                    monitoring activities that might harm the environment has added legiti-
                    macy in areas where there is a regional concern about the environment.

                       26. Ultimately, the Court rests its conclusion of violation by Colombia
                    on a perception of an intent by Colombia to control fishing and enforce
                    its own national environmental laws in Nicaragua’s EEZ. The Court
                    never defines what it means by control or enforcement. Definitions of
                    enforcement generally refer to the exercise of State authority to apply
                    criminal law through arrest, detention, trial and punishment 5. Yet, there
                    were no actions of control or enforcement such as arrests, detention or
                    prosecution. The perception of an intent to control and enforce is based
                    less on what was done in fact by Colombian vessels but rather on infer-
                    ences drawn from statements read by Colombian naval officers and state-
                    ments of Colombian officials who argued that the 2012 Judgment was

                    concludes, there was “a policy whereby Colombia sought to continue to
                    control fishing activities and the conservation of resources in the area that
                    lies within Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone” (Judgment, para. 92). In

                    443 	  sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. mcrae)

                    my view, this is a thin reed on which to base international responsibility
                    and I do not find the reasoning of the Court compelling.

                       27. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Colombian naval vessels did
                    approach Nicaraguan‑licensed fishing vessels in the Nicaraguan EEZ and
                    did notify them that they were fishing illegally and that they were in waters
                    subject to Colombian jurisdiction (e.g. Judgment, paras. 75‑76 and 81‑84).
                    And this was done without advising Nicaragua, either before or after the
                    event, that its flag vessels, or vessels authorized by it, were being approached
                    and information was being provided to them. Colombia claims that its
                    vessels were doing this in exercise of their right of navigation in those
                    waters, pursuant to their customary international law right reflected in
                    Article 58 of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (herein­
                    after “UNCLOS”) and in the broader interests of promoting the protection

                    was a proper exercise of that customary international law right, such a
                    right has to be exercised, having due regard to the rights and duties of the
                    coastal State.

                       28. This, in my view, is the approach that the Court should have taken
                    in this case. Instead of elevating what occurred into some kind of policy
                    by Colombia to control fishing and enforce its own environmental laws in
                    Nicaragua’s EEZ, the Court should have focused on what was actually
                    done, that is, monitoring the activities of Nicaraguan‑licensed fishing vessels
                    and informing them when it believed that they were fishing by environ-
                    mentally harmful or illegal methods. Since Colombia had done this with-

                    view, evidence of a failure to have due regard for the rights and duties of
                    Nicaragua as the coastal State in exercising its own jurisdiction over
                    the marine environment. It is also in disregard of Nicaragua’s rights in its
                    EEZ for Colombia naval vessels to advise fishing vessels, erroneously,
                    that these are waters subject to Colombia’s jurisdiction, or to make gra-
                    tuitous statements about Colombia rejecting the Court’s 2012 Judgment.
                    These are the matters on which the Court should have focused, instead of
                    drawing a sweeping conclusion about a Colombian policy to control fish-
                    ing and enforce its own environmental laws in Nicaragua’s EEZ.


                      29. A statement by the Court that Colombia was acting without due
                    regard for Nicaragua’s EEZ rights and that it should cease from doing so
                    would have been a much more appropriate solution to this aspect of the
                    case than what the Court has in fact done in its decision on the alleged
                    incidents in Nicaragua’s EEZ.


                    444 	  sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. mcrae)

                                                         IV.

                        30. I turn now to the allegation of Nicaragua that Colombia has
                     granted permits for fishing in Nicaragua’s EEZ. I have voted against the
                     Court’s conclusion that Colombia has authorized its nationals and for-
                    eign nationals to fish in Nicaragua’s EEZ.
                        31. There are three bases on which Nicaragua’s claim rests. First, Nica-
                    ragua asserts that resolutions issued by the General Maritime Directorate

                    included waters within Nicaragua’s EEZ as areas where Nicaraguan‑­
                    licensed vessels were permitted to operate. Second, Nicaragua claims that
                    the Governor of the Department of the Archipelago of San Andrés,
                    ­Providencia and San Catalina also issued resolutions permitting vessels to
                     operate in the Luna Verde areas within Nicaragua’s EEZ. Third, ­Nicaragua
                     identifies certain incidents at sea involving Colombian naval vessels which,
                     it argues, reinforce that Colombia was licensing vessels to fish in Nicara-
                     gua’s EEZ (Judgment, paras. 103‑105).


                      32. The Court does not appear to draw any conclusions from these

                    fact the preamble to the Governor’s resolutions, “suggests that Colombia
                    continues to assert the right to authorize fishing activities in parts of
                    Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone” (ibid., para. 119). But the Court
                    does not address the argument of Colombia that neither DIMAR nor the
                    Governor had authority to issue fishing permits, a matter that was not
                    contradicted on the evidence by Nicaragua.

                       33. The result is that the only real grounds the Court has for its con-
                    clusion that Colombia had issued permits to vessels to fish in Nicaragua’s
                    EEZ are the alleged incidents at sea (ibid., paras. 121‑130). In this regard,
                    it should be noted that none of these incidents occurred before 27 Novem-

                    Thus, to the extent that the Court relies on these incidents to establish
                    responsibility, it is again finding responsibility on the basis of events that
                    occurred after the Court’s title of jurisdiction lapsed.

                       34. Even so, as proof that Colombia issued permits to license fishing
                    vessels within Nicaragua’s jurisdiction, this evidence is at best problem-
                    atic. There is no direct evidence of actual licences, and the Court can only
                    draw inferences from what was reported as having been said. What the
                    evidence does show is that Colombian naval vessels were in the area
                    where at least some of the alleged incidents took place and engaged in
                    communications with fishing vessels and the Nicaraguan coast guard. But

                    authorities, it really lacks any probative value.

                    445 	  sovereign rights and maritime spaces (diss. op. mcrae)

                       35. The engagement between the Colombian naval vessels and Nicara-
                    gua’s coast guard in these incidents was not cited by the Court in its con-
                    sideration of incidents at sea in support of the Nicaraguan claim that
                    Colombia had violated its rights in its EEZ, although that would seem to
                    have been a more appropriate place to consider those incidents. In that
                    context, rather than showing a violation of Nicaragua’s rights within its
                    EEZ, these incidents would have justified the Court cautioning Colombia
                    to exercise its rights within Nicaragua’s EEZ with due regard to the rights
                    and duties of the coastal State as required by Article 58 of the Conven-
                    tion. That, in my view, would have been a more appropriate disposition
                    of these incidents than using them as an indirect way of concluding that



                                                        V.

                      36. With respect to Colombia’s creation of its ICZ, I agree with the
                    Court that Colombia has the right to establish a contiguous zone off the
                    coasts of the islands of the San Andrés Archipelago notwithstanding any
                    overlap with the EEZ of Nicaragua (Judgment, para. 163). As I pointed
                    out earlier, I also agree with the Court that Colombia was not entitled to
                    “simplify” the outer limits of its contiguous zone so that it extended more
                    than 24 nautical miles from the Colombian coast (ibid., para. 175).

                       37. However, I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the ICZ as
                    established in Presidential Decree 1946 is not in conformity with custom-
                    ary international law (ibid., para. 187). I also disagree with the Court’s
                    conclusion that the “expanded powers” asserted in Colombia’s ICZ
                    directly infringe on the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Nicaragua
                    with regard to the conservation, protection and preservation of the marine
                    environment in Nicaragua’s EEZ (ibid., para. 178).


                       38. The objection the Court has is to Article 5 (3) of the Decree, which
                    deals with the material scope of the zone. In the view of the Court, it

                    its laws and regulations that extend to matters which are not permitted
                    under customary international law. The Court’s conclusion is based on its
                    position that the content of customary international law relating to the
                    contiguous zone is found in Article 33 of UNCLOS, and that Colombia’s
                    so‑called “expanded powers” are not included in Article 33 (ibid.,
                    para. 155). The so‑called “expanded powers” of Colombia expressed in
                    Article 5 of Decree 1946, as modified by Article 2 of Decree 1119 of 2014,
                    that the Court found to be outside the scope of the rule reflected in Arti-
                    cle 33 of UNCLOS, are laws and regulations related to the integral secu-
                    rity of the State, including piracy and trafficking of drugs and
                    psychotropic substances, conduct contrary to the security of the sea and

                       39. The categories specified in Article 33 of UNCLOS are “customs,

                    of UNCLOS so that today they can be said to cover the categories of
                    laws identified by Colombia. Essentially, the question is whether the secu-
                    rity claims of Colombia and the claim relating to the preservation of the
                    marine environment fall within contiguous zone jurisdiction under Arti-
                    cle 33 of UNCLOS.
                       40. As the Court points out, the provisions of Article 33 of UNCLOS
                    were adopted in the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contigu-
                    ous Zone, on the basis of the 1956 work of the International Law Com-

                    unchanged since then (ibid., para. 153). They were then endorsed without
                    change in UNCLOS. A proposal in 1958 to add security to the categories
                    in Article 33 ultimately did not get support 7. The question, then, is
                    whether, notwithstanding what happened in 1958 and in the UNCLOS
                    negotiations, there is a case today for seeing security and the preservation
                    of the marine environment as matters that fall within the scope of Arti-
                    cle 33 of UNCLOS.

                       41. An alternative to seeing the terms of Article 33 of UNCLOS as
                    static that must be interpreted in the light of the world of 1956 might have
                    led the Court to a different conclusion. The specific claim to including

                    perception of both customs and fiscal laws. Drug trafficking is as much an
                    issue of customs laws as was the smuggling of alcohol whose prosecution
                    was one of the matters covered by the United States’ “hovering acts”
                    which laid the basis for the contiguous zone 8. Equally, sanitary laws in
                    1958, and still today, concern health. Not seeing the preservation of the
                    environment as an issue that is fundamentally linked to health is also to
                    ignore the reality of today.


                      42. The justification for seeing contiguous zone jurisdiction in contem-
                    porary terms is in fact found in the ILC Commentary to what became

                        6 I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the inclusion of the exercise of control

                    with respect to archeological and cultural objects found within the EEZ does not violate
                    customary international law (Judgment, para. 186).

                    Article 24 of the 1958 Convention and Article 33 of UNCLOS. The Court
                    quotes the relevant part of the Commentary (Judgment, para. 152) but
                    does not draw the necessary inference from it. In the relevant extract

                    security rights in the draft provisions relating to the contiguous zone,
                    indicating the term was vague and could lead to abuses and thus was not
                    necessary. It then goes on to make the critical statement: “The enforce-
                    ment of customs and sanitary regulations will be sufficient in most cases
                    to safeguard the security of the State.” (Commentary to the articles con-
                    cerning the law of the sea, Yearbook of the International Law Commission,
                    1956, Vol. II, p. 295, draft Article 66, Comment (4), quoted in Judgment,
                    para. 152.)
                       43. What the ILC statement shows is that the Commission thought
                    that it was adequately dealing with contemporary issues of security. And
                    this reinforces the view that the purpose of the contiguous zone was pre-

                    sider that what was adequate to safeguard the security concerns of States
                    at the time of the Commentary in 1956 would necessarily parallel contem-
                    porary security needs. An assessment of the security needs of States today
                    might well include the suppression of the drug trade and the protection of
                    the marine environment. Indeed, at a time of heightened concern about
                    the impact of climate change, the protection of the marine environment
                    might be seen for some States as their primary security concern. More-
                    over, the last 20 years have shown that piracy, which might have been
                    dealt with adequately under international law in 1956, has been posing an
                    increasing problem for States in certain regions, including in their territo-
                    rial seas. It is not surprising then that a State might wish to act in its

                    when piracy has occurred within its territorial sea. Indeed, the fact that a
                    significant number of States have inserted a right to include certain secu-
                    rity needs among the matters over which they will exercise contiguous
                    zone jurisdiction is testament to a change in contemporary security needs
                    of States 9.



                       44. It must be recalled that contiguous zone jurisdiction only enables
                    States to act to prevent and punish in respect of offences committed
                    within the territory of a State or in its territorial sea, namely, offences that

                    coastal States to prevent or punish in respect of offences committed
                    within the contiguous zone or beyond.
                       45. It is the failure to recognize this that has led the Court to its con-
                    clusion that the powers asserted under Colombia’s ICZ directly infringe

                     on the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Nicaragua with respect to the
                     conservation, protection and preservation of the marine environment in
                     Nicaragua’s EEZ (Judgment, para. 187). But, as the Court points out
                     earlier in its Judgment, the contiguous zone and the EEZ deal with differ-
                    ent things (ibid., paras. 160‑161). Nicaragua certainly has jurisdiction
                    over the preservation of the marine environment in its EEZ. And it has

                    ritory of Colombia or in Colombia’s territorial sea. By the same token,
                    Colombia, while having jurisdiction within its contiguous zone to prevent
                    and punish in respect of offences in certain categories of matters within its
                    territory and its territorial sea, has no jurisdiction on the basis of its
                    ­contiguous zone to prevent or punish in respect of offences committed in
                     Nicaragua’s EEZ. And since Nicaragua’s EEZ does not overlap Col­
                     ombia’s territorial sea, there is no potential for overlapping ­     jurisd­
                                                                                                -
                     iction.

                       46. Nor does Colombia claim jurisdiction over offences within Nicara-

                    clear. It says that Colombia has authority in its contiguous zone to pre-
                    vent infractions of its laws relating to the integral security of the State
                    “which take place in its insular territories or in their territorial sea”
                    (Art. 5 (3) (a) of Decree 1946, as amended by Decree 1119, quoted in
                    Judgment, para. 170). And it goes on to say that “[i]n the same manner”
                    violations of the laws relating to the preservation of the environment will
                    be prevented and controlled (ibid.). “In the same manner” can only mean
                    that the authority asserted in respect of the environment is no different
                    than the authority asserted in respect of security. And in respect of
                    the other element of contiguous zone jurisdiction, the power to punish,
                    the Decree states that it relates to the above-­mentioned matters “commit-

                    ree 1946, as amended by Decree 1119, quoted in Judgment, para. 170).



                       47. None of this involves a claim to exercise jurisdiction in respect of
                    offences committed in the contiguous zone itself or in the EEZ of Nicara-
                    gua. Thus, the regulation adopted by Colombia makes no claim to
                    “ensure their implementation in part of Nicaragua’s exclusive economic
                    zone” as asserted by the Court (ibid., para. 178). Colombia’s claim in
                    respect of the prevention of the environment is no different than its claim
                    in respect of customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary rights — that is, to

                    tory or in its territorial sea.

                      48. In my view, this was an appropriate case for the Court to interpret
                    Article 33 of UNCLOS in an evolutionary manner. Evolutionary (or evo-

                    lutive) interpretation has been accepted in the jurisprudence of the
                    Court 10. A provision which, in 1956, the ILC saw as its purpose to pro-
                    tect the security needs of States must be interpreted today in a way that
                    reflects contemporary security needs. On this basis, all of the matters
                    identified in Colombia’s Presidential Decree 1946 reflect contemporary
                    security needs of some if not all States — piracy, suppression of the drug
                    trade, maritime security and the protection of the (marine) environ-
                    ment — and thus should be seen as legitimate matters to be covered under
                    the contiguous zone jurisdiction of States.



                                                               VI.

                      49. I turn now to Colombia’s two counter‑claims, (A) Traditional and
                    artisanal fishing rights and (B) Straight baselines. I disagree with the
                    Court’s findings in respect of each counter‑claim.



                                                                A.

                    the eighth subparagraph of the operative clause because I do not agree
                    with the Court that
                          “Colombia has failed to establish that the inhabitants of the
                          San Andrés Archipelago, in particular the Raizales, enjoy artisanal
                          fishing rights in waters now located in Nicaragua’s exclusive economic
                          zone, or that Nicaragua has, through the unilateral statements of its
                          Head of State, accepted or recognized their traditional fishing rights,
                          or legally undertaken to respect them” (Judgment, para. 231).

                       51. In my view, the Court has failed to address what is a critical, and
                    to some extent unique, aspect of Colombia’s counter‑claim and this has

                    traditional fishing rights and viewed the statements of Nicaragua’s Presi-
                    dent.
                       52. Colombia’s third counter‑claim relating to traditional or artisanal
                    fishing rights was articulated by Colombia in a number of different ways.
                    It was referred to as a claim in respect of the inhabitants of the San Andrés

                    or the “traditional, historic fishing rights of the Raizales and the other

                    mulations is that they identify two groups: the Raizales, and the other
                    inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago. The Raizales are included
                    within the inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago but are also seen as
                    distinct from the other inhabitants of the Archipelago.
                       53. In its Counter‑Memorial, Colombia identified the Raizales as
                    “descendants of the enslaved Africans and the original Dutch, British and
                    Spanish settlers” which “have acquired through the centuries their own
                    specific culture” 14. The Counter‑Memorial also claims that “[s]ince time
                    immemorial, they [the Raizales] have navigated all of the Southwestern
                    Caribbean in search of resources, such as fish and turtles” 15.
                       54. While Nicaragua’s pleadings refer to the fishing practices of the

                    Raizal people” 16 and on another occasion simply “the Raizal people” 17,
                    their pleadings tend to treat the inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipel-
                    ago as a single group. The main argument of Nicaragua is that traditional
                    or artisanal rights did not survive the creation of the EEZ 18 and, thus,
                    regardless of any claim to traditional or artisanal fishing, no such right
                    exists within the EEZ. In Nicaragua’s pleadings no independent
                    right exists for the Raizales, but rather the rights that are claimed by
                    Colombia are rights in respect of all of the inhabitants of the San Andrés
                    Archipelago.
                       55. Having described the origins of the Raizales and the fact that they
                    had fished in the south-­western Caribbean for centuries, Colombia chara­

                    says, a “distinct ethnic and cultural community” who “navigated, traded
                    and fished in this area of the Southwestern Caribbean Sea before and
                    after the coming into existence of Nicaragua and Colombia as indepen-
                    dent States” 20.
                       56. In describing the Raizales in this way, Colombia is clearly creating
                    a category that is separate from other claimants to traditional or artisanal
                    fishing rights. The way that Colombia articulates this claim for the Raiza-
                    les as a separate and distinct group and in particular the reference to the
                    Raizales as “indigenous fishermen” suggests an analogy with indigenous

                          “(i) communal attachments to ‘place’; (ii) historical precedence over
                          dominant societies; (iii) experience of severe disruption, dislocation
                          and exploitation; (iv) ‘historical continuity’; (v) ongoing oppression/
                          exclusion by dominant societal groups; (vi) distinct ethnic/cultural
                          groups; and (vii) self-­identification as an indigenous community” 22.

                    It has been argued that not all of the indicia are necessary in order to
                    establish entitlement to indigenous rights 23. In any event, it is clear that
                    the attribution of the terms “indigenous” to a people is a potentially com-

                    Raizales are properly termed “indigenous” but, as described by Colombia
                    in its pleadings, the Raizales clearly meet many of the above indicia sug-
                    gesting that at the very least an analogy with indigenous rights is appro-
                    priate.

                      58. Treating the situation of the Raizales as akin to that of indigenous
                    peoples finds indirect support in the position of Nicaragua in the plead-
                    ings in this case and direct support in the statements of President Ortega.
                    Although Nicaragua’s pleadings assimilate the Raizales to the other
                    inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago, they refer to the Raizales as
                    “Raizal people” reinforcing a separateness from those other inhabitants


                      59. President Ortega has consistently used language that emphasizes
                    the analogy of the Raizales with indigenous peoples. Shortly after the
                    2012 Judgment of the Court was delivered, President Ortega spoke of the
                    “Raizal brethren” and of being respectful of “the Principle of Native Peo-
                    ples” and of respect for their right to fish and navigate where they have
                    historically navigated 24. He later spoke of the “historical rights” of the
                       21 United Nations General Assembly resolution 61/295 “United Nations Declara-

                    tion on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples” (adopted on 13 September 2007), UN doc. A/

                    Raizal people 25. He also spoke of the rights of the Raizal people as rights

                    not just the language of traditional or artisanal fishing rights.

                       60. Furthermore, President Ortega spoke of allowing the rights of the
                    Raizales to “continue”, and of “ensur[ing]” those rights 27. The context
                    clearly shows that what was being assured was the continuation of exist-
                    ing rights, not the creation of new rights where none had existed before.
                    President Ortega’s proposal for a “commission” was for a body to ensure
                    the orderly continuation of existing Raizal fishing. It was to help locate
                    “where the [R]aizal people can fish in exercise of their historic rights” 28.
                    It was not a commission that would create a new right to fish.

                       61. In short, when viewed from the perspective of Raizal rights as the
                    rights of a specific group with a strong analogy to indigenous rights, then
                    President Ortega’s statements have much more meaning. They are not
                    just an expression about claims of the inhabitants of the San Andrés
                    Archipelago to traditional or artisanal fishing. Nor can they be explained
                    away as President Ortega wanting to be diplomatic or avoiding contro-
                    versy and appeasing Colombia 29. They are a recognition and validation
                    of the claims of a particular community of “original peoples” to continue
                    fishing as they had in the past.

                    enous rights has certain consequences for the conclusions reached by the
                    Court. The Court assesses the statements of President Ortega in terms of
                    whether they could constitute recognition of traditional or artisanal fish-
                    ing rights or of a right to fish without prior authorization (Judgment,
                    para. 227). The Court also considers whether President Ortega’s state-
                    ments constituted a unilateral declaration undertaking legal obligations
                    (ibid., paras. 228‑230). But a more appropriate focus would have been to
                    consider what President Ortega was saying about the Raizales. He called
                    them “original people”, “native people”, and spoke of their “ancestral
                    rights”. The traditional fishing rights of the Raizales that he spoke of,

                    were rights that flowed from their status as Raizal people. This is evi-
                    denced clearly when President Ortega argues for a commission to delimit

                    already have a permanent permit there, they do not have to be going for
                    a permit every day, why? Because they are in their lands, they are in their
                    waters, they are in their natural habitat.” 30 In short, for President Ortega,
                    the right to a fishery was an inherent consequence of who the Raizal peo-
                    ple were. Their fishing in what were now Nicaragua’s waters was their
                    right because it was in “their lands”, in “their waters”. It was, Presi-
                    dent Ortega said, the Raizales “natural habitat” 31.

                       63. The language and imagery President Ortega used is consistent with
                    indigenous rights. And his statements should also be considered against
                    the background of the jurisprudence of the Inter‑American Court of

                    peoples” have rights to the natural resources that they have traditionally
                    used 32. In light of such developments in the Inter‑American Court, it is
                    not surprising that a president of a Latin American country would refer
                    to the Raizales in the language that President Ortega used.
                       64. The fishing rights of indigenous peoples are recognized in the
                    United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Arti-
                    cle 26, paragraph 1, provides: “Indigenous peoples have the right to the
                    lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned,
                    occupied or otherwise used or acquired.” 33 This clearly covers indigenous
                    fishing rights.
                       65. However, the Court concludes that Colombia has not established

                    This conclusion is based on a rejection of affidavit evidence of fishers pro-
                    vided by Colombia. But this is problematic in two ways. First, the stan-
                    dard the Court set for establishing traditional fishing rights is essentially
                    one that could never be reached. Second, the Court failed to see the link
                    between what was claimed in respect of the Raizales and what was said
                    about them, and about their right to fish in Nicaragua’s EEZ.

                       66. With regard to the assessment of affidavit evidence, as the Court
                    itself notes, it is unrealistic to expect that evidence of what happened cen-
                    turies ago can be gleaned from the affidavits of contemporary fishers, par-

                    therefore that the Court concluded that the affidavit evidence had nothing
                    to say about the location of fishing of the Raizales some two hundred
                    years ago (Judgment, para. 221).

                       67. But if the claims in respect of the Raizales were seen as analogous
                    to claims to indigenous rights then a different approach must be taken. In
                    this regard, the Court failed to appreciate the import of what Presi-
                    dent Ortega said. All of President Ortega’s statements were about the
                    right of the Raizales to engage in fishing in Nicaragua’s EEZ. For Presi-
                    dent Ortega it went without saying that the original peoples, the Raizales,
                    fished within the waters that were now subject to Nicaraguan jurisdiction.


                       68. Viewing the claims of the Raizales as akin to indigenous rights also
                    makes irrelevant another part of the Court’s reasoning, that relating to
                    the position taken by the Ministry of Labour of the Colombian
                    Government in a complaint brought before the International Labour
                    ­
                    Organization relating to the impact of the 2012 Judgment on the Raizales
                    and other fishers of the San Andrés Archipelago (ibid., paras. 222‑223).
                    The rights of the Raizales that President Ortega was referring to are
                    not rights that can be abandoned by a department of a government seek-
                    ing to protect the reputation of its government in another international

                       69. In my view, the Court has failed to appreciate the real nature of the
                    claim relating to the Raizales in respect of the third counter‑claim. It has
                    reached a conclusion that does not accord with the entitlement of the
                    Raizales as reflected in the words of President Ortega — that the Raizales
                    had fished in waters that were now within the Nicaraguan EEZ and that,
                    by virtue of their particular status as “original peoples”, they were enti-
                    tled to continue that fishing. All that was needed was an arrangement
                    between Nicaragua and Colombia to ensure the effective implementation
                    of that right to continue fishing.
                       70. In paragraph 232, the Court supports the negotiation of an agreement
                    between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding access by the Raizales com-

                    out the Raizales specifically and does not speak of an agreement for all the
                    inhabitants of the San Andrés Archipelago is a clear indication that the Court
                    was at least implicitly treating the Raizales as a distinct group. The negotia-
                    tion of an agreement is an important step, but it is unfortunate that the Court
                    did not couple this recommendation with an affirmation of the rights that
                    the Raizales have. The purpose of such an agreement should not be to grant
                    rights to the Raizales. Rather, an agreement would, as President Ortega
                    anticipated, provide the modalities to ensure that the Raizales could continue

                    to exercise their right to a resource that they had traditionally fished but
                    which as a result of the 2012 Judgment was now in Nicaragua’s EEZ.

                                                              B.
                       71. I have voted against the Court’s conclusion that Nicaragua’s
                    straight baselines do not conform with customary international law. I did

                    alized application of the law relating to drawing straight baselines and
                    ignored State practice which should have been taken into account in
                    interpreting the relevant provisions of customary international law.

                       72. The Court notes that the Parties accept that Article 7 of UNCLOS
                    reflects customary international law on drawing straight baselines and
                    concludes itself that this is so (Judgment, paras. 241‑242). As result, the
                    issue before the Court is whether Nicaragua’s straight baselines meet the
                    requirements of Article 7.
                       73. In interpreting Article 7, the Court focuses on the criteria in para-
                    graph 1 of that Article that straight baselines can apply in localities where

                    “fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity”. In respect of
                    Nicaragua’s baseline between points 8 and 9 the Court asks whether the
                    coast in the area meets the requirement of being “deeply indented and cut
                    into” (ibid., para. 245). The baselines between points 1 and 8 are tested by
                    reference to whether there is a “fringe of islands” along the coast (ibid.,
                    para. 247).

                       74. The terms of Article 7 are essentially a direct reflection of what was
                    said in the 1951 Judgment in the Fisheries (United Kingdom v. Norway)
                    case 34. Thus, the terms constitute a description of the coasts of Norway
                    as perceived in that Judgment. The difficulty is how to apply these terms

                    for the Court was to give meaning to the terms “deeply indented and cut
                    into” or “fringe of islands” along the coast that can be readily applied to
                    the coastal configurations in this case and can be used as guidance for
                    States in applying Article 7 to their own coastlines.

                       75. Unfortunately, I do not consider that the Court has done this. It
                    has taken the idea expressed in the language of “deeply indented and cut
                    into” and applied it by saying that the coastal indentations of the Nicara-
                    gua coast “do not penetrate sufficiently inland or present characteristics

                    sufficient for the Court to consider the said portion as ‘deeply indented
                    and cut into’” (Judgment, para. 245). Resorting to the language of the
                    1951 Judgment, the Court refers to requirements of the coast being of a
                    “very distinctive configuration” or not “broken along its length”, or
                    indentations “often penetrating great distances inland” (ibid.). None of
                    this is any more precise than the phrase “deeply indented or cut into” of
                    Article 7. The impression left is that the conclusion is based not on clear
                    criteria but on a subjective impression of what “deeply indented and cut
                    into” means.

                       76. The same applies to the Court’s treatment of the term “fringe of
                    islands”. The Court notes that in its 2012 Judgment it had referred to
                    islands off Nicaragua’s coast as “fringing islands”, but states that it did
                    not do so as an interpretation of Article 7 (ibid., para. 249). The fact that
                    it had used the term “fringe of islands” apparently to mean something
                    different from the term “fringe of islands” in Article 7, should itself have
                    alerted the Court to the perils of trying to apply the term. The closest the
                    Court comes to elucidating the meaning of a “fringe of islands” is when it
                    says that “the phrase ‘fringe of islands’ implies that there should not be
                    too small a number of such islands relative to the length of coast” (ibid.,
                    para. 252) and when it says, “a ‘fringe’ must enclose a set, or cluster of

                    continuity” (ibid., para. 254). But while such statements can provide an
                    image of what the Court is seeking to establish, the link between them
                    and the Court’s conclusion that it “is not satisfied . . . that the number of
                    Nicaragua’s islands . . . is sufficient to constitute a ‘fringe of islands’ along
                    Nicaragua’s coast” (ibid., para. 252) or that they “are not sufficiently
                    close to each other to form a coherent ‘cluster’ or a ‘chapelet’ along the
                    coast and are not sufficiently linked to the land domain” (ibid., para. 256)
                    is simply not evident. In elaborating on the requirements for a fringe of
                    islands the Court also refers to islands having “a masking effect” (ibid.,
                    para. 254), but this is as imprecise as the terms to which it is supposed to
                    give content.


                      77. What is missing from the Court’s analysis is a treatment of State
                    practice in drawing straight baselines. The imprecision of the terms in
                    Article 7 might well be lessened by considering how States in practice
                    have interpreted and applied those provisions. There are many examples
                    of State practice in drawing straight baselines, including the practice of
                    Colombia itself 36. And when viewed against that practice, the straight
                    baselines of Nicaragua do not seem to be out of line with the way States
                    are interpreting Article 7. It is true that straight baselines are sometimes

                    rare. There is simply no widespread objection by States to the way straight
                    baselines have been drawn 37. Only one State has consistently objected to
                    straight baselines, reflecting its own view of what is appropriate. In light
                    of this, it might have been prudent for the Court to have been guided by
                    what States have been doing when establishing straight baselines.


                       78. In short, what the Court has done is measure Nicaragua’s baselines
                    against an impression created by the words in Article 7, rather than giv-
                    ing concrete content to the words that would reduce subjectivity and pro-
                    vide guidance not only on how the conclusion was reached in this case

                    Article 7. And this has been done without reference to State practice. Yet
                    there is significant State practice which can throw light on how Article 7
                    has been interpreted and, if taken into account, would lead to a contrary
                    conclusion.
                       79. Ultimately, in my view, this was not the case for the Court to pro-
                    vide a definitive interpretation of Article 7. It came by way of coun-
                    ter‑claim, not as a principal claim, from a State that itself had drawn
                    straight baselines that do not appear dissimilar from the baselines it is
                    challenging. The case raised questions about how to assess the relevance
                    of scale on the maps used to depict the baselines. It involved challenges to
                    the status of features that were claimed to be islands and to the legitimacy

                    appoint a technical expert who could provide guidance on aspects of the
                    pleadings of the Parties that would have enabled the Court to reach defin-
                    itive conclusions on some of these questions.

                       80. There is no doubt that the law relating to straight baselines is in
                    need of clarification and perhaps the day will come when an appropriate
                    case comes before the Court, where the matter can be considered fully
                    with a complete articulation by the parties of all the issues, and technical
                    support provided for the Court. Unfortunately, that is not this case. I am
                    concerned therefore that what the Court has done will increase uncer-
                    tainty in this area, rather than providing clarification, and will leave

                    baselines meet the requirements of Article 7.
