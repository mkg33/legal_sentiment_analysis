                         Failure of the Court to rule on the merits of the claim that Nicaragua breached
                      the prohibition of the use of force set out in Article 2 (4) of the
                      United Nations Charter — the centrality of that prohibition in the United Nations
                      Charter system for the maintenance of international peace and security — the need
                      for the Court to adopt a practice of ruling on the merits of a claim for a breach of
                      Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, unless the claim is patently
                      unmeritorious or frivolous — the assumption that reparation for a breach of
                      territorial sovereignty sufficiently addresses a breach of the prohibition of the use
                      of force — international law envisages a spectrum of activities that may breach
                      Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter — the finding that in this case a
                      breach of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter has been committed.

                         1. As my votes indicate, I am in broad agreement with the Court’s
                      decision in this case. I write separately to explain my vote against the
                      Court’s rejection in paragraph 229 (7) of all other submissions made by
                      the Parties.
                         2. In its final submissions, 2 (b) (ii), Costa Rica asked the Court to
                      find a breach by Nicaragua of “the prohibition of the threat or use of
                      force under Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and Article 22 of
                      the Charter of the Organization of American States” 1. In its earlier sub-
                      missions, Costa Rica also asked the Court to find Nicaragua responsible
                      for its violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force pursuant
                      to Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, and Articles 1, 19, 21, 22
                      and 29 of the Charter of the Organization of American States 2.

                        3. I am of the opinion that the facts establish Nicaragua’s breach of
                      Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and that in the circumstances
                      of this case the Court should have separately and explicitly determined
                      the claim that there was a breach of that provision. The opinion also
                      argues that the Court should adopt a practice of determining the merits
                      of a claim that Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter has been
                      breached, unless the claim is patently unmeritorious or frivolous. In this

                                              A. The Court’s Approach

                        5. In ruling on Costa Rica’s submissions about the prohibition of the
                      threat or use of force, the Court states the following in paragraph 97 :

                               “The fact that Nicaragua considered that its activities were taking
                            place on its own territory does not exclude the possibility of charac-
                            terizing them as unlawful use of force. This raises the issue of their
                            compatibility with both the United Nations Charter and the Charter
                            of the Organization of American States. However, in the circum-
                            stances, given that the unlawful character of these activities has
                            already been established, the Court need not dwell any further on this
                            submission. As in the case concerning Land and the Maritime Bound‑
                            ary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria : Equatorial
                            Guinea intervening), the Court finds that, ‘by the very fact of the
                            present Judgment and the evacuation’ of the disputed territory, the
                            injury suffered by Costa Rica ‘will in all events have been sufficiently
                            addressed’ (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 452, para. 319).”

                         6. In doing so, the Court follows its approach in Land and Maritime
                      Boundary (Cameroon v. Nigeria). In that case, Cameroon had asked the
                      Court to adjudge and declare that by “invading and occupying its terri-
                      tory”, Nigeria had violated its conventional and customary obligations ;
                      in particular, the prohibition of the use of force, the principle of non‑inter-

                      vention and Cameroon’s territorial sovereignty 3. Cameroon argued that
                      Nigeria was under an obligation to end its presence in Cameroonian ter-
                      ritory, evacuate any occupied areas, refrain from such acts in future, and
                      to make reparation for material and non‑material injury 4. Given the
                      unsettled nature of the boundary, Nigeria argued that it believed its
                      actions were lawful 5.

                         7. The evidence shows that the acts pleaded by Cameroon included at
                      least 80 incidents 6, some of them resulting in loss of life 7 due to active
                      engagements between Cameroonian and Nigerian military forces on
                      Cameroonian territory and arrests by military forces. The alleged acts

                      parts of the territory that were in dispute 8.
                         8. The Court found that, in light of its decision on the boundary
                      between the two States, Nigeria was under an obligation to withdraw its
                      civilian and military presence from occupied areas that the Court had

                         10. The Judgment does not set out in detail the facts which substanti-
                      ate Costa Rica’s claim of a breach of Article 2 (4) of the
                      United Nations Charter. The treatment of this issue is very sparse, being
                      confined to: (i) paragraphs 66 and 67, which mention Nicaragua’s place-
                      ment of military units in the area of Isla Portillos with the indication that
                      the matter would be considered in relation to Nicaragua’s compliance
                      with the Court’s Order on provisional measures, of 8 March 2011;
                      (ii) paragraph 93, where the Court finds that Nicaragua’s activities were a
                      breach of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty; (iii) paragraph 97, in which
                      the Court finds that the injury suffered by Costa Rica will in all events
                      have been sufficiently addressed; (iv) paragraphs 121 to 129, which
                      address the question of Nicaragua’s compliance with provisional mea-
                      sures ; and (v) paragraph 139 and 142, in which the Court deals with rep-
                      aration for certain activities by Nicaragua, are also relevant to the
                      discussion.

                         11. These paragraphs have to be read along with relevant passages
                      from the pleadings of the Parties. The Court has held, in paragraph 67 of
                      the Judgment, that violations that occurred in 2013, although taking
                      place after Costa Rica’s Application was filed, may be examined “as part
                      of the merits of the claim” since “they concern facts which are of the same
                      nature as those covered in the Application and which the Parties had the
                      opportunity to discuss in their pleadings”. As such, they are considered in
                      this opinion.

                         17. On 7 December 2010, Special Adviser to the OAS Secretary‑­
                      General, Ambassador Caputo, after conducting an overflight, reported to
                      the OAS that he “saw no members of the armed forces on the ground”,
                      but went on to say that this “does not necessarily mean that there were
                      none. In contrast, the military presence on board the dredger was
                      obvious.” 19
                         18. During the Court’s January 2011 hearings for Costa Rica’s request
                      for the indication of provisional measures, Costa Rica presented evidence
                      that the Nicaraguan military presence in the disputed territory had
                      increased 20. In this context, counsel for Costa Rica also made reference to
                      alleged Nicaraguan violations of Costa Rica’s territorial waters in the
                      Caribbean Sea and “underline[d] that the inhabitants of the region are
                      extremely worried and scared” 21.

                         19. During its oral pleadings before the Court on 11 January 2011,
                      Nicaragua stated that “there are no troops in the swampland. There is no
                      permanent military post in the area.” 22
                         20. On 19 January 2011, a Costa Rican overflight established that
                      Nicaraguan military personnel continued to be present on the disputed
                      territory and that the size of their encampment had increased since Octo-
                      ber 2010 23.
                         21. The Court, in its Order for provisional measures of 8 March 2011,
                      required both Parties to “refrain from sending to, or maintaining in the
                      disputed territory, including the caño, any personnel, whether civilian,
                      police or security” 24.
                         22. However, about two years later, in a photograph dated 5 Febru-
                      ary 2013 and submitted to the Court on 15 March 2013, a new military
                      camp was visible on the beach 25. On 18 September 2013, a Costa Rican
                      overflight provided further evidence of the Nicaraguan military troops
                      and camps on the beach within the disputed territory 26.

                        23. During Nicaragua’s oral pleadings on 15 and 17 October 2013 in
                      response to Costa Rica’s request for new provisional measures, Nicara-

                      trafficking 27. Nicaragua also pointed out that in its request for new pro-
                      visional measures, Costa Rica did not, again, complain about Nicaraguan
                      military presence 28.

                         24. In its Order of provisional measures of 22 November 2013, the
                      Court found that the photograph dated 5 February 2013 did show a
                      “Nicaraguan army encampment” and that “military personnel” had been
                      stationed there since at least 5 February 2013 29. The Court also held that

                      nine months, Nicaragua had an established military presence on the beach,
                      which is also, as confirmed by the Judgment, Costa Rican territory.

                        27. The prohibition of the threat or use of force is a foundational rule
                      of the international legal system. It has been described by the Court as “a
                      cornerstone of the United Nations Charter” 32. The prohibition has been
                      deemed to “represent . . . beside the protection of human rights, ‘the
                      major achievement of the international legal order in the 20th century . . .

                         28. Up to the end of World War I, and despite early twentieth-century
                      attempts to the contrary, international law did not prohibit the use of
                      force among States. Significantly, the Covenant of the League of Nations
                      did not contain a general prohibition on the use of force. Article 11
                      defined war and the threat of war as a “matter of concern to the whole
                      League”, but only in specific circumstances were States prohibited from
                      resorting to war 34. It was only after Article 1 of the Kellogg‑Briand Pact
                      was adopted in 1928 that “recourse to war” was prohibited. It was
                      renounced “as an instrument of national policy” by the majority of
                      States 35. It took the atrocities of World War II to convince States to
                      agree on the prohibition of force in its modern form. It is found in Arti-

                      follows :


                                “The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes
                            stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Princi-

                            the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
                            independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with
                            the Purposes of the United Nations.”

                        29. The history of the prohibition of the use of force, and in particular,
                      the difficulties encountered by the international community in arriving at
                      agreement on the prohibition, is one indication of its pivotal role in the

                      national peace and security. The centrality of that role is no doubt one of
                      the factors explaining why the prohibition has the status not only of a
                      rule of customary international law, but also of a peremptory norm of

                      general international law from which no derogation is permitted 36. The
                      virtual universal acceptance of this norm through membership of the
                      United Nations also serves to highlight the significance of the prohibition.
                         30. The United Nations Charter also highlights the important role the

                      is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security”
                      and thus undermine the purposes of the United Nations Charter 37. Arti-
                      cle 92 of the United Nations Charter identifies the Court as the principal
                      judicial organ of the United Nations and provides that its Statute —
                      annexed to the United Nations Charter — is an integral part of the
                      United Nations Charter. Article 36 (3) of the United Nations Charter pro-
                      vides that the Security Council “should also take into consideration that
                      legal disputes, as a general rule, be referred by the parties to the Interna-
                      tional Court of Justice”. It is thus clear that the Court is expected, through
                      its judicial function, to contribute to the maintenance of international
                      peace and security. Therefore, the discharge by the Court of its judicial
                      functions is not peripheral to, but is an integral part of the post‑World
                      War II system for the maintenance of international peace and security.
                         31. The law in this area should work to discipline States to refrain
                      from unlawful behaviour. Every State presenting a claim that another

                      patently unmeritorious or frivolous) deserves a decision as to whether, on
                      the basis of the relevant law and facts, that foundational provision has
                      been breached ; equally, the State against whom the claim is made needs
                      to know whether its acts breached Article 2 (4). It is therefore the Court’s
                      responsibility, as the “principal judicial organ of the United Nations”, to
                      take on the sometimes difficult and sensitive task of identifying the con-
                      tours of international law’s prohibition of the use of force 38.


                        36 For example, in the Military and Paramilitary Activities case, the Court noted that

                      Article 2 (4) :
                              “is frequently referred to in statements by State representatives as being not only a prin-
                              ciple of customary international law but also a fundamental or cardinal principle of such

                              the law of treaties, expressed the view that ‘the law of the Charter concerning the prohibi-
                              tion of the use of force in itself constitutes a conspicuous example of a rule in international
                              law having the character of jus cogens’ (paragraph (1) of the commentary of the Commis-

                      never shied away from a case brought before it merely because it had political implications
                      or because it involved serious elements of the use of force.”

                        32. This is a view that has been shared by former Members of the
                      Court. In his separate opinion in Oil Platforms, Judge Simma found it

                            “regrettable that the Court has not mustered the courage of restating,
                            and thus re‑confirming, more fully fundamental principles of the law
                            of the United Nations as well as customary international law (princi-

                            force, or rather the prohibition on armed force, in a context and at
                            a time when such a reconfirmation is called for with the greatest
                            urgency” 39.

                      Uganda) not to rule on the Democratic Republic of Congo’s claim that
                      Uganda’s acts amounted to aggression. In his view, it was part of the
                      Court’s “judicial responsibility” to determine whether Uganda’s acts met
                      the legal standard for aggression 40.

                        In the same case, Judge Simma also wondered why the Court was not
                      prepared to “call a spade a spade” when the Court refrained from making
                      a finding that Uganda’s military activities on Congolese territory were
                      not only violations of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter but also
                      amounted to aggression 41.

                         33. The use of force among States has taken new forms, and entered
                      new arenas, since the San Francisco Conference in 1945. While the prohi-
                      bition of the use of force is a bedrock principle of the international legal

                      asking whether the ambiguity still present in the contours of the prohibi-
                      tion of the use of force damages respect for the norm. If so, this again
                      highlights the importance of the principal judicial organ of the United
                      Nations clarifying the contours of that prohibition when the opportunity
                      arises.
                         34. Consequently, in my view, the Court should only refrain from
                      making an express and discrete finding on a claim that the prohibition of

                      they still conclude that the Court should have been more explicit in its decisions on the use
                      of force (in Oil Platforms) and an act of aggression (in Armed Activities). Their words are
                      relevant in indicating a reluctance of the Court in recent times to determine certain issues
                      relating to the use of force.

                                           D. Interpreting Paragraph 97

                         35. In paragraph 93, the Court found that the activities carried out by
                      Nicaragua in the disputed territory after 2010, including the excavation of
                      three caños and establishing a military presence in part of that territory,
                      constituted a breach of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty. The Court
                      further considers reparation for this breach in paragraphs 139 and 142. In
                      paragraph 97, the Court turns to Costa Rica’s claim that Nicaragua
                      breached the prohibition of the use of force. On this claim, the Court’s
                      position is that since it had already determined the unlawful character of
                      Nicaragua’s activities, there was no need to consider any further
                      Costa Rica’s submission that those activities breached the prohibition of

                      earlier, the Court followed its decision in Cameroon v. Nigeria where the
                      Court finds that, “by the very fact of the present Judgment and the evac-
                      uation” of the disputed territory, the injury suffered by Costa Rica “will
                      in all events have been sufficiently addressed” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      2002, p. 452, para. 319).
                         36. The Court did not therefore make any discrete, express determina-
                      tion as to whether the prohibition of the use of force under Article 2 (4) of
                      the United Nations Charter had been breached. But it is not at all clear that
                      the Court has dispensed with any further consideration of Costa Rica’s
                      submissions relating to the use of force. A question arises as to the meaning
                      of the phrase “the injury suffered by Costa Rica”. The initial impression
                      might be that the finding is confined to the injury suffered by Costa Rica as
                      a result of the breach of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The most
                      relevant feature of the “Judgment as a whole” is the Court’s finding that
                      Costa Rica has sovereignty over the disputed territory, that its territorial
                      sovereignty has been breached and the reparation awarded as a result. Yet,

                      use of force because any injury suffered as a result of those allegations
                      would, in its view, be remedied. The sweeping phrase “in all events” sug-
                      gests a wider coverage and there would not seem to be any need for this
                      broader, all‑embracing phrase if “injury” were confined to a breach of sov-
                      ereignty and territorial integrity. I therefore interpret the phrase “the injury
                      suffered by Costa Rica” as encompassing any injury suffered by Costa Rica
                      as a result of a breach of the prohibition of the use of force.
                         37. If that is the correct interpretation, the question that arises is, how
                      does the Court determine the appropriate reparation for a breach of the
                      prohibition of the use of force without having first examined the claim
                      and decided that there was such a breach ? The obligation to make repa-
                      ration flows from a breach of an international obligation and the appro-
                      priate form and parameters of reparation are thus influenced by the fact
