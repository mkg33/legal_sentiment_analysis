                       25. Article 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, and Article 38,
                     paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court require an applicant to indicate the
                     “subject of the dispute” in the application. The application shall also
                     specify the “precise nature of the claim” (Art. 38, para. 2, of the Rules of
                     Court ; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court,
                     Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 448, para. 29).

                        26. It is for the Court itself, however, to determine on an objective
                     basis the subject‑matter of the dispute between the parties, that is, to “iso-
                     late the real issue in the case and to identify the object of the claim”
                     (Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974,
                     p. 262, para. 29 ; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment,
                     I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 466, para. 30). In doing so, the Court examines the
                     positions of both parties, “while giving particular attention to the formu-
                     lation of the dispute chosen by the [a]pplicant” (Fisheries Jurisdiction
                     (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                     1998, p. 448, para. 30 ; see also Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicara‑

                     2007 (II), p. 848, para. 38). The Court recalls that the Rules of Court
                     require that the application specify the “facts and grounds on which the
                     claim is based” and that a memorial include a statement of the “relevant
                     facts” (Art. 38, para. 2, and Art. 49, para. 1, respectively). To identify the
                     subject‑matter of the dispute, the Court bases itself on the application, as
                     well as the written and oral pleadings of the parties. In particular, it takes
                     account of the facts that the applicant identifies as the basis for its claim

                        27. Bolivia’s Application states that the dispute between Bolivia and
                     Chile relates to “Chile’s obligation to negotiate in good faith and effec-
                     tively with Bolivia in order to reach an agreement granting Bolivia a fully
                     sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean”. It further indicates that “[t]he sub-
                     ject of the dispute lies in: (a) the existence of that obligation, (b) the
                     non‑compliance with that obligation by Chile, and (c) Chile’s duty to
                     comply with the said obligation”. Bolivia’s Memorial is to the same effect
                     (see paragraph 18 above).
                        28. Chile contends that the subject‑matter of Bolivia’s claim is territo-
                     rial sovereignty and the character of Bolivia’s access to the Pacific Ocean.
                     It does not dispute that the Application portrays Bolivia’s claim as one
                     concerning an obligation to negotiate. However, according to Chile, this
                     alleged obligation is in fact an obligation to conduct negotiations the out-
                     come of which is predetermined, namely, the grant to Bolivia of sovereign
                     access to the Pacific Ocean. Only the details of that sovereign access —
                     such as how much territory is involved and its location — would be sub-
                     ject to negotiation. Thus, in Chile’s view, Bolivia is not seeking an open
                     negotiation comprised of good faith exchanges, but rather negotiations
                     with a judicially predetermined outcome. Chile states that the alleged
                     obligation to negotiate should be seen as an “artificial means” to imple-
                     ment Bolivia’s alleged right to sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.

                        29. Chile also maintains that Bolivia could be granted sovereign access
                     to the sea only through revision or nullification of the 1904 Peace Treaty.
                     Any negotiation resulting in sovereign access to the sea would modify the
                     allocation of sovereignty over territory and the character of Bolivia’s
                     access to the sea, upon which the Parties agreed in that Treaty. Accord-
                     ingly, Chile claims that Bolivia’s Application seeks “revision of the settle-
                     ment reached in 1904 concerning territorial sovereignty and the character
                     of Bolivia’s access to the sea”.

                       30. Bolivia responds that Chile misrepresents the dispute that is the
                     subject of the Application. It emphasizes that the Application asks the
                     Court to find that Chile has an obligation to negotiate sovereign access to
                     the sea. Bolivia maintains that the result of those negotiations and the
                     specific modalities of sovereign access are not matters for the Court but,
                     rather, are matters for future agreement to be negotiated by the Parties in
                     good faith. It also states that there is no dispute regarding the validity of
                     the 1904 Peace Treaty and that it does not seek the revision or nullifica-





5 CIJ1084.indb 158                                                                                   18/05/16 14:13

                     tion of that Treaty in these proceedings. Instead, according to Bolivia, the
                     alleged obligation to negotiate exists independently of, and in parallel to,
                     the 1904 Peace Treaty.

                                                         **
                        31. The Court observes that, consistent with Article 38, paragraph 2,
                     of the Rules of Court, the Application specifies the facts and grounds on
                     which the claim is based. In support of the claim that there is an obliga-
                     tion to negotiate sovereign access to the sea, the Application cites “agree-
                     ments, diplomatic practice and a series of declarations attributable to
                     [Chile’s] highest‑level representatives”. It also states that Chile — con-
                     trary to the position that Chile had itself adopted — later rejected and
                     denied the existence of the alleged obligation to negotiate in 2011 and
                     2012, and that Chile has breached this obligation. The Application does
                     not invoke the 1904 Peace Treaty as a source of rights or obligations for
                     either Party, nor does it ask the Court to make any pronouncement
                     regarding the legal status of that Treaty. On its face, therefore, the Appli-
                     cation presents a dispute about the existence of an obligation to negotiate
                     sovereign access to the sea, and the alleged breach thereof.

                         32. Chile would have the Court set aside the dispute as presented in the
                       Application because, in its view, the Application obfuscates the true
                     ­subject‑matter of Bolivia’s claim — territorial sovereignty and the charac-
                     ter of Bolivia’s access to the Pacific Ocean. As the Court has observed in
                     the past, applications that are submitted to the Court often present a par-
                     ticular dispute that arises in the context of a broader disagreement
                     between parties (Application of the International Convention on the
                      ­Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian
                       Federation), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (I),
                       pp. 85‑86, para. 32 ; see also Border and Transborder Armed Actions
                       (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J.
                       Reports 1988, pp. 91‑92, para. 54 ; United States Diplomatic and Consular
                       Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran), Judgment,
                       I.C.J. Reports 1980, pp. 19‑20, paras. 36‑37). The Court considers that,
                       while it may be assumed that sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean is, in
                       the end, Bolivia’s goal, a distinction must be drawn between that goal and
                       the related but distinct dispute presented by the Application, namely,
                       whether Chile has an obligation to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to
                       the sea and, if such an obligation exists, whether Chile has breached it.
                       The Application does not ask the Court to adjudge and declare that
                       Bolivia has a right to sovereign access.

                        33. As to Chile’s assertion that the Application presents an artificial
                     framing of the subject‑matter in dispute, because the relief sought by
                     Bolivia would lead to negotiations with a judicially predetermined out-
                     come and to modification of the 1904 Peace Treaty, the Court recalls that

                     605 	        obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                      Bolivia does not ask the Court to declare that it has a right to sovereign
                      access to the sea nor to pronounce on the legal status of the 1904 Peace
                     Treaty. Moreover, should this case proceed to the merits, Bolivia’s claim
                     would place before the Court the Parties’ respective contentions about
                     the existence, nature and content of the alleged obligation to negotiate
                     sovereign access. Even assuming arguendo that the Court were to find the
                     existence of such an obligation, it would not be for the Court to predeter-
                     mine the outcome of any negotiation that would take place in conse-
                     quence of that obligation.
                         34. In view of the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes that the
                     ­subject‑matter of the dispute is whether Chile is obligated to negotiate
                      in good faith Bolivia’s sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, and, if such
                      an obligation exists, whether Chile has breached it.

                                                          *
                       35. The Court recalls that the submissions in Bolivia’s Application and
                     Memorial refer to an “obligation to negotiate . . . in order to reach an
                     agreement granting Bolivia a fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean”.
                     Bolivia has repeatedly stated that Chile has an “obligation to negotiate
                     sovereign access to the sea”. Chile has also used in its written and oral
                     pleadings the phrase “sovereign access to the sea”.

                        When a Member of the Court asked each Party to define what it meant
                     by the phrase “sovereign access to the sea”, Bolivia responded that the
                     “existence and specific content” of the alleged obligation to negotiate sov-
                     ereign access to the sea was not a matter to be determined at the prelimi-
                     nary stage of the proceedings but, rather was to be determined at the
                     merits stage of the proceedings. Chile, for its part, answered that Bolivia
                     used the expression “sovereign access to the sea” in its Application and
                     Memorial to refer to the transfer or cession to Bolivia of Chilean terri-
                     tory, and that this phrase had the same meaning in Chile’s preliminary
                     objection.
                        36. Bearing in mind these observations by the Parties, the Court
                     emphasizes that the use in this Judgment of the phrases “sovereign access”
                     and “to negotiate sovereign access” should not be understood as express-
                     ing any view by the Court about the existence, nature or content of any
                     alleged obligation to negotiate on the part of Chile.


                     IV. Whether the Matters in Dispute before the Court Fall under
                                    Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá

                        37. The Court will now consider the jurisdictional régime of the Pact
                     of Bogotá. The Court recalls that the Pact contains a number of provi-
                     sions relating to the judicial settlement of disputes. Article XXXI of the
                     Pact provides that the Parties recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the





5 CIJ1084.indb 162                                                                                  18/05/16 14:13

                     606 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                     Court in all disputes of a juridical nature arising among them concerning
                     matters listed therein (see paragraph 20 above).

                       38. The other relevant provisions of the Pact of Bogotá are Articles VI
                     and XXXIII. As already noted, Article VI states that:

                            “The . . . procedures [laid down in the Pact of Bogotá] . . . may not
                          be applied to matters already settled by arrangement between the
                          parties, or by arbitral award or by decision of an international court,
                          or which are governed by agreements or treaties in force on the date
                          of the conclusion of the present Treaty.”
                     Article XXXIII of the Pact of Bogotá provides that: “If the parties fail to
                     agree as to whether the Court has jurisdiction over the controversy, the
                     Court itself shall first decide that question.”
                        39. Under Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá, if the Court were to find
                     that, given the subject‑matter of the dispute as identified by the Court in
                     paragraph 34 above, the matters in dispute between the Parties were mat-
                     ters “already settled by arrangement between the parties” or “governed by
                     agreements or treaties in force” on 30 April 1948, it would lack the requi-
                     site jurisdiction under the Pact of Bogotá to decide the case on the merits.
                     Consequently, the Court will proceed to determine whether the matters in
                     dispute are matters “settled” or “governed” by the 1904 Peace Treaty.
                        40. The Court recalls the following provisions of the 1904 Peace Treaty,
                     in force on 30 April 1948. Article I re‑established the relations of peace
                     and friendship between Bolivia and Chile and terminated the régime
                     established by the 1884 Truce Pact of Valparaíso.
                        Article II of the 1904 Peace Treaty provides: “[b]y the present Treaty,
                     the territories occupied by Chile by virtue of Article 2 of the Truce Pact
                     of 4 April 1884, are recognized as belonging absolutely and in perpetuity
                     to Chile.”
                        Article II continues by delimiting the boundary between Bolivia and
                     Chile and setting out the procedure for demarcation.
                        In Article III, the Parties agreed on the construction of a railway
                     between the port of Arica and the Plateau of La Paz, at the expense of
                     Chile.
                        Article VI provides:
                             “The Republic of Chile recognizes in favour of Bolivia in perpetu-
                          ity the fullest and most unrestricted right of commercial transit in its
                          territory and its Pacific ports.
                             Both Governments will agree, in special acts, upon the method
                          suitable for securing, without prejudice to their respective fiscal inter-
                          ests, the object indicated above.”
                       Article VII provides:

                       Articles VIII, IX, X and XI regulate aspects of commercial interchange
                     between the Parties, customs and the transit of goods. Chile also made
                     other financial commitments in favour of Bolivia (Arts. IV and V).

                        41. In Chile’s view, Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá undoubtedly
                     excludes the present dispute between the Parties from the Court’s jurisdic-
                     tion. Chile submits that the purpose of Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá
                     was to preclude the possibility of using the dispute settlement procedures
                     of the Pact and, in particular, judicial remedies, “in order to reopen such
                     matters as were settled between the parties to the Pact, because they had
                     been the object of an international judicial decision or a treaty” (citing
                     Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary
                     Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 858, para. 77).
                        42. Chile submits that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
                     two limbs of Article VI and argues that a matter is “settled” by arrange-
                     ment if it is resolved by that arrangement, while a matter is “governed” by
                     a treaty if the treaty regulates the relationship between the parties concern-
                     ing that subject‑matter. In the present case, Chile concludes that territorial
                     sovereignty and the character of Bolivia’s access to the Pacific Ocean are
                     matters both “settled” and “governed” by the 1904 Peace Treaty.
                        43. In this respect, Chile argues, first, that Article II of the 1904 Peace
                     Treaty is a comprehensive territorial settlement between the two States
                     and that the question of territorial sovereignty is therefore a matter set-
                     tled and governed by that provision. Chile also maintains that Article II
                     of the 1904 Peace Treaty has the following material components:
                             “First, it addresses Chilean sovereignty over what had, until the
                          Pacific War of 1879, been the Bolivian Littoral Department. Second,
                          it delimited the boundary between Chile and Bolivia from south to
                          north in the area of the Chilean provinces of Antofagasta and Tara-
                          pacá. Third, it agreed and delimited the frontier line between Chile
                          and Bolivia in the area of Tacna and Arica. Fourth, it provided for
                          the demarcation of the entire boundary.”

                       44. Secondly, Chile contends that the character of Bolivia’s access to
                     the sea is a matter settled and governed by Articles VI and VII of the





5 CIJ1084.indb 166                                                                                    18/05/16 14:13

                     608 	         obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                     1904 Peace Treaty, which relate to Bolivia’s perpetual right of commer-
                     cial transit and its right to establish customs agencies in Chilean ports,
                     respectively.
                        45. Thirdly, Chile submits that Articles III to XI — with Articles VI
                     and VII featuring predominantly — established treaty‑based arrange-
                     ments and commitments governing core aspects of the Parties’ relations
                     going forward.
                        46. Chile thus concludes that the terms of the 1904 Peace Treaty leave
                     no room for doubt that “territorial sovereignty” and “the character of
                     Bolivia’s access to the Pacific Ocean” are matters settled and governed by
                     that Treaty.

                       47. For its part, Bolivia argues that the basis of its claim is that

                          “independently of the 1904 Treaty Chile agreed to negotiate to grant
                          Bolivia a sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. It is because this issue
                          was not ‘settled’ by the 1904 Treaty that both Parties agreed after-
                          wards on negotiations to grant Bolivia such a sovereign access to the
                          Ocean.” (Emphasis in the original.)
                     It maintains that the Parties were negotiating this pending issue until
                     2011 when Chile allegedly reneged on its obligation to negotiate. It fur-
                     ther argues that Chile should comply with its obligation to negotiate
                     Bolivia’s sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and that the 1904 Peace
                     Treaty cannot provide a reasonable basis for Chile’s invocation of Arti-
                     cle VI of the Pact of Bogotá as a bar to the Court’s jurisdiction.

                        48. While Bolivia agrees that Chile has provided an accurate depiction
                     of the purpose of Article VI (see paragraph 41 above), it finds Chile’s
                     interpretation of Article VI overly expansive. Moreover, it argues that
                     Chile fails to draw any practical conclusion from the distinction between
                     the two limbs of that Article. In this respect, it refers to the case of the
                     Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), where the
                     Court concluded that,
                          “in the specific circumstances of the present case, there is no difference
                          in legal effect, for the purpose of applying Article VI of the Pact,
                          between a given matter being ‘settled’ by the 1928 Treaty and
                          being ‘governed’ by that Treaty. In light of the foregoing, the Court
                          will hereafter use the word ‘settled’.” (Territorial and Maritime Dis‑
                          pute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment,
                          I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II), p. 848, para. 39.)
                     Bolivia maintains that in the present case too, there is no substantive dif-
                     ference between the application of the terms “settled” and “governed” for
                     the purposes of Article VI of the Pact.

                     609 	        obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                        49. Bolivia submits that, even if Chile’s interpretation of the two limbs
                     of Article VI were to be upheld, Chile’s objection would still fail because
                     the 1904 Peace Treaty could not have settled a dispute that did not exist
                     in 1904 and because it cannot govern matters such as those put forward
                     by Bolivia, which did not fall within the terms of that Treaty. Bolivia
                     maintains that, by mischaracterizing its claim as one regarding “territo-
                     rial sovereignty and the character of Bolivia’s access to the sea” rather
                     than the one described in its Application and Memorial, namely, “the
                     existence and violation of the obligation to negotiate a sovereign access to
                     the Pacific Ocean agreed upon by Chile”, Chile erroneously draws the
                     conclusion that the matters in dispute are matters “settled and governed
                     by the 1904 Peace Treaty” and that Bolivia is merely seeking to “revise or
                     nullify” that Treaty.


                                                           **
                        50. As the Court concluded above, the subject‑matter of the dispute is
                     whether Chile is obligated to negotiate in good faith Bolivia’s sovereign
                     access to the Pacific Ocean, and, if such an obligation exists, whether
                     Chile has breached it (see paragraph 34 above). The provisions of the
                     1904 Peace Treaty set forth at paragraph 40 do not expressly or impliedly
                     address the question of Chile’s alleged obligation to negotiate Bolivia’s
                     sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. In the Court’s view, therefore, the
                     matters in dispute are matters neither “settled by arrangement between
                     the parties, or by arbitral award or by decision of an international court”
                     nor “governed by agreements or treaties in force on the date of the con-
                     clusion of the [Pact of Bogotá]” within the meaning of Article VI of the
                     Pact of Bogotá. This conclusion holds regardless of whether, as Chile
                     maintains, the two limbs of Article VI have a different scope (see para-
                     graph 42 above). The Court does not, therefore, find it necessary in the
                     circumstances of the present case to determine whether or not there is a
                     distinction between the legal effect of those two limbs.

                        51. The Court recalls that the Parties have presented their respective
                     views on “agreements, diplomatic practice and . . . declarations” invoked
                     by Bolivia to substantiate its claim on the merits (see paragraphs 19 and
                     22 above). The Court is of the view that, for the purposes of determining
                     the question of its jurisdiction, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to
                     examine those elements.

                       52. As noted above, Chile’s submission is that the Court should declare
                     that it lacks jurisdiction (see paragraph 14 above). Bolivia’s submission is
                     that the Court should reject Chile’s objection to jurisdiction (ibid.). In





5 CIJ1084.indb 170                                                                                  18/05/16 14:13

                     610 	        obligation to negotiate access (judgment)

                     the alternative, Bolivia argues that if the Court addressed Chile’s objec-
                     tion on the basis of Chile’s characterization of the subject‑matter of the
                     dispute, the objection would amount to a refutation of Bolivia’s case on
                     the merits, and thus would not possess an exclusively preliminary charac-
                     ter. As indicated above, the Court does not accept Chile’s characteriza-
                     tion of the subject‑matter of the dispute (see paragraph 34). Bolivia’s
                     alternative argument is therefore moot.

                        53. The Court recalls however that it is for it to decide, under Arti-
                     cle 79, paragraph 9, of the Rules of Court, whether in the circumstances
                     of the case, an objection lacks an exclusively preliminary character. If so,
                     the Court must refrain from upholding or rejecting the objection at the
                     preliminary stage, and reserve its decision on this issue for further pro-
                     ceedings. In the present case, the Court considers that it has all the facts
                     necessary to rule on Chile’s objection and that the question whether the
                     matters in dispute are matters “settled” or “governed” by the 1904 Peace
                     Treaty can be answered without determining the dispute, or elements
                     thereof, on the merits (Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v.
                     Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (II),
                     p. 852, para. 51). Consequently, the Court finds that it is not precluded
                     from ruling on Chile’s objection at this stage.



                                     V. The Court’s Conclusion regarding
                                          the Preliminary Objection

                        54. Bearing in mind the subject‑matter of the dispute, as earlier identi-
                     fied (see paragraph 34 above), the Court concludes that the matters in
                     dispute are not matters “already settled by arrangement between the par-
                     ties, or by arbitral award or by decision of an international court” or
                     “governed by agreements or treaties in force on the date of the conclusion
                     of the [Pact of Bogotá]”. Consequently, Article VI does not bar the
                     Court’s jurisdiction under Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogotá. Chile’s
                     preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the Court must be dismissed.
                        55. In accordance with Article 79, paragraph 9, of the Rules of Court,
                     the time‑limits for the further proceedings shall be fixed by order of the
                     Court.
