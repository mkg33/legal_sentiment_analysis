                         1. As my votes indicate, I am in broad agreement with the Court’s
                      decision in this case. I write separately to explain my vote against the
                      Court’s rejection in paragraph 229 (7) of all other submissions made by
                      the Parties.
                         2. In its final submissions, 2 (b) (ii), Costa Rica asked the Court to
                      find a breach by Nicaragua of “the prohibition of the threat or use of
                      force under Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and Article 22 of
                      the Charter of the Organization of American States” 1. In its earlier sub-
                      missions, Costa Rica also asked the Court to find Nicaragua responsible
                      for its violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force pursuant
                      to Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, and Articles 1, 19, 21, 22
                      and 29 of the Charter of the Organization of American States 2.



                        3. I am of the opinion that the facts establish Nicaragua’s breach of
                      Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and that in the circumstances
                      of this case the Court should have separately and explicitly determined
                      the claim that there was a breach of that provision. The opinion also
                      argues that the Court should adopt a practice of determining the merits
                      of a claim that Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter has been
                      breached, unless the claim is patently unmeritorious or frivolous. In this

                      opinion, I also explain my hesitations regarding what appears to be the
                      Court’s finding that, in this case, reparation awarded for a breach of ter-
                      ritorial sovereignty would sufficiently address the injury suffered as a
                      result of any potential breach of Article 2 (4).

                        4. This opinion is divided as follows :
                      A. The Court’s approach
                      B. The background
                      C. The need for the Court to determine the merits of a claim that there is
                         a breach of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter

                                              A. The Court’s Approach

                        5. In ruling on Costa Rica’s submissions about the prohibition of the
                      threat or use of force, the Court states the following in paragraph 97 :

                               “The fact that Nicaragua considered that its activities were taking
                            place on its own territory does not exclude the possibility of charac-
                            terizing them as unlawful use of force. This raises the issue of their
                            compatibility with both the United Nations Charter and the Charter
                            of the Organization of American States. However, in the circum-
                            stances, given that the unlawful character of these activities has
                            already been established, the Court need not dwell any further on this
                            submission. As in the case concerning Land and the Maritime Bound‑
                            ary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria : Equatorial
                            Guinea intervening), the Court finds that, ‘by the very fact of the
                            present Judgment and the evacuation’ of the disputed territory, the
                            injury suffered by Costa Rica ‘will in all events have been sufficiently
                            addressed’ (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 452, para. 319).”

                         6. In doing so, the Court follows its approach in Land and Maritime
                      Boundary (Cameroon v. Nigeria). In that case, Cameroon had asked the
                      Court to adjudge and declare that by “invading and occupying its terri-
                      tory”, Nigeria had violated its conventional and customary obligations ;
                      in particular, the prohibition of the use of force, the principle of non‑inter-

                      vention and Cameroon’s territorial sovereignty 3. Cameroon argued that
                      Nigeria was under an obligation to end its presence in Cameroonian ter-
                      ritory, evacuate any occupied areas, refrain from such acts in future, and
                      to make reparation for material and non‑material injury 4. Given the
                      unsettled nature of the boundary, Nigeria argued that it believed its
                      actions were lawful 5.

                         7. The evidence shows that the acts pleaded by Cameroon included at
                      least 80 incidents 6, some of them resulting in loss of life 7 due to active
                      engagements between Cameroonian and Nigerian military forces on
                      Cameroonian territory and arrests by military forces. The alleged acts
                      had taken place over a 15‑year period and the large majority occurred on
                      parts of the territory that were in dispute 8.
                         8. The Court found that, in light of its decision on the boundary
                      between the two States, Nigeria was under an obligation to withdraw its
                      civilian and military presence from occupied areas that the Court had
                      found to belong to Cameroon 9. The Court did not explicitly adjudicate
                      Cameroon’s claims of breach of the prohibition of the use of force 10,
                      holding that :
                              “In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers moreover
                            that, by the very fact of the present Judgment and of the evacuation
                            of the Cameroonian territory occupied by Nigeria, the injury suffered

                         7 While there appears to have been disagreement between the Parties about the number

                      of persons killed, it is clear that lives were lost. For example, Cameroon and Nigeria
                      appear to agree on the fact that during the military exchange between the two countries

                                                   B. The Background

                         10. The Judgment does not set out in detail the facts which substanti-
                      ate Costa Rica’s claim of a breach of Article 2 (4) of the
                      United Nations Charter. The treatment of this issue is very sparse, being
                      confined to: (i) paragraphs 66 and 67, which mention Nicaragua’s place-
                      ment of military units in the area of Isla Portillos with the indication that
                      the matter would be considered in relation to Nicaragua’s compliance
                      with the Court’s Order on provisional measures, of 8 March 2011;
                      (ii) paragraph 93, where the Court finds that Nicaragua’s activities were a
                      breach of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty; (iii) paragraph 97, in which
                      the Court finds that the injury suffered by Costa Rica will in all events
                      have been sufficiently addressed; (iv) paragraphs 121 to 129, which
                      address the question of Nicaragua’s compliance with provisional mea-
                      sures ; and (v) paragraph 139 and 142, in which the Court deals with rep-
                      aration for certain activities by Nicaragua, are also relevant to the
                      discussion.


                         11. These paragraphs have to be read along with relevant passages
                      from the pleadings of the Parties. The Court has held, in paragraph 67 of
                      the Judgment, that violations that occurred in 2013, although taking
                      place after Costa Rica’s Application was filed, may be examined “as part
                      of the merits of the claim” since “they concern facts which are of the same
                      nature as those covered in the Application and which the Parties had the
                      opportunity to discuss in their pleadings”. As such, they are considered in
                      this opinion.

                               C. The Need for the Court to Determine the Merits
                                of a Claim that there Is a Breach of Article 2 (4)
                                         of the United Nations Charter

                        27. The prohibition of the threat or use of force is a foundational rule
                      of the international legal system. It has been described by the Court as “a
                      cornerstone of the United Nations Charter” 32. The prohibition has been
                      deemed to “represent . . . beside the protection of human rights, ‘the
                      major achievement of the international legal order in the 20th century . . .

                                           D. Interpreting Paragraph 97

                         35. In paragraph 93, the Court found that the activities carried out by
                      Nicaragua in the disputed territory after 2010, including the excavation of
                      three caños and establishing a military presence in part of that territory,
                      constituted a breach of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty. The Court
                      further considers reparation for this breach in paragraphs 139 and 142. In
                      paragraph 97, the Court turns to Costa Rica’s claim that Nicaragua
                      breached the prohibition of the use of force. On this claim, the Court’s
                      position is that since it had already determined the unlawful character of
                      Nicaragua’s activities, there was no need to consider any further
                      Costa Rica’s submission that those activities breached the prohibition of
                      the use of force in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter. As noted
                      earlier, the Court followed its decision in Cameroon v. Nigeria where the
                      Court finds that, “by the very fact of the present Judgment and the evac-
                      uation” of the disputed territory, the injury suffered by Costa Rica “will
                      in all events have been sufficiently addressed” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports
                      2002, p. 452, para. 319).
                         36. The Court did not therefore make any discrete, express determina-
                      tion as to whether the prohibition of the use of force under Article 2 (4) of
                      the United Nations Charter had been breached. But it is not at all clear that
                      the Court has dispensed with any further consideration of Costa Rica’s
                      submissions relating to the use of force. A question arises as to the meaning
                      of the phrase “the injury suffered by Costa Rica”. The initial impression
                      might be that the finding is confined to the injury suffered by Costa Rica as
                      a result of the breach of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The most
                      relevant feature of the “Judgment as a whole” is the Court’s finding that
                      Costa Rica has sovereignty over the disputed territory, that its territorial
                      sovereignty has been breached and the reparation awarded as a result. Yet,
                      the Court has deemed it unnecessary to rule on submissions relating to the
                      use of force because any injury suffered as a result of those allegations
                      would, in its view, be remedied. The sweeping phrase “in all events” sug-
                      gests a wider coverage and there would not seem to be any need for this
                      broader, all‑embracing phrase if “injury” were confined to a breach of sov-
                      ereignty and territorial integrity. I therefore interpret the phrase “the injury
                      suffered by Costa Rica” as encompassing any injury suffered by Costa Rica
                      as a result of a breach of the prohibition of the use of force.
                         37. If that is the correct interpretation, the question that arises is, how
                      does the Court determine the appropriate reparation for a breach of the
                      prohibition of the use of force without having first examined the claim
                      and decided that there was such a breach ? The obligation to make repa-
                      ration flows from a breach of an international obligation and the appro-
                      priate form and parameters of reparation are thus influenced by the fact

                      view, the finding that comes closest to reparation for that breach is the
                      finding of a breach of Costa Rica’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
                      The paragraph also seems to proceed on the basis that, even if there is no
                      equivalence between the two norms, their relative values are such that a
                      breach of the prohibition of the use of force may be sufficiently remedied
                      by what flows from a finding of a breach of sovereignty and territorial
                      integrity. The Court’s conclusion in paragraph 97 suggests that it has
                      engaged in a comparative exercise. However, it is a conclusion that is
                      arrived at without any examination by the Court of the evidence relating

                      as the immediate corollary of a State’s responsibility i.e., as an obligation of the responsible
                      State resulting from the breach, rather than as a right of an injured State or States . . .” And
                      as was famously stated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Factory at
                      Chorzów case (Factory at Chorzów, Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 8, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A,
                      No. 9, p. 21): “It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement
                      involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore, is
                      the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention . . .”

                              eignty.
                                 This declaration is in accordance with the request made by Albania through her
                              Counsel, and is in itself appropriate satisfaction.” (Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

                      integrity serve distinct functions, they reflect overlapping, but not identi-
                      cal, concerns 45. It is the element of the use of force that fundamentally
                      distinguishes the interests protected by Article 2 (4) of the United Nations
                      Charter from conduct that breaches sovereignty and territorial integrity
                      simpliciter. What the Court has done in its finding in the last sentence of
                      paragraph 97 requires some kind of weighing exercise leading to a conclu-
                      sion as to the relative values of the prohibition of the use of force against
                      territorial integrity and the relative values of the legal protection of sov-
                      ereignty and territorial integrity. But the Judgment offers no explanation
                      as to how this weighing exercise is carried out. In my view, a finding that
                      a country’s territorial sovereignty is breached should not, in the context
                      of this case, be used to provide reparation for a breach of Article 2 (4) of
                      the United Nations Charter.

                         40. The consequences of a breach of the norm prohibiting the use of
                      force will usually, or is much more likely to be far more calamitous than
                      a breach of the norm protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity sim‑
                      pliciter ; the first breach contains a greater risk of escalation posing a
                      threat to international peace and security. The overriding concern about
                      the use of force is that a powerful State may use it for its own advantage
                      and selfish purposes to the detriment of the international community.
                      This concern is well reflected in Corfu Channel where the Court spoke of
                      “the manifestation of a policy of force, such as has, in the past, given rise
                      to most serious abuses” 46. Of course, breaches of territorial integrity can
                      lead, and have in the past led to international conflicts. But the Court was
                      right to emphasize the very likely connection between a policy of force
                      and consequential calamitous abuses. In that case, the Court did not
                      accept the United Kingdom’s claim that it could, with the help of its mil-
                      itary, enter Albanian territorial waters to secure possible evidence of
                      Albania’s internationally wrongful conduct. Such a “right of interven-
                      tion”, the Court said, “would be reserved for the most powerful States,
                      and might easily lead to perverting the administration of international
                      justice itself ” 47. Similarly, and in general terms, the act of a country that


                         65. Nothing in this opinion is to be seen as taking a position that
                      devalues the legal prohibition of the use of force or as taking the prover-
                      bial sledgehammer to kill a flea. International law has a spectrum of
                      activities that may breach Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter at
                      its higher, middle and lower reaches ; some of the activities at the higher
                      reaches may amount to aggression, “the most serious and dangerous
                      form of illegal use of force” 73; others may constitute an armed attack giv-
                      ing rise to self‑defence. Activities at the middle and lower reaches may
                      also breach Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter if they are accom-
                      panied by the requisite gravity and purpose ; such activities may very well
                      be what the Court had in mind in Paramilitary Activities when it referred
                      to “other less grave forms of the use of force” 74. The presence of grad­
                      ations in the law relating to the use of force responds to the concern that
                      a finding that activities at the middle or lower end of the spectrum, if
                      accompanied by the requisite gravity and purpose, constitute a breach of
                      Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, would somehow discredit the
                      seriousness of the international obligations involved.


                         66. In order to determine the rules applicable to those “less grave
                      forms of the use of force” the Court, after emphasizing the customary
                      status of the Friendly Relations Declaration, went on to cite a number of
                      duties set out in the declaration. Included in the Court’s list, as already

                      stated 75, is “the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate
                      the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of
                      solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and concern-
                      ing frontiers of States”. It is precisely this duty that Nicaragua breached
                      when it placed its soldiers on Costa Rican territory.

                         67. In my view, a State placing members of its military force on the
                      territory of another State on two occasions for a combined period of
                      about one year over a three‑year period is a breach of the norm prohibit-
                      ing the use of force. These activities by Nicaragua certainly cannot be
                      characterized as a “mere frontier incident” of the kind referred to by the
                      Court in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
                      (Nicaragua v. United States of America) 76. The presence of a military
                      force for such a long period without the consent of the other State consti-
                      tutes, by itself, a breach of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter.
                      This action could certainly have led to a military conflict between Nicara-
                      gua and Costa Rica and posed a threat to international peace and secu-
                      rity, warranting the intervention of the Security Council, had Costa Rica
                      not exercised commendable restraint and chosen to have recourse to the
                      Court rather than to respond in kind. Nicaragua by its military presence
                      excluded Costa Rica from its own territory by staking a claim to territory
                      that had been determined from 1858 in the Treaty of Limits to be
                      Costa Rican, and which Nicaragua had never claimed as its own until
                      26 November 2010 after Costa Rica had filed its Application before the
                      Court on 18 November 2010. While not at the higher reaches of the spec-
                      trum, Nicaragua’s acts are certainly not at the lower end ; they are some-
                      where in between. Arguably, the prolonged presence of Nicaragua’s
                      forces on Costa Rican territory signifies that Nicaragua’s acts are not at
                      the lower end of the spectrum.


                         68. In my view, since the affront to Costa Rica is aggravated by the
                      prolonged Nicaraguan military presence on Costa Rican territory, par-
                      ticularly so in the nine‑month period after the Court ordered Nicaragua
                      to remove its soldiers, it would be appropriate to consider an apology as
                      satisfaction.
                         69. It is not clear from the evidence how many soldiers were actually
                      placed by Nicaragua in the disputed territory. What is certain, however,
                      is that the military presence was sufficiently substantial to have been
                      described by Costa Rica and acknowledged by Nicaragua as “a military
                      encampment” 77 and notably, in its Order for provisional measures of
                      22 November 2013, the Court found that the photograph dated 5 Febru-

                      ary 2013 did show a “Nicaraguan army encampment” 78. The fact that the
                      Nicaraguan force may not have been constituted by a very large number
                      of soldiers does not in any way detract from the characterization of Nica-
                      ragua’s conduct as an unlawful use of force in contravention of Arti-
                      cle 2 (4) of the Charter. Generally, the size of a military force deployed
                      will depend upon a variety of factors, including the purpose of the deploy-
                      ment, the characteristics of the particular location and a State’s military
                      capability, including the number of troops at its disposal.

                        70. It is recalled that while the means employed in using force is rele-
                      vant in determining gravity and therefore, lawfulness, it is not conclusive ;
                      the effect of the means must also be considered. In this case, the number
                      of soldiers deployed by Nicaragua was sufficient to achieve its unlawful
                      ends : it was able to remain on Costa Rican territory for a period of about
                      one year over a three‑year period in order to further its policy.

                         71. The years since the adoption of the United Nations Charter have
                      only served to re‑emphasize the importance to the international legal
                      order, of Article 2 (4) and its customary equivalent. The Court should
                      play its role in upholding and applying the prohibition, adjudicating
                      claims that the norm has been breached, unless the claim is patently
                      unmeritorious or frivolous.
