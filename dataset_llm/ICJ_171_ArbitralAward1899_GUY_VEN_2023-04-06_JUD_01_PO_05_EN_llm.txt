       4. Guyana first claimed, in substance, that Venezuela’s objection based on the well-known
jurisprudence in the case concerning Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 1 was, despite how
it had been characterized, an objection to jurisdiction that was inadmissible because the Court had
already found that it had jurisdiction in its Judgment of 18 December 2020. This contention is in fact
based on a conflation of the “(existence of) jurisdiction (between the parties)” and the “exercise of
this jurisdiction (in particular in respect of a third party)”, a distinction that is nonetheless firmly
rooted in the Court’s jurisprudence.

day, the Vice-President of Venezuela made clear from the outset that her Government considered
“that the Court manifestly lacks jurisdiction and that Venezuela ha[d] decided not to take part in the
proceedings” 2; at the same time, she handed the President of the Court a letter from the Venezuelan
Head of State in which the latter stated that “there is no basis for the jurisdiction of the Court” 3. As
in similar situations in the past, the Court decided, in its Order of 19 June 2018, using standard terms
whose meaning and scope had never before proved controversial, that since the Respondent had
immediately and firmly disputed the existence of any basis of jurisdiction enabling the Court to rule
on the dispute between the Parties, it “must resolve first of all the question of [its] jurisdiction, and
that this question should accordingly be separately determined before any proceedings on the
merits” 4. The time-limits fixed in that Order thus expressly and exclusively concerned the filing of
written pleadings on the jurisdiction of the Court. No grounds other than the lack of a basis of
jurisdiction inter partes enabling the Court to entertain the case were invoked by Venezuela to justify
its decision not to take part in the proceedings. Therefore, the written pleadings that were to be
produced pursuant to the Court’s Order dated 19 June 2018 could not address any other subject.

the parties themselves — the jurisdiction that had otherwise been conferred on it under the Statement
accompanying the Washington Agreement of 25 April 1951: “The Court accordingly finds that,
although Italy and the three respondent States have conferred jurisdiction upon the Court, it cannot
exercise this jurisdiction to adjudicate on the first claim submitted by Italy.” 8 There is thus no doubt
that the Court intended to make a very clear distinction between the “(existence of) jurisdiction
(between the parties)” and the “exercise [of] this jurisdiction”. By contrast, in the operative paragraph
of the Court’s Judgment in the case concerning East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), the question is
clearly characterized as relating to the “exercise of jurisdiction”: in that paragraph, the Court finds
“that it cannot in the present case exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the declarations made
by the Parties under Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute” 9. The situation is the same in the
reasoning of other decisions relating to this question in which the objection was not upheld, such as
those in the cases concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua

on the merits of those aspects resumed, and the Respondent was entitled to raise, within three months
of the filing of the Memorial on the merits, any preliminary objection on which “the Court ha[d] not
taken any decision under Article 79”, to quote the introductory sentence of the new Article 79bis of
the Rules.

       In this regard as well, I can only fully support the findings of the Judgment.


       17. Finally, it should be observed that if, by some remote chance, the Court had considered
that Venezuela’s objection was to be regarded as even partially constituting an objection to
jurisdiction20, it would in any event have had to rule on that objection — albeit not necessarily as a
preliminary matter 21 — since, according to well-established jurisprudence, the Court must always be
satisfied that it has jurisdiction 22.


            III. The treatment of Venezuela’s preliminary objection dated 7 June 2022

       18. First of all, a few words should be said about Guyana’s “legitimacy” as a Party to this case
and its standing to bring the case before the Court. In its preliminary objection, Venezuela appeared
to question this legitimacy on the ground that Guyana had not been a party to either the 1897
Washington Treaty or the arbitral proceedings that led to the Award of 3 October 1899. This claim
by Venezuela, which is closely linked to its argument that the United Kingdom is an indispensable
third party in this case, nonetheless appears to have been abandoned during the hearings.


       19. Guyana exercised its right to self-determination in respect of an area of territory that was
inherited as it stood from its British colonizer, in accordance with the principles of the intangibility
of colonial frontiers and uti possidetis juris. If the title underlying the extent of that area is challenged,
Guyana clearly has a direct interest and undisputed legitimacy in defending the integrity of what it
considers to be its territory. It is for this reason that it was involved in the negotiation and signature
of the Geneva Agreement even before it gained independence, and why it became a party thereto in
addition to the United Kingdom once that independence had been achieved, in accordance with
Article VIII of the said Agreement. This is also the reason why it has taken part, this time in lieu of
the United Kingdom, in the procedures that have since been implemented, by reference to the Geneva
Agreement, in an attempt to settle the dispute.

       This question as such calls for no further comments on my part.



                                                        *         *



     20. The crux of Venezuela’s objection concerned the application in this case of the Court’s
Monetary Gold jurisprudence, as subsequently articulated in other, previously mentioned decisions

       20 Even if the Court had intended for the jurisdictional questions (lato sensu) to include the question of the United

Kingdom’s “consen[t] to adjudication by the Court”, the issue of that State’s (non-)participation in the proceedings could
only remain outside the scope thereof.
        21 See e.g. Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports

2004 (I), p. 29, para. 24.
       22 See e.g. Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council (India v. Pakistan), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports

1972, p. 52, para. 13; Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia
and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007 (I), pp. 76 et seq. (“Initiative to the Court to
Reconsider ex officio Jurisdiction over Yugoslavia”).

(namely Military and Paramilitary Activities; El Salvador/Honduras, Application by Nicaragua for
permission to intervene; East Timor; and Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru) 23. The question in this
case was thus not only whether legal interests of the United Kingdom would be “affected” by any
decision of the Court on the merits of the dispute as the latter had defined it, but whether they would
also constitute the very subject-matter of that dispute, in the sense that the Court could not rule on
Guyana’s claims separately and independently without necessarily also ruling directly on the United
Kingdom’s legal interests or, indeed, assessing the lawfulness of that State’s conduct, as a logical
prerequisite to any findings on those claims. In other words, it was a matter of ascertaining whether
the United Kingdom was, to use the now standard expression, an “indispensable third party” in this
case, such that in its “absence” the Court could in no way exercise its jurisdiction (be it over the
United Kingdom or over the Parties) to decide the dispute.


       21. In its observations and submissions relating to the preliminary objection, Guyana argued
that the United Kingdom did not have or no longer had any legal interests that would enable the
Monetary Gold jurisprudence to be applied in this case. During the hearings, it advanced a new
argument for disregarding it: the United Kingdom had purportedly “consented” “to having the
dispute . . . settled by the Court”, merely by virtue of its status as a party to the Geneva Agreement
and in the light of the content of Articles II and IV thereof.



                                                *         *



       22. With regard, first, to the legal interests of the United Kingdom allegedly still at issue in
this case, Venezuela appears in its preliminary objection to focus primarily on that State’s status as
a party to the 1897 Washington Treaty (the “compromis”) and to the arbitral proceedings that were
instituted on the basis of that Treaty and that led to the Award of 3 October 1899. It is true that
Guyana was substituted for the United Kingdom in the territory that is partially in dispute and, in this
capacity, became a party to the dispute arising from Venezuela’s contention regarding the validity of
the territorial title constituted by the Award; however, this does not necessarily mean that Guyana
was retroactively substituted for the United Kingdom as a party to the compromis and the arbitral
proceedings. Even after the United Kingdom had transferred all its territorial rights to Guyana, it
retained its formal status of party to the Treaty (for as long as that treaty remained in force) and a
beneficiary of the Award. It is thus conceivable that, from a strictly formal perspective, a legal
interest of the United Kingdom could be affected by, or even central to, proceedings aimed at

        the jurisdiction of the Court.” 24


       23. However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the question arises as to
whether such an interest should be considered sufficiently “current” and “real” to justify the Court
declining to examine such an essential claim for Guyana as one aimed at preserving the integrity of
what it considers to be its territory. Moreover, in the period leading up to Guyana’s independence,
the United Kingdom actively promoted the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement as a general
procedural framework intended to facilitate the adoption of a “satisfactory” solution for the
“practical” settlement of the dispute, and left to Guyana alone, once the latter had achieved
independence, the status of party to the dispute, with that new State alone being represented within
the Mixed Commission and having to participate alone in the other proceedings envisaged under
Article IV of the Agreement. In these very specific circumstances, the United Kingdom could
reasonably be considered to have waived any right to rely on its formal status as a historical party to
the compromis and the arbitration proceedings for the purpose of objecting to the settlement, in its
absence, of the question of the validity of Guyana’s title to the disputed territory, at least in so far as
the grounds of nullity invoked in respect of the Award are alleged to be exclusively attributable to
the arbitrators (which would no doubt be the case as regards, for example, a lack of reasoning in the
Award, or an excess of authority stricto sensu, which might have led the arbitrators to exceed the
terms of the compromis and decide on the régime of navigation on the Amacuro and Barima rivers
and on the lighthouse dues and customs duties that could be levied in respect of the use of those
rivers). Furthermore, the “density” of the United Kingdom’s legal interest resulting solely from that
status as a historical party now appears so tenuous that the Court should be able to settle, in its
absence, the question thus delimited of the validity of the said territorial title, without violating the
Monetary Gold principle.

                 “So far as the condominium is concerned, the essential question in issue between the Parties is not
        the intrinsic validity of the 1917 Judgement of the Central American Court of Justice as between the parties
        to the proceedings in that Court, but the opposability to Honduras, which was not such a party, either of
        that Judgement itself or of the régime declared by the Judgement. Honduras, while rejecting the
        opposability to itself of the 1917 Judgement, does not ask the Chamber to declare it invalid.” (Emphasis
        added.)

preliminary objection 25, at the hearings Venezuela drew attention to grounds of nullity relating more
precisely and directly to the individual conduct of the United Kingdom.


       25. These quite serious allegations primarily concern the validity of the Washington Treaty,
and call that of the Award into question only indirectly: it is alleged that the Treaty’s validity was
affected by fraudulent tactics and coercion aimed, in particular, at imposing on Venezuela a
predetermined arbitral tribunal composition that accommodated the wishes of the United Kingdom,
and at precluding the application of the 1811 uti possidetis juris rule and the 1850 agreement to
maintain the status quo, in favour of acquisitive prescription, which was advantageous to the British
on account of their conduct on the ground over the preceding half-century.


       26. Other — equally serious — allegations directly relate to the validity of the Arbitral Award,
in light of the conditions in which it was allegedly drawn up: in this regard, Venezuela has referred
to collusion between the United Kingdom and the Powers with which it shared certain geostrategic
interests at the time, collusion between the United Kingdom and the arbitrators of its nationality,
undue pressure placed on the arbitrators by the British Government and the President of the tribunal,
the United Kingdom’s production of adulterated maps alleged to have strongly influenced the
decision reached, etc. If established, such acts would constitute not only fatal defects but also
unlawful acts, including by reference to the international law in force at the time of the alleged events.


       27. The International Law Commission recently confirmed that there is no “succession in
respect of State responsibility” in customary international law, and that the general rule in this regard
is “non-succession”. Paragraph 1 of the ILC’s draft guideline 9 on the “succession of States in respect
of State responsibility”, which is particularly relevant to the case at hand, states the following:

             “[A]n injured State continues to be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the
       predecessor State even after the date of succession:

to Guyana simply because it succeeded the United Kingdom in the disputed territory. Under these
circumstances, individual legal interests of the United Kingdom, separate from those of Guyana,
would in fact be at the centre of the dispute to be settled by the Court.


      28. Moreover, it is clear that, in the scenario envisaged, as in the Monetary Gold and East
Timor cases, the Court could not rule on the subject-matter of the claim, i.e. the validity of the Arbitral
Award, without first ruling on certain aspects of the United Kingdom’s conduct which are said, in
some instances, to be completely separate from the conduct of the arbitrators (as in the case of the
unlawful acts allegedly committed by the United Kingdom during the negotiation of the 1897 Treaty)
and, on the contrary, in other instances, to be inextricably linked to and inseparable from that conduct,

       25 See para. 51 of the said objection.

since they constituted the precondition for it (as in the case of the unlawful acts allegedly committed

       31. First of all, to claim that a third party to proceedings has consented to the Court ruling on
its conduct in those proceedings, with all the consequences this would entail, is inevitably tantamount
to contending that it has accepted the Court’s jurisdiction to do so: there is no escaping this
conclusion, which is immediate under the system developed by the drafters of the Court’s Statute
and which has, moreover, been acknowledged by Guyana 29. Yet, consistent jurisprudence shows that
the establishment of such consent is subject to very strict conditions, which scarcely appear to have
been met in this case.


       32. Moreover, under the same system, the Court can only exercise such jurisdiction over the
State concerned (and the parties) if that State is itself also a party to the proceedings in question: the




        27 Cf. Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

Ireland, and United States of America), Preliminary Question, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32: “In the determination
of these questions — questions which relate to the lawful or unlawful character of certain actions of Albania vis-à-vis Italy
— only two States, Italy and Albania, are directly interested. To go into the merits of such questions would be to decide a
dispute between Italy and Albania.”
       28 In its Judgment of 15 June 1954 in the Monetary Gold case, the Court indeed noted that “it [had] not [been]

contended by any Party that Albania ha[d] given her consent . . . either expressly or by implication”, to the settlement by
the Court of that State’s dispute with Italy, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32.
        29 See e.g. CR 2022/24, p. 14, para. 5, and pp. 20 et seq.

                                                           - 12 -

principles of reciprocity and the equality of States 30, and the adversarial principle 31, preclude any
other possibility, which would no doubt seriously jeopardize the integrity of both the rights of that
State and those of the parties.


       33. While it is in fact for States to consent to the jurisdiction of the Court or, what amounts to
the same thing, to jurisdiction otherwise established between other States being exercised in their
regard (in the sense of being extended to them), their consent to the exercise in general of that
jurisdiction (including in respect of those other States) is clearly insufficient for that jurisdiction to
be exercised, because the exercise of jurisdiction as such depends on non-derogable statutory norms
relating to the sound administration of justice, which are not subject to any kind of State control, and
on the conclusions that must be drawn therefrom by the Court in each particular case, with a view to

        31 The “equal opportunity . . . to discuss their respective contentions”, in the words of the Permanent Court, applies

only to the “parties” (Territorial Jurisdiction of the International Commission of the River Oder, Order of 15 August 1929,
P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 23, p. 45).
       32 In its Judgment, the Court moreover refers in this regard only to vague criticism that Venezuela levelled against

the Award in such political forums as the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly. The documents cited do not mention
any specific complaints calling into question the conduct of the United Kingdom.

                                                           - 13 -

discussed at length, of being involved in the subsequent stages of that settlement, let alone, I would
add, of having to answer for its own prior conduct in that context. In my view, to argue that, when it
signed the Agreement, the United Kingdom unequivocally intended to submit ipso facto to what at
the time could only have been — both legally and temporally speaking — the extremely distant
prospect of a ruling by the Court, on any past act howsoever related to the dispute in question, is to
misconstrue the text and context of that Agreement, and is contrary to the intention expressed therein.


       38. Moreover, one must not lose sight of another element, which, in the circumstances of the
case, I consider to be critical. From the moment that the Court is chosen as the means of settlement
by reference to the 1966 Agreement, the principles enshrined in its Statute apply in all respects: not
only do they fully govern the implementation of this means of settlement, but the undertakings made
in the Agreement must be consistent with these principles and must be interpreted in the light thereof.
It would be futile to seek to have the object and purpose of the Agreement, taken in isolation, prevail
over the Statute of the Court, which forms an integral part of the United Nations Charter. The inherent
constraints in choosing the Court as the means of settlement, which also serve as guarantees for those
who have recourse to it, were well known both when the Agreement was concluded and when the
Court was chosen, and it cannot be presumed that the United Kingdom or any other party involved
intended to disregard them.


       39. That being so, when it comes to establishing whether a State has consented to the Court
exercising jurisdiction over it, it would clearly be insufficient to claim that the State in question
“could expect” the implementation of a general dispute settlement scheme agreed to in the interest
of a third party, which does not expressly mention either the Court or that State’s individual rights,
to one day lead to that State’s individual responsibility being called into question before the Court.
It seems to me that it cannot reasonably be inferred from this kind of vague supposition that the State
concerned has clearly consented to the Court’s jurisdiction to rule on its rights and obligations in
proceedings in which it would not participate, moreover, with the result that it would be deprived of
the most basic right to defend its case. To the extent that it is even possible, the waiving of rights,


       40. While a sovereign State cannot be said to have, in such vague terms, given the Court a
blank cheque to rule indefinitely on its conduct, the details of which are moreover no more clearly
defined, it seems to me that this is especially true in the case of the United Kingdom, which, when
recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, has always proceeded with the utmost caution,
setting out the limitations of such recognition clearly and meticulously 33. It would be one thing for
the United Kingdom, in approving the very broad terms of Article IV of the Geneva Agreement, to
accept and promote the general principle that the territorial dispute that now existed exclusively
between Guyana and Venezuela should be settled by those two States without its “involvement”, but
quite another for it to accept firmly and definitively the Court’s jurisdiction to rule on its own
responsibility for unlawful acts somehow linked to this dispute, whatever those acts might be, in the
both much more specific and more hypothetical scenario that the Court should one day be seised.



        33 See e.g. the declaration deposited by the United Kingdom with the United Nations Secretary-General on 22 Feb.

2017, in accordance with Art. 36, para. 2, of the Statute of the Court.

                                                           - 14 -

        41. The Court has, in the past, invariably shown itself to be far more demanding before finding
that it has jurisdiction to rule on the lawfulness of the conduct of a sovereign State, as evidenced by
its consistent jurisprudence, in particular as regards forum prorogatum34.



                                                              *



      42. The second difficulty faced by the argument of the United Kingdom’s “consent” is, in my
view, the following.


       43. As already noted, the Court endeavours at length in its Judgment to show that the United
Kingdom waived the right to be a party to any of the settlement procedures envisioned in Article IV
of the Geneva Agreement, which makes no mention of it. The only conclusion that can be drawn
from this is that, in this case, the United Kingdom is thus in fact a “third party” as regards the ongoing
proceedings. Yet, under the consensual system established by the Statute of the Court, it is quite
simply inconceivable for the Court to agree to rule directly, in ongoing proceedings, on the conduct

       44. In its Judgment of 30 June 1995 in the East Timor case, the Court was absolutely clear on
this point: “Whatever the nature [even erga omnes] of the obligations invoked, the Court could not




        34 See e.g. Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 2008, p. 204, para. 62: consent to the Court’s jurisdiction must derive from an “unequivocal” indication of desire
and must itself be “voluntary” and “indisputable”. This jurisprudence is as long standing as it is consistent (see e.g. Rights
of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Minority Schools), Judgment No. 12, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 15, p. 24; Corfu Channel
(United Kingdom v. Albania), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 1948, I.C.J. Reports 1947-1948, p. 27; cf. Ambatielos
(Greece v. United Kingdom), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 39). Nowhere in the 1966 Geneva
Agreement do we find the expression of such consent on the part of the United Kingdom unambiguously permitting the
Court to rule directly, over a century after the facts, on its individual conduct between 1897 and 1899, whatever the as yet
to be precisely identified complaints made against it.
        35 Even in advisory proceedings, in which the Court is nonetheless not called upon to rule with the force of res

judicata on the rights of States, the Permanent Court of International Justice declined to exercise its jurisdiction, in one
well-known instance, on the grounds, in particular, that a State directly concerned “refused to take part [in the proceedings]
in any way” (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 236, para. 14,
and reference to Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 5).
         36 The Court has considered the principle of the “sovereign equality of States” to be “one of the fundamental

principles of the international legal order” and has emphasized that it applies, in particular, in the context of the peaceful
settlement of international disputes (Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data
(Timor-Leste v. Australia), Provisional Measures, Order of 3 March 2014, I.C.J. Reports 2014, p. 153, para. 27). On the
general relationship between equality of the parties, respect for the adversarial principle and the sound administration of
justice, cf. e.g. Judgment No. 2867 of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization upon a
Complaint Filed against the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (I),
p. 30, para. 47.

                                                            - 15 -

rule on . . . the lawfulness of the conduct of another State which is not a party to the case” 37. The
specialist literature also considers that the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over a State “not party
to the proceedings”, characterized as an “indispensable party” when the Court is called upon to rule
directly and as a principal matter on its rights and obligations in the context of proceedings between
other States 38. Parties to proceedings before the Court cannot act in the place of a sovereign third
party to defend the latter’s rights, nor can they be required to assume the burden of proving that that
State has performed its obligations. Conversely, the Court, as it has noted on various occasions, does

sufficient, in that frankly highly unusual context, to make them parties to the proceedings: this is
what happened in the case of Italy, but not Albania, on whose conduct the Court thus declined to
rule, finding that it could not render any binding decision, be it in respect of Albania, which remained
a third State, or the parties 41.


        46. The argument that there is alleged consent to the Court’s jurisdiction, tacitly expressed by
the United Kingdom in Article IV of the Geneva Agreement, thus does not lead as far as its supporters
would like. Even if such consent could be established — quod non — it would not be sufficient in
itself to enable the Court, in the circumstances of the case, to exercise its jurisdiction for the purpose




        37 East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29 (emphasis added). The Court

has repeatedly stated in its jurisprudence that it cannot exercise jurisdiction over a State that is “absent” from the
proceedings; see e.g. Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, and United States of America), Preliminary Question, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32, and the
declaration of President McNair, ibid., p. 35; Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras),
Application for Permission to Intervene, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1990, p. 116, para. 55, and p. 122, para. 73. In his
separate opinion appended to the Court’s Judgment in the Northern Cameroons case (Cameroon v. United Kingdom),
Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice explains that “[i]n the Monetary Gold case . . . the Court, while expressly finding that jurisdiction
had been conferred upon it by the Parties, declined to exercise it because of the absence of another State which the Court
regarded as a necessary party to the proceedings” (Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 102, fn. 4
(emphasis added)). It is hardly necessary to mention that, in all these instances, what the Court was referring to was the
need for an “indispensable third party” to become a party to the proceedings in order for the Court to be able to rule on its

     47. In view of the foregoing, it is apparent that no matter how the argument based on the United
Kingdom’s alleged “consent” is framed, it cannot provide a basis for rejecting Venezuela’s objection.


       48. Lastly, it is appropriate to recall here an obvious fact that is of great weight in the context
of this case: the letter of 30 January 2018 from the United Nations Secretary-General giving
notification of his decision to choose the Court as the means of settlement of the dispute, in
accordance with the terms of Article IV, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Agreement, was not sent to the
United Kingdom, even though it is clear from the Judgment of 18 December 2020 that this decision
constitutes the basis of the Court’s jurisdiction in this case and forms an integral part thereof 43. In
my view, this clearly confirms not only that the jurisdiction conferred on the Court in this case does
not extend to the United Kingdom and its individual acts, but also that the decision taken by the latter,
in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Agreement, to remain in all respects a third party to the
proceedings before the Court with all the consequences this entails, particularly as regards the
protection of its rights, was duly noted and taken into consideration when the basis of jurisdiction
“crystallized”.



                                                              *



       49. Without wishing to enter into the familiar debate as to whether a “restrictive” interpretation
should be applied when establishing a State’s consent to the jurisdiction of the Court 44, any novel
decision on a question of such cardinal importance as that of consent to jurisdiction 45 is hardly likely
to increase legal certainty or reinforce State confidence, which depends to a large extent on the
positions taken in this respect 46.

Shelf (Greece v. Turkey), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1978, p. 52.

                                                            - 17 -

       50. Moreover, stating, in one form or another, that the Geneva Agreement created, ratione
personae, some kind of jurisdictional link between the United Kingdom and the Parties that, in
particular, enables the Court, ratione materiae, to examine Venezuela’s complaints regarding the
United Kingdom’s conduct between 1897 and 1899, would open the door to possible procedural
developments that might significantly complicate the handling of the case and delay the settlement
of the dispute. Indeed, although in this case Venezuela could not seek to make counter-claims against
the United Kingdom, which remains a third party to the proceedings 47, it could nevertheless invoke
the recognition of this jurisdictional link to institute new proceedings against it 48, with the aim, for
example, of obtaining reparation for the unlawful acts it allegedly suffered at the hands of that State.
As the Court recalled in the LaGrand case (Germany v. United States of America),

        “[w]here jurisdiction exists over a dispute on a particular matter, no separate basis for
        jurisdiction is required by the Court to consider the remedies a party has requested for
        the breach of the obligation (Factory at Chorzów, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 22)” 49.

While the force of res judicata attaching to any judgment is relative and does not extend to third
parties 50, it is nevertheless difficult to see how, in the circumstances of this case, the Court could, in
a subsequent decision, reconsider any finding that upholds at this stage the argument that the United
Kingdom has consented to the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction over it.



                                                          *       *



       51. These issues — as serious as they are numerous — do not appear to have escaped the
Court, which takes great care in the Judgment to avoid any impression of support for the Applicant’s
argument on this point. Indeed, while Guyana attempted to show that the preconditions for applying
the Monetary Gold jurisprudence were not met in this case — first, because the United Kingdom no
longer had any interest that was likely to constitute the subject-matter of the proceedings, and,
second, because the latter had in any event “consented” to the Court’s jurisdiction and to the exercise
of that jurisdiction for the purpose of settling the dispute — the Court did its utmost to avoid having


against Guyana — for the reasons set out above, relating in particular to non-succession in respect of international
responsibility — is a prime example of the inequalities between States and the possible violations of their procedural rights
to which the argument of the United Kingdom’s “consent” might inadvertently lead.

procedure significantly more complex.

        50 While that is the principle, here again we see the difficulties that could be caused by any endorsement of the

argument based on the United Kingdom’s alleged “consent”. Indeed, it is legitimate to question whether it is consistent
with the principle of the equality of States and the sound administration of justice for a State that has consented to the
exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction over it not to be bound by its decision because that State decided to remain a third party
to the proceedings. This is no doubt a serious anomaly, reflecting the contrived and incongruous nature of such an argument.
From this perspective too, consent to jurisdiction and the status of third party to the proceedings appear utterly
irreconcilable.
        51 See para. 107.

       52. In my view, this formally different approach, as creative as it may be, is nonetheless not
without its problems. First of all, while it is true that the Court is required only to rule on the parties’
submissions, without necessarily having to pronounce on each of the reasons put forward by them 52,
avoiding any decision on the arguments that formed the bulk of the debate between the parties
certainly appears to be incompatible with the requirements of the sound administration of justice and
is likely to generate discontent and frustration. Beyond this, however, the most important question
seems to me to be whether this approach actually makes it possible to avoid the above-mentioned
pitfalls of the argument that the United Kingdom’s “consent” renders the Monetary Gold
jurisprudence inapplicable. In my opinion, it does not.


       53. The main problem, as I have already pointed out, lies in the fact that since the means of
dispute settlement chosen under Article IV of the Geneva Agreement is the Court — which is
completely different in this respect from the other means of settlement — its Statute must be applied
and must take priority. To claim that the Agreement resolves everything by providing for the dispute
to be settled between the Parties without the United Kingdom’s involvement inevitably raises the
question whether, once the Court has been seised, the general provisions of Article IV are sufficient
to enable it to consider unlawful acts of the United Kingdom that have not previously been defined
in precise legal terms, or, in other words, whether those provisions are capable of giving the Court
jurisdiction over such acts. No matter how the Court’s approach is framed, we inevitably return to

able to do so. The need for its unequivocal consent to the Court’s jurisdiction and for its participation
in the proceedings in order for the Court to be able to make a ruling in respect of it remain the same
and equally binding, be it in the context of the interpretation and application of the Geneva
Agreement or in the context of applying the Monetary Gold jurisprudence. Ultimately, therefore, this
formally different approach does nothing to change the difficulties encountered above, nor does it
appear capable of providing a solution to them.



                                                      *      *



     55. For all the foregoing reasons, I find myself unable to accept either the Applicant’s
arguments or, regretfully, the alternative approach adopted by the Court.



                                                      *      *



       56. While, unlike the majority, I am therefore of the opinion that the extensive Monetary Gold
jurisprudence applies in principle to the present case, and that there was no compelling reason for

       52 See the well-known distinction made by the Court in this regard in the case concerning Minquiers and Ecrehos

(France/United Kingdom), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 52.

                                                           - 19 -

the Court to depart from it, I nonetheless consider there to be a clear difference between this case and
the Monetary Gold and East Timor cases.


       57. Indeed, in those cases, the facts — whose lawfulness the Court had no choice but to
determine before it could rule on the claims before it — were well established. In the Monetary Gold
case, the Legislative Decree of 13 January 1945 ordering the confiscation of the assets of the National
Bank of Albania, 88.5 per cent of which were owned by Italy, had clearly been adopted and its entry
into force was undisputed. In the East Timor case, Indonesia’s presence on that territory, which had
been the subject of numerous resolutions of United Nations organs, was undeniable. And in the

to the Court. However, according to counsel for Venezuela, only the “tip of the iceberg” has been
revealed at this stage 53. If the Court were to decide to decline to exercise its jurisdiction, solely on
the basis of the impressionistic picture of the facts thus painted, it risks arbitrarily depriving the
Applicant of its right to a fair hearing. What is more, there is a danger that the Court would establish
a precedent that might encourage future respondents artificially to entangle the rights of third parties
with their own claims, so as to escape the Court’s judgment.


       59. Furthermore, to uphold at this stage Venezuela’s objection based on the United Kingdom’s
absence from the proceedings would, in my view, amount to prejudging the merits, since such a
decision would necessarily imply that the Court considers the facts relied on by the Respondent to
be established, despite their still rather vague nature. That said, in deciding to reject the objection,
the Court could have similarly prejudged the merits had it not chosen to base its rejection solely on
the consideration that, even if the United Kingdom’s alleged conduct were established, the Monetary
Gold jurisprudence would not apply in this case on account of the “prior” arrangement made under
Article IV of the Geneva Agreement.


       60. In light of the conclusions reached above, it is my view that the Rules of Court, as
conceived in substance since 1972, left the Court with only one option: to declare that the objection
raised by the Respondent does not have an exclusively preliminary character, and examine it at the
merits stage 54.
